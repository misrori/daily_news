        "transcript": "Your 401k just got caught in the crossfire of the biggest banking rule change since 1971. And most Americans have absolutely no clue it's already happening. As of right now, a new set of banking regulation has fundamentally rewired how the entire financial system values assets. These are not proposals. They are already active already forcing banks to act and scramble. And if you've got any kind of money in your retirement account, the purchasing power of that money is being systematically transferred to those who understand what's happening, which is why this video is so incredibly important. Talking about potentially losing 30 to 40% of your retirement in just a couple of years. But here's the thing, the same rule change creating massive risk also creates the biggest wealthb buildinging opportunity in a generation. So, by the end of this video, my promise to you is that you understand exactly what's happening behind the scenes at the Fed, at major banks like JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, and what the smart money is quietly doing right now. More importantly, you know, the three specific moves you can make now to protect your retirement and potentially profit from this big beautiful shift. My name is Felix Pman, exinvesting bank. It's Winston back there who does all the research and hard thinking around here. And we've watched these banks play this game for years. And what's happening right now? Well, it's really different. And that's also the key reason behind us founding the go academy where we've taught about 20,000 students how to learn to invest like the institutions, not like retail sheep. They tend to get slaughtered. I'm also the co-founder of trademission.io where we track exactly what the big money is doing in real time. So the whole mission here is to teach regular investors, which is what I used to be, how to stop being the exit liquidity and start playing the same game the wealthy play. So this training here is going to walk you through the single biggest regulatory shift since in banking since Nixon ended the gold standard. And just like in 1971, most people won't understand what's happened until it's too late. The difference is you're going to be ahead of the curve if you stick around. So, we're right now in the final phase of something called the Basel 3 endgame officially went into effect across major countries. Now, I know Basel 3 sounds about as exciting as watching paint dry. The mainstream media barely covers it because it's technical. It's boring. And frankly, most journalists don't understand banking regulations. But let me give you the official translation in a way everybody can understand. This rule fundamentally changes what banks consider safe versus risky on their balance sheet. And when you change what's safe, you change where trillions of dollars flow. So what's Basel 3? Well, it's a set of international banking regulations that were created after the 2008 liberal financial crisis to prevent another meltdown. Well, that's the official line. Stay with that. Uh, so the idea was simple. Make banks hold more capital, reduce insane leverage, and stop the kind of reckless gambling that destroyed the global economy. Sounds good in theory, but and this is where the regulators got a little bit sneaky, they have reclassified gold and silver. Allocated physical gold has been reclassified as a tier one highquality liquid asset. Let me translate that into English. Banks can now count physical gold at 100% of its value towards their reserves. It's the same as cash or government bonds. Think about that for a second. For decades, the narrative has been gold is some sort of barbarous relic. It doesn't produce any cash flow. Just a shiny thing for the lunatics out there. You know, the ones who hide ammo under the bed. And now the same regulators and central bankers quietly reclassified gold as what? Real money. the safest, most liquid asset a bank can hold. It's kind of ironic, isn't it? So, what does it mean for you? What does it mean for banks? Banks no longer need to hold extra capital against their physical gold holding. It frees up money on their balance sheet and it makes gold more attractive to hold. But there is a flip side to that was about physical gold. the unallocated gold, which is often described as paper gold or ETFs that don't have a physical backing, some sort of derivative product that some lunatic came up with on Wall Street. They're basically now treated as toxic waste. If you hold paper as a bank, you need to have 85% stable funding factor. What what does that mean? Okay, basically what it says is that it is now very very expensive for banks to hold this fake paper fake paper gold and fake paper silver. So they either need to buy the physical metal to back up the position or they need to quit this paper game. So why the heck does that matter for you and your 401k and your retirement accounts? Because most retirement accounts are heavily weighted towards what? Bonds, right? And guess what? You're getting crushed because bonds don't pay you very much. Inflation is about the same as bonds. So you're basically just sitting there and you're just watching your money go down the toilet. But the asset class that central banks and regulators just reclassified, gold, has surged insanely in 2026, right? This is gold. Now, this is silver. Alltime high, 205% up year on year as I'm recording this. So, the smart money, the central banks, the sovereign wealth funds, and now commercial banks are piling into what? precious metals and retail investors, well, they're mostly sitting in cash, bonds, and you know, the occasional ship. What does it mean? Well, your purchasing power just got evaporated compared to the central banks and the JP Morgans and the Goldman Sachs who bought gold and silk. Now, before we go deeper, if you want to learn how Wall Street, those same buggers, find winning trades and how to position yourself ahead of these massive shifts, I believe that is possible. I believe the pattern is always there. The writing is always on the wall. If you want to learn that, I'm going to do something special for you. I'm going to run a live session this Saturday. It's free. You can sign up at felix.org/training. And I'll walk you through exactly how to read the market like an institution. At least sort of level one and two, three and four. I'll tell you about that too if you want to get some men from guys who've worked in institutions which is how I learned. I'll also cover that. But come and join the free training to start with felix.org/training. It's in the discipion down below. So make sure you grab yourself a seat and be on tap. But for four decades, 40 years, the price of silver particularly has been suppressed artificially through something that they call naked short selling. Why naked? Because let me explain how this works. Big banks, think JP Morgan, City, they would sell paper contracts without actually owning the physical metal. It's a bit like writing a check when you have no money in the bank. like $0 in the bank, but you're writing million-dollar checks, right? Same thing. So, they could flood the market with sell orders, which would drive the price down, and they pocket the difference when they bought them back at lower prices. Now, maybe you think, \"Oh, Felix, that can't be true. The system can't be that rigged.\" Well, JP Morgan was fined $920 million in 2020 for manipulating the metals market for a decade. Not a couple of weeks, for a decade. Nobody apparently noticed that there's an entire exchange out there that does that. Now, Basel 3 kills the paper game. Under these new rules, this game is phenito. It is finished. or at least it is expensive to play. The cost of holding these short positions has gone to the freaking moon and banks are therefore being forced to do one of two things. What are they doing? Either they buy physical metal to back their paper positions or they close out their shorts entirely. Guess what? At a massive loss because silver's gone up 205% in a year. So, they're unwinding. That's what we're seeing what's happening in these markets. Prices spiked because banks were pulling their sell orders off the table. They knew this rule was coming and they didn't want to be caught holding paper shorts when the music stopped. Here's a dirty little secret. The silver market has a paper to physical ratio of roughly 300 to1. There are 300 IUS pieces of paper for one piece of silver. Gold is a little bit better. only 100 to one 100 fake pieces of paper for one piece of gold. Now imagine what happens when banks and institutions start demanding physical delivery instead of settling in cash which is what they've always done starting to happen and the entire paper pyramid collapses and Basel 3 incentivizes this. So who gets uh burned here? Well, if you hold paper silver or paper gold, basically a promise from your bank to give you metal someday, you're at risk. Banks are now incentivized to close these accounts or convert them into cash. And you could wake up one morning to an email saying, \"Congratulations, we've cashed out your silver position at, you know, $60.\" And you're like, \"Why did I not get, you know, hundreds whatever it's trading at?\" So, the banks win. So, be careful what you hold. Who else wins? People holding physical metals, the actual coins, the actual bars. People who understand that in a world where paper claims are being unwound, physical scarcity is king. I talked to a gold and silver dealer. And he said to me, you can buy more. I only hold stuff in physical storage places obviously because it's a risk on having it at home. And he said, you can buy more, but it'll take four months to get it delivered. That's how big the physical shortage is. And industrial users and you can get me started on those. They're panicking. These are companies that are big companies. We're talking about Tesla. We're talking about Samsung. You know, big big big companies. They need physical silver. And they're a race. They're competing with banks to secure supply before it's loed up in bank vaults. But guess what? There's even more to this. The official story out there is that we are in some sort of soft landing nirvana. Inflation is cooling. The labor market is strong. But the reality is 2.7%. The Fed is cutting rates. They're going to keep cutting it aggressively this year because we're going to get a new Fed poodle. Sorry, Fed chair. And this inflation data, by the way, is just made up, sorry, collected by the US government. So it's complete nonsense. At the same time, people like JP Morgan, the people who seem to run the country, um they're warning of what? Stagflation this year, this very year. That's the worst of both worlds, which means the economy is kind of flat and you get inflation. It's sort of like being stuck in quicksand while someone sells your wallet or file. So, what's driving it? Housing costs. It's a big chunk of inflation. It's going up 3.7% year-over-year. Wages. You people seem to keep asking for pay rises. Now, that's a selfish thing to do for the benefit of us investors. You should work for free. I'm just kidding. No, you deserve massive pay increases because inflation is screwing you royally. And then we have tariffs. They're adding a one-time increase to to costs. Government says it doesn't, but of course it does. They also said inflation was transitory. Remember the same people. They also said co vaccinations are a brilliant idea. Now we got controversial. Go nuts in the comments. Go on. But the big one is this one. Government spending. We're looking at a 20 trillion deficit over the next decade. Probably more. How are they paying for that? They're printing money to cover the deficit. There is more money around. Do you think money is worth more or less when you create more of it? And then we have a little bit labor supply shock because all the immigration significantly slowed in the US and that may or may not be a good thing. Again, that's for you to decide. Uh not my country. But there's less immigrants about doing jobs. The boomers, the lazy buggers are retiring. Um so there is this labor supply shock and then we got the whole AI story. We're not going to get into that today. So, the Fed is in a difficult position, right? Some might say impossible. What are they going to do? Well, they're going to cut rates to help the economy and help Trump get reelected, which means inflation gets worse. Maybe not immediately, but sort of 12 to 18 months later, that's how it works, right? Um, they're not going to raise rates. It's not going to happen because he's going to elect and pick a poodle. Um, what are they actually going to do? They're going to print money and then they hope it'll all turn out all right. And the people running the government at pretty old age, they don't really care all that much. I think that's got a lot to do with it as well. Now, what happens in a world where you print money and gold and silver are now the real backing system, the only thing that actually retains value while money is being printed into nirvana. Well, remember 2021, 2022 when they printed $4 trillion and the Fed said it's temporary. It's transitory. Nothing to worry about. Well, we got 9% inflation. This is official government data, which of course is a load of bollocks. So, it was a lot more than that, right? It was double digit inflation. Did your pay rice go up to 9%? No, it didn't. So, what happened? You got screwed, right? And that's what this whole thing is about. I want you to get unscrewed because otherwise you are left holding assets that get worth less and less and less. Now we need to go east a little bit. China, as Trump says, they've been playing this game for a long time. So while Western banks were paying these paper gains, China's actually built a different system. The Shanghai gold exchange is a physical exchange. There is no paper, no fractional nonsense, only real metals. So they were actually in line with Basel 3 standards a long time before the West. And we seem to be copying that model whether you like that or not. Now on top of that, the smarter countries, you know, the ones that aren't run by complete lunatics like Poland, one of the smarter European plays at present, they bought 95 tons of gold last year, the largest reported official sector purchase. Brazil added 43 tons. Okay, let's not get into the Brazilian government. And I mean, that wasn't the greatest thing. Kazakhstan, Beckistan, Czech Republic, they're all buying gold. The numbers for China are probably a little bit larger than what's officially being reported, but 95% of central bankers in the world expect to increase their gold reserves. JP Morgan, you should know because they uh manipulate the market. Sorry, they um participate in the market. That's the correct phrase apparently. Um they think 775 tons of central bank gold purchases will happen this year. one of the bigliest purchases in modern history. So what we're witnessing here is a slow bureaucratic shift to a multi-polar monetary system. What does that mean? Well, the dollar denominated era is ending. Not with a bang, but gradually with regulatory fine print, but nobody notices. gold is elevated to the status of US debt, US treasuries, which is what every bank in the world's been holding. And what does it mean? Well, the US deficits become harder and harder to finance. So, what do they do? They have to print more and more money. We're looking at 20 trillion plus over the next decade. Just in the next couple of weeks, by the way, they're going to print some serious amount of money. Here it is, 55 billion over the next 3 weeks. That is one of the biggest money injections into the economy that we have ever ever seen. Crazy. And no one's talking about it. No one's talking about it, right? So this is not some sort of crazy conspiracy. No, this is actually economic data that is published by the US government and the Federal Reserve. We're anything but reserved. So what does that mean for you? What does it actually mean for you? What's the actionable takeaway here? Well, say a sovereign wealth fund, one of the big ones, trillion dollar wealth funds, they're out there. What if they shift a little bit away from US dollar bonds because they watch the video, um, that's where they get their information and they buy, say, $10 billion of physical silver. You get a price explosion because the supply is there. But really, this 6040 classic portfolio, in my humble opinion, this is not financial advice. I'm not a financial adviser. You know, Winston, where did Winston go? he may be um it's dead. That was the standard advice, right? Bonds are safe, stable, predictable, low risk. Well, in a world where you have high inflation, and I mean, I just don't believe that it's 2.7%. Tell me what how you feel what inflation really is, bonds pay you like 3%, what's your return? It's like 0.3% before you pay taxes. So, you're losing money. Why? Because gold's up 72%, silver's up 25%. So these guys, they get richer and richer and richer. And all these guys are the banks. So the regulators just made it official. Gold is now the new bond. And they have scarcity. You can't print gold. You can dig it up, but it takes a bloody long time and it's bloody painful to do. So if you hold physical metal, it's yours. The bank can't default on it. And your question might be, is it too late? Should I buy gold? Should I buy silver? Again, it's not financial advice. I always give you my opinion. You're going to come to your own conclusion on that. But every feared currency in history has eventually failed. So, every paper currency has always failed. Gold and silver have actually retained value. You can go back like 5,000 years plus. Now, could silver be the better opportunity? The gold, I think, is great, but where it's currently trading, it is out of reach of a lot of people. Silver is still much much more affordable even though it's at all-time highs and the ratio between gold to silver is still very wide. Silver tends to outperform gold in bull markets is more volatile but it tends to outperform. And this is why I think it's important. Gold has two drivers. There is the monetary demand. So the banks, the central banks, right? Same as gold. But then there is also the industrial demand, the EVs, the solars, the AI chips that all needs silver and there is a limited supply of silver that is actually above ground that we can access. So Basil 3 is forcing banks to buy physical. Industrial users are panic buying already. Retail investors are waking up to this and all that demand is chasing a market that's been suppressed for 40 years. Yeah. 40 years that's you know JP Morgan's world important to be I think in the allocated space which is physical stored in your name in somewhere safe and insured there are physical ETFs check out whether yours is physical or not whether they actually hold the silver do you believe them ownership work it's a whole another story but that's those are the better ones the paper ones are going to be a problem because we might see some of these institutions fail potentially So you don't want to own a claim on some metal that doesn't actually exist. You become an unsecured creditor if they collapse and uh good luck right now. Basil 3 is basically also trying to get rid of the whole unallocated market because why? It's insanely risky made up world where people trade stuff that doesn't exist and make money out of it doesn't shouldn't really exist. So the banks have this problem. They don't have enough physical gold and silver for the new rules. So, they must buy gold and silver on the open market. That buying drives prices up, but they also hold short positions, which mean they lose money on those if the price goes up. So, basically complying with the rules bankrupts their trading desks. So, what's going to happen? Well, the Fed is intervening with bailouts. They're already doing that. They've been bailing institutions out the last couple of weeks quietly. they call it some sort of weird adjusted money whatever you know um so they're printing more money and that's why we're seeing the biggest money printing we've seen in um actually history I believe in the next 3 weeks and I believe it's going to continue for the rest of the year because this thing loop is going to going to going to going to keep going now have we seen this movie before let's go back a little bit in 1933 FDR signed the executive order 6102. It forced Americans to turn in their gold at a fixed price of $2067 per ounce. The government then revalued that at 30 $35. So it's an instant wealth transfer as in theft from the citizens to the government, right? 69% gain for those who held gold, but you weren't allowed to. So wealth transfers have been done before by governments. In 71, Nixon closes the gold window, ended the dollar's convertability to gold. Why? They said, \"We need more flexibility in this modern economy.\" But no, the US have simply printed too many dollars. They couldn't back them by gold because they didn't have any gold. What are you seeing in the paper markets right now with the banks? Well, they've basically printed money, paper gold, and they don't have the gold. What followed? Decade of stack inflation and gold and silver prices went to the freaking moon. What are we seeing right now? Basil 3, the stealth return to gold. It's the opposite. It's the reverse of 1971, but it's not being announced. Sort of being buried in technical banking regulations, but the effect is the same. Gold and by extension silver, it's being recognized as real money. Again, it's not a coincidence. It's a response to the unsustainable debt, the crazy inflation, and some sort of anchor that tells us what something is actually worth. So, history rhymes, and every monetary shift has done what created winners and created plenty of losers. You decide which side of the fence you want to be on once you've done your own digging. So, what what should you do right now? Again, I'm not a financial adviser. I'm just a guy who happened to be a banker for a little while. He's got a very smart golden retriever. Winston, come on here. Come on here. Come on. Sit down. Sit down. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. Sit. He's got a very large nose. Very good at sniffing ideas out. But what are we going to do? Look at your portfolio. Look simply at what you actually own. Do you own lots of bonds? Do you own any metals? Are those ETFs, are they actually physically backed or not? I would look at allocating some money to physical metals. Now, this is going to be speculative. Silver is going to go up and down a lot more than gold. Depends on your horizon. Again, this is just my opinion, not advice. I would dollar cost average into that. I would make a plan whereby I put certain amounts of money into these assets over a period of time. Why? Because it's going to make you sleep better at night. I would put it into secure storage. I would not keep it at home because someone's going to know that somebody's going to come around with a shotgun and take it from you. And I would watch what I own in terms of assets. What does your pie look like, right? Is it stocks? Is it gold? Is it bonds? What is it? And then I would think about whether this is a good fit for my risk management, for where I am in life, my income, my age, all that kind of good stuff, right? We have a tool actually in our community which does that sort of calculation for you. And I would stay informed of this. I'd stay informed of the what the central banks are doing, what inflation is doing, what Fed policy is doing. One way to do that would be to follow this channel. We're probably going to keep you informed, especially that guy. Um, but if you want to get the playbook really how this is works, how I learned this, come and join me on Saturday, be live and we look at how we position ourselves for every trend there ever was and every trend there ever will be. Now, we can learn that skill to become better at managing our money. Because you're a money manager and you're like, \"No, no, no. I'm a I'm a whatever. You're a plumber. You're a whatever. It doesn't matter what your job is. You have money and you're investing it. Otherwise, you wouldn't be watching this video. So, you're a money manager, but you are probably less trained in money management than you're trained in pretty much everything else, including most sports you play or have played because you had coaches for those, but you don't for your money. And I think that's a massive mistake. And if we fix that, I think we can get to much much better outcomes. And that's really the goal here, isn't it, Winston? Winston says, \"Yes, then let's go and have a snack.\" I love you for watching this. If you found some value in this, I'd ask just one thing and one thing only. Share it with more people so more people get to understand what's actually going on out there. And I wish you tremendous year. All the best. Look at your portfolio right now. Whether you know it or not, what's happening to gold is about to impact every single dollar you have invested. I'm not talking about some slowmoving trend that'll play out of"
