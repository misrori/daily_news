        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Karp just made huge predictions regarding the future of AI in one of the most revealing interviews I've seen from a tech CEO. I've pulled the three best clips from this interview and stay with me because the second and third clips are absolutely gold. Alex answers two of the most important questions regarding AI in the world today. Check this out. There's so much technology was created from defense whether it was the internet uh GPS. How do you envision this translating from defense and military to corporations to businesses to society? >> Well, first of all, the the fact that it's basically a purely raw naked environment means that you actually know the ground truth of what could work independent of what enterprises think can work. And the generaliz the think at a at a at a high level it's almost one to one translatable but precisely because as just to take enterprises in general not all enterprises tend to want to over time become like every other enterprise so if you take five you know a enterprise and b enterprise and c enterprise they're in the same market their tech infrastructure is trying to make them into the same enterprise they have the same orchart >> sure >> they have presumably roughly the same they have the same data and infrastructure and what you learn on the battlefield is that and in life is that's that's not particularly valuable. What is very valuable is an enterprise can do something no enterprise in the world can do and so that is the goal of every single military in intelligence service. In fact, all these intelligence service and militaries have their own specialization. And so when we went to commerce, like what we're saying is how can we make your insurance come the way you underwrite? How can we make that to your tribal knowledge about underwriting? How can we transform this to knowledge everyone has to a knowledge only you have and with efficiencies that no one else has. So as an example on the battlefield one of the most important issues I is how do you acquire data process it and then put it into a framework where it can be actioned either from an intelligence perspective yeah so just obviously what does a business do in the end of the day what is a business doing I mean it is so for example especially in anything underwriting banking hospital intakes it's information it's information it's sorting the information in a way that you have a a distinct advantage over other people who are similarly situated uh and that that advantage can't be eviscerated easily and so de facto for what you can't what you're doing on the battlefield with our products without getting happy to is like what you're doing with ontology and foundry in some cases on the battlefield but definitely in like commercial organizations across the world but especially in America is when you approach the underwriter or the hospital we power tons and tons of hospitals right >> they have an intake problem they all have an intake problem. They all have a shortage of doctors and nurses. They are working in a low margin environment, but every single one has a different way of processing their patients according to what their specialty is and the kind of patients they don't do well with. And how do you manage that? And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10 15 times faster than you could before. >> It's January again and by now you've started making resolutions to make the new year better for you. But the smartest people are already on the road to master that one skill that matters most in 2026. AI. From just a simple text model in 2019, AI has evolved to detecting diseases, automating work, and even running tasks in your sleep. And that's why I want to introduce to you the sponsor of this video, Outskill. They are hosting a 2-day AI mastermind training session live this Saturday and Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern on both days. And right now is the perfect moment to join because you can get in absolutely free as part of the new year upskilling fest. This 16 hours AI training has already built 10 million plus AI first professionals worldwide and is rated 4.9 out of five on Trustpilot. This is where you learn how to build AI agents that plan, write, execute, and report for you. Automate workflows that even run while you sleep. Use AI to save hours every week, and get an unfair advantage at work. Not just that, you'll also learn how to profit from these skills. Seats are limited. Use the link in the description to join. >> It savees a lot of lives. Um, it also, interestingly, because you're processing the LLM in an ontology, you have a structure. It all despite what people may want to believe, it also bolster civil liberties because now you can say, well, I mean, just simple questions. Was someone processed based on economic uh considerations or were they based uh were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see unless you have like there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or but it's actually exactly the opposite. We do care and you know showing is caring. It's like we can granularly show uh why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the the business itself. Palanteer learned how to build irreplaceable competitive advantages on the battlefield and now they're applying that exact playbook to every enterprise in America. So what Karp is describing here is something most people miss about Palanteer's business model. The defense work isn't completely separate from the commercial work. It's the same thing. On the battlefield, you're acquiring data, processing it, and putting it into a framework where it can be actioned. That's literally what a hospital does with patient intake. That's literally what an insurance company does with underwriting. The stakes are different, but the problem is identical. And Alex makes this point about every enterprise wanting to become like every other enterprise. Same orchart, same tech infrastructure, same processes. That's the default gravity of business. But what you learn in military and intelligence work is that sameness has no value. The only thing that matters is whether you can do something no one else can do. So when Panteer goes into a commercial company, they're asking, \"How do we make you fundamentally different from your competitors in a way that can't be copied?\" The hospital example is really specific and worth thinking about. Every hospital has an intake problem. Every hospital has a shortage of doctors and nurses. Every hospital operates on thin margins. Those are the same problems. But every hospital also has different specialtities, different patient populations, different workflows they've developed over the years. Palunteer's approach is to take that tribal knowledge, the stuff that lives in your heads of your best people, and turn it into a system that can process patients multiple times faster. And then Alex mentions this civil liberties angle that is kind of surprising coming from a defense contractor. At least that's what you would think. But this is Palanteer. Because you're processing everything through an ontology, a structured map if you like, of how your organization actually works. You can actually answer questions you couldn't answer before. Was someone rejected because of their economic background? Was someone treated differently based on where they came from? Most organizations have no idea. They'd have to dig through thousands of records manually. Palanteer can show it granularly in real time and the business actually makes money from the same system. That's a rare case where better ethics and better economics align. So that's the translation from defense to commercial. But here's where it gets interesting. Why isn't everyone just copying this approach? In this next clip, Alex Carb explains why most AI adoption fails and why Palanteer Salesforce keeps shrinking even as the company grows faster than ever. This one's a gem. >> What is the basic hindrance in the adaption of of of the of AI? Uh is it just um legacy systems, legacy issues? What how do you how do we accelerate the adoption that it's good for humanity? >> Our adoption accelerates beyond our capacity. I think if you just buy large language models off the shelf and try to do any of this, it won't work. >> It's a commodity. It's a and well also it's not precise enough. It like you can't do underwriting with a you can't you couldn't do any of these things that are regulated. The problem with adoption at this point is people have tried things that just can never work >> like buying you borrow a large language model you put it on your stack and you wonder why you know it's like not working. And so what you're going to see especially in America is people trying to do something like what we do with ontology maybe by hand because once you build a software layer to orchestrate and manage the lounge language models in in a language that your enterprise understands you actually can create value. Like there's a lot of discussions like are we in an AI bubble? What is the meaning of the bubble? Well it's like I I think what if anything we're just in a lag where there's a lot of AI some of it works. Again, if you go back to the battlefield context, everybody in the world assumed this would not work, but now it does work. And so now the question isn't does it work, but how can we get it to work for my country? And this is exactly what's happening in companies. It's like, oh, this company it worked, mine didn't. What are you doing? >> Like for example, I mean, if you want to just make it like parochial to us, Palanteer barely has a salesforce. In fact, it seems to be getting smaller every time I go see them. And it it's not because we're trying to save on the unit economics. It's actually because it is a low trust environment in AI. People have tried lots of stuff. A lot of it hasn't worked. But if you've delivered stuff that does work, why do you need a salesforce? Like you you just >> it sells itself. >> Well, you have to say, \"Hey, don't talk to us.\" >> And then that's that's that's that's on commercial. in government at this point it's really we don't like we don't we it's it's it's very hard to export simply because we have to train the people and we have limited bandwidth >> I was going to say that's your limited bandwidth the training once somebody takes on your your software >> well in the government contest every every country like obviously has the equivalent of a security clearance right so to use our to build to build ma project maven or maven into your architecture you're going to need somebody with the highest level of clearance that also is technical and most technical people unfortunately are not going after the highest level of clearance. So there are very very few people like that. So the that that resource is super scarce. Uh and then they have to be trained and that that takes that can take a while and and and then you also have to have like anything you really have to believe in this and really think it's important and you know not everybody fits in that category. Most companies buy AI like they buy software, and that's exactly why it doesn't work for them. The problem with AI adoption right now is that people tried things that can never work. They bought a large language model off the shelf, plugged it into their existing stack, and wondered why nothing happened next. It's a commodity. It's not precise enough. You can't do regulated work like underwriting or hospital intake with raw GPT. The model doesn't understand your business, your data, your workflows, your constraints. What Palanteer builds is an orchestration layer, the ontology, which Alice Karp keeps mentioning that sits between the AI model and your actual enterprise. It translates what the AI can do into language your business understands. Without that layer, you're just playing with a chatbot. With that layer, you're actually creating value. And this is why Alex says, \"We're not in an AI bubble.\" Exactly. We're in a lag. The technology works. Palanteer's proved it on the battlefield, but most companies haven't figured out how to make it work for them yet. And the Salesforce comment was pretty great. Palanteer barely has one. That sounds like a weird flex for a software company, but think about what it means. In a low trust environment where everyone tried AI and has been burnt, the only thing that sells is results. If you've actually delivered value, if your product actually works, word spreads. customers come to you in government. Karp says they have to tell people don't talk to us because they can't handle the demand. The bottleneck becomes training and deployment. And that bottleneck is real. To deploy something like Maven, their military targeting system, you need someone with the highest security clearance who also has deep technical ability. Those people basically don't exist. Technical talent doesn't usually pursue clearances. So you have this weird constraint where demand is infinite, but the ability to fulfill it is capped by a tiny pool of qualified people. That's not a business problem most software companies have. It's actually closer to how consulting firms work. Don't get me wrong, Palanteer is not a consultant company. Let's not go down that rabbit hole again. One of the key differences is that the work product is transformational instead of just advisory. So Palanteer has this bottleneck of talent, but what does that mean for everyone else's jobs? In this final clip, Alex reveals what he thinks about AI destroying our jobs. This clip is an absolute banger. Check it out. >> You you suggested repeatedly about how AI could strengthen foundations for an economy, especially we're seeing that in the United States. Um, how rapidly can AI change the growth trajectory? because you you you mentioned that earlier about how it could improve the e economies the well-being of companies there in a lot of these things there's a speed question but um I think like with a lot of our companies it's like we can take out in the area we go in up to 80% of your cost and improve your top line dramatically but it really depends on the use case and what we're And then there's the speed function which is we can in the past 5 years ago that would take us a year. >> Sure. >> Now it could take a week. >> Week. Yeah. >> Let me further that question though. I'm sure it's on the minds of some people here. Is AI going to create jobs or destroy jobs overall? >> It Yeah. I think one of the unfortunate things of the narrative in the west is it it will destroy humanity's jobs of like you know you went to an elite school and you studied philosophy. Use myself as an example. Um >> I did too. >> Yeah. You it hopefully you have some other skill. That one is going to be hard to market. Uh and >> it was hard to market. >> It was hard to market. very hard uh with a good education, >> a very very strong education. If you can get a job, you might keep it at the heart. That's what I always thought was like if I finally get a job, I'll probably keep it and do well, but I'm not sure who's going to give me my first job. But like techn like technicians if you're a vocational technician >> or like like we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing and they went to high school and now they're very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly and those jobs are going to become more valuable. Not to diverge into my usual political screeds, but it there are will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training. I do think these these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have larges scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill because >> what about the foundation for white collar work in Europe and the United States has been through the universities but I just heard you say we're going to need more vocational men and women and they may they're going to be but are you also insinuating we're probably going to need less white collar? I think like I think what we need to do is yes, but I I think we need different ways of testing aptitude. You you know there are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y. Like if you could manage one of our system like just the person managing our maven system in the US Army is a former police officer who I think went to a junior college and they're doing very very high-end very complicated targeting globally and that person actually is irreplaceable and I think in the past the way we tested for aptitude uh would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person's talents are and would they been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Yes. Um and but I think the the a I tend to even inside Palunteer if you look at inside Palunteer what am I really doing all day? I'm want walking around figuring out what is someone's outlier aptitude and then I'm putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they're great at. As you know, maybe for 18 years, everyone thought we were like a business joke. And now lots of business people want my advice. You know, the only people who don't want my advice at Palanteer about business are Palunteer engineers. They're like, \"Hey, Alex, I have an idea about how we could just be in a much better company.\" And it's it's always like, \"Yeah, it's like it's like literally McDonald's, but it's like we should have some titles and you should stop speaking in public.\" And uh yeah, and then I mean there's probably right about speaking in public sometimes. certainly admit that. >> I don't think you uh I don't think you did anything wrong today. >> Yeah. So, uh yeah, thank you for that high praise. >> One of the keys to success is setting the bar very low. >> Yes. No, I I don't believe that's how you uh operate palent."
