        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Karp just made huge predictions regarding the future of AI in one of the most revealing interviews I've seen from a tech CEO. I've pulled the three best clips from this interview and stay with me because the second and third clips are absolutely gold. Alex answers two of the most important questions regarding AI in the world today. Check this out. There's so much technology was created from defense whether it was the internet uh GPS. How do you envision this translating from defense and military to corporations to businesses to society? >> Well, first of all, the the fact that it's basically a purely raw naked environment means that you actually know the ground truth of what could work independent of what enterprises think can work. And the generaliz the think at a at a at a high level it's almost one to one translatable but precisely because as just to take enterprises in general not all enterprises tend to want to over time become like every other enterprise so if you take five you know a enterprise and b enterprise and c enterprise they're in the same market their tech infrastructure is trying to make them into the same enterprise they have the same orchart >> sure >> they have presumably roughly the same they have the same data and infrastructure and what you learn on the battlefield is that and in life is that's that's not particularly valuable. What is very valuable is an enterprise can do something no enterprise in the world can do and so that is the goal of every single military in intelligence service. In fact, all these intelligence service and militaries have their own specialization. And so when we went to commerce, like what we're saying is how can we make your insurance come the way you underwrite? How can we make that to your tribal knowledge about underwriting? How can we transform this to knowledge everyone has to a knowledge only you have and with efficiencies that no one else has. So as an example on the battlefield one of the most important issues I is how do you acquire data process it and then put it into a framework where it can be actioned either from an intelligence perspective yeah so just obviously what does a business do in the end of the day what is a business doing I mean it is so for example especially in anything underwriting banking hospital intakes it's information it's information it's sorting the information in a way that you have a a distinct advantage over other people who are similarly situated uh and that that advantage can't be eviscerated easily and so de facto for what you can't what you're doing on the battlefield with our products without getting happy to is like what you're doing with ontology and foundry in some cases on the battlefield but definitely in like commercial organizations across the world but especially in America is when you approach the underwriter or the hospital we power tons and tons of hospitals right >> they have an intake problem they all have an intake problem. They all have a shortage of doctors and nurses. They are working in a low margin environment, but every single one has a different way of processing their patients according to what their specialty is and the kind of patients they don't do well with. And how do you manage that? And so the intake flow and into your enterprise in a way that you can actually process these things 10 15 times faster than you could before. >> It's January again and by now you've started making resolutions to make the new year better for you. But the smartest people are already on the road to master that one skill that matters most in 2026. AI. From just a simple text model in 2019, AI has evolved to detecting diseases, automating work, and even running tasks in your sleep. And that's why I want to introduce to you the sponsor of this video, Outskill. They are hosting a 2-day AI mastermind training session live this Saturday and Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern on both days. And right now is the perfect moment to join because you can get in absolutely free as part of the new year upskilling fest. This 16 hours AI training has already built 10 million plus AI first professionals worldwide and is rated 4.9 out of five on Trustpilot. This is where you learn how to build AI agents that plan, write, execute, and report for you. Automate workflows that even run while you sleep. Use AI to save hours every week, and get an unfair advantage at work. Not just that, you'll also learn how to profit from these skills. Seats are limited. Use the link in the description to join. >> It savees a lot of lives. Um, it also, interestingly, because you're processing the LLM in an ontology, you have a structure. It all despite what people may want to believe, it also bolster civil liberties because now you can say, well, I mean, just simple questions. Was someone processed based on economic uh considerations or were they based uh were they processed based on their background? Like those things are impossible to see unless you have like there's a huge civil liberties betterment side of this that typically people don't believe we care about or but it's actually exactly the opposite. We do care and you know showing is caring. It's like we can granularly show uh why someone came in, why they were taken, why they were rejected and we can do it in a way that makes business sense for the the business itself. Palanteer learned how to build irreplaceable competitive advantages on the battlefield and now they're applying that exact playbook to every enterprise in America. So what Karp is describing here is something most people miss about Palanteer's business model. The defense work isn't completely separate from the commercial work. It's the same thing. On the battlefield, you're acquiring data, processing it, and putting it into a framework where it can be actioned. That's literally what a hospital does with patient intake. That's literally what an insurance company does with underwriting. The stakes are different, but the problem is identical. And Alex makes this point about every enterprise wanting to become like every other enterprise. Same orchart, same tech infrastructure, same processes. That's the default gravity of business. But what you learn in military and intelligence work is that sameness has no value. The only thing that matters is whether you can do something no one else can do. So when Panteer goes into a commercial company, they're asking, \"How do we make you fundamentally different from your competitors in a way that can't be copied?\" The hospital example is really specific and worth thinking about. Every hospital has an intake problem. Every hospital has a shortage of doctors and nurses. Every hospital operates on thin margins. Those are the same problems. But every hospital also has different specialtities, different patient populations, different workflows they've developed over the years. Palunteer's approach is to take that tribal knowledge, the stuff that lives in your heads of your best people, and turn it into a system that can process patients multiple times faster. And then Alex mentions this civil liberties angle that is kind of surprising coming from a defense contractor. At least that's what you would think. But this is Palanteer. Because you're processing everything through an ontology, a structured map if you like, of how your organization actually works. You can actually answer questions you couldn't answer before. Was someone rejected because of their economic background? Was someone treated differently based on where they came from? Most organizations have no idea. They'd have to dig through thousands of records manually. Palanteer can show it granularly in real time and the business actually makes money from the same system. That's a rare case where better ethics and better economics align. So that's the translation from defense to commercial. But here's where it gets interesting. Why isn't everyone just copying this approach? In this next clip, Alex Carb explains why most AI adoption fails and why Palanteer Salesforce keeps shrinking even as the company grows faster than ever. This one's a gem. >> What is the basic hindrance in the adaption of of of the of AI? Uh is it just um legacy systems, legacy issues? What how do you how do we accelerate the adoption that it's good for humanity? >> Our adoption accelerates beyond our capacity. I think if you just buy large language models off the shelf and try to do any of this, it won't work. >> It's a commodity. It's a and well also it's not precise enough. It like you can't do underwriting with a you can't you couldn't do any of these things that are regulated. The problem with adoption at this point is people have tried things that just can never work >> like buying you borrow a large language model you put it on your stack and you wonder why you know it's like not working. And so what you're going to see especially in America is people trying to do something like what we do with ontology maybe by hand because once you build a software layer to orchestrate and manage the lounge language models in in a language that your enterprise understands you actually can create value. Like there's a lot of discussions like are we in an AI bubble? What is the meaning of the bubble? Well it's like I I think what if anything we're just in a lag where there's a lot of AI some of it works. Again, if you go back to the battlefield context, everybody in the world assumed this would not work, but now it does work. And so now the question isn't does it work, but how can we get it to work for my country? And this is exactly what's happening in companies. It's like, oh, this company it worked, mine didn't. What are you doing? >> Like for example, I mean, if you want to just make it like parochial to us, Palanteer barely has a salesforce. In fact, it seems to be getting smaller every time I go see them. And it it's not because we're trying to save on the unit economics. It's actually because it is a low trust environment in AI. People have tried lots of stuff. A lot of it hasn't worked. But if you've delivered stuff that does work, why do you need a salesforce? Like you you just >> it sells itself. >> Well, you have to say, \"Hey, don't talk to us.\" >> And then that's that's that's that's on commercial. in government at this point it's really we don't like we don't we it's it's it's very hard to export simply because we have to train the people and we have limited bandwidth >> I was going to say that's your limited bandwidth the training once somebody takes on your your software >> well in the government contest every every country like obviously has the equivalent of a security clearance right so to use our to build to build ma project maven or maven into your architecture you're going to need somebody with the highest level of clearance that also is technical and most technical people unfortunately are not going after the highest level of clearance. So there are very very few people like that. So the that that resource is super scarce. Uh and then they have to be trained and that that takes that can take a while and and and then you also have to have like anything you really have to believe in this and really think it's important and you know not everybody fits in that category. Most companies buy AI like they buy software, and that's exactly why it doesn't work for them. The problem with AI adoption right now is that people tried things that can never work. They bought a large language model off the shelf, plugged it into their existing stack, and wondered why nothing happened next. It's a commodity. It's not precise enough. You can't do regulated work like underwriting or hospital intake with raw GPT. The model doesn't understand your business, your data, your workflows, your constraints. What Palanteer builds is an orchestration layer, the ontology, which Alice Karp keeps mentioning that sits between the AI model and your actual enterprise. It translates what the AI can do into language your business understands. Without that layer, you're just playing with a chatbot. With that layer, you're actually creating value. And this is why Alex says, \"We're not in an AI bubble.\" Exactly. We're in a lag. The technology works. Palanteer's proved it on the battlefield, but most companies haven't figured out how to make it work for them yet. And the Salesforce comment was pretty great. Palanteer barely has one. That sounds like a weird flex for a software company, but think about what it means. In a low trust environment where everyone tried AI and has been burnt, the only thing that sells is results. If you've actually delivered value, if your product actually works, word spreads. customers come to you in government. Karp says they have to tell people don't talk to us because they can't handle the demand. The bottleneck becomes training and deployment. And that bottleneck is real. To deploy something like Maven, their military targeting system, you need someone with the highest security clearance who also has deep technical ability. Those people basically don't exist. Technical talent doesn't usually pursue clearances. So you have this weird constraint where demand is infinite, but the ability to fulfill it is capped by a tiny pool of qualified people. That's not a business problem most software companies have. It's actually closer to how consulting firms work. Don't get me wrong, Palanteer is not a consultant company. Let's not go down that rabbit hole again. One of the key differences is that the work product is transformational instead of just advisory. So Palanteer has this bottleneck of talent, but what does that mean for everyone else's jobs? In this final clip, Alex reveals what he thinks about AI destroying our jobs. This clip is an absolute banger. Check it out. >> You you suggested repeatedly about how AI could strengthen foundations for an economy, especially we're seeing that in the United States. Um, how rapidly can AI change the growth trajectory? because you you you mentioned that earlier about how it could improve the e economies the well-being of companies there in a lot of these things there's a speed question but um I think like with a lot of our companies it's like we can take out in the area we go in up to 80% of your cost and improve your top line dramatically but it really depends on the use case and what we're And then there's the speed function which is we can in the past 5 years ago that would take us a year. >> Sure. >> Now it could take a week. >> Week. Yeah. >> Let me further that question though. I'm sure it's on the minds of some people here. Is AI going to create jobs or destroy jobs overall? >> It Yeah. I think one of the unfortunate things of the narrative in the west is it it will destroy humanity's jobs of like you know you went to an elite school and you studied philosophy. Use myself as an example. Um >> I did too. >> Yeah. You it hopefully you have some other skill. That one is going to be hard to market. Uh and >> it was hard to market. >> It was hard to market. very hard uh with a good education, >> a very very strong education. If you can get a job, you might keep it at the heart. That's what I always thought was like if I finally get a job, I'll probably keep it and do well, but I'm not sure who's going to give me my first job. But like techn like technicians if you're a vocational technician >> or like like we're building batteries for a battery company and the people who are doing it in America are doing roughly the same job that Japanese engineers are doing and they went to high school and now they're very valuable if not irreplaceable because we can make them into something different than what they were very rapidly and those jobs are going to become more valuable. Not to diverge into my usual political screeds, but it there are will be more than enough jobs for the citizens of your nation, especially those with vocational training. I do think these these trends really do make it hard to imagine why we should have larges scale immigration unless you have a very specialized skill because >> what about the foundation for white collar work in Europe and the United States has been through the universities but I just heard you say we're going to need more vocational men and women and they may they're going to be but are you also insinuating we're probably going to need less white collar? I think like I think what we need to do is yes, but I I think we need different ways of testing aptitude. You you know there are a lot of people doing X that should be doing Y. Like if you could manage one of our system like just the person managing our maven system in the US Army is a former police officer who I think went to a junior college and they're doing very very high-end very complicated targeting globally and that person actually is irreplaceable and I think in the past the way we tested for aptitude uh would not have fully exposed how irreplaceable that person's talents are and would they been as talented if they had not gone to their college? Yes. Um and but I think the the a I tend to even inside Palunteer if you look at inside Palunteer what am I really doing all day? I'm want walking around figuring out what is someone's outlier aptitude and then I'm putting them on that thing and trying to get them to stay on that thing and not on the five other things they think they're great at. As you know, maybe for 18 years, everyone thought we were like a business joke. And now lots of business people want my advice. You know, the only people who don't want my advice at Palanteer about business are Palunteer engineers. They're like, \"Hey, Alex, I have an idea about how we could just be in a much better company.\" And it's it's always like, \"Yeah, it's like it's like literally McDonald's, but it's like we should have some titles and you should stop speaking in public.\" And uh yeah, and then I mean there's probably right about speaking in public sometimes. certainly admit that. >> I don't think you uh I don't think you did anything wrong today. >> Yeah. So, uh yeah, thank you for that high praise. >> One of the keys to success is setting the bar very low. >> Yes. No, I I don't believe that's how you uh operate palent."

        "transcript": "So, in the first clip today, we're going to see why humanoid robots are about to become a $200 billion market, and it comes down to something most people don't think about, which is demographics. Then in clip two, we have an example from CNBC when one of the analysts builds an AI powered financial dashboard in minutes with zero coding experience. And we'll talk about what that means for anyone who wants to build something but never had a technical skill to do it, which is vibe coding, which is something I've been doing a lot of recently, too. And last up, we got a bonus clip from Jensen Huang, and that one is my favorite clip of the three. >> There's the $200 billion market forecast, but you identified two or three key factors about why you now see the commercial viability. What are those factors? Hello and good morning and thanks for having me on the show. AI is indeed getting very physical and I think humanoid robots are at the forefront of this trend. But I think the reason why um the proposition is changing and why there's going to be demand for these robots is because the demographics of uh the world population is changing. The reality is that um humans are getting older. I think by 2050 uh the share of people aged above 65 is going to double. Also, humans don't really want to live in rural areas anymore. They want to be based in cities, but the factories and the manufacturing facilities are actually located outside of these cities, which creates a bit of a structural issue. And then let's not forget that um workers preferences are changing. So which means that there will be certain essential jobs yet undesirable where which might not be filled and I think this is precisely where humanoids enter the picture. I think they could be taking on these repetitive jobs this dull dirty potentially dangerous jobs augmenting productivity and um producing efficiency gains for the industry as a whole. the the main players in this field talk a lot about the labor shortage in particular in manufacturing and heavy industry. You're saying it's going to be a $200 billion uh market by 2035. Do in your research do you have any sense of how real the market is today? How many humanoids are actually out there in uh manufacturing contexts around the world in present day? The the reality is that I think that humanoid robots are no longer confined to research labs. They're stepping out of the lab and they're getting into the real economy into the real world. Um they are um a couple thousand humanoid robots already deployed on factory floors uh doing actual work in manufacturing which I think is a natural starting place because these are jobs that are more structured more easily defined. So it is the place to start for humanoids. Uh but I think this is going to change in the next five to 10 years as the technology matures and as this market picks up space. So I think I wouldn't be surprised that by 2045 when we actually project that the humanoids market is going to be as big as 200 billion dollars um that we will see tens of thousands potentially even millions of humanoid robots. It's January again and by now you've started making resolutions to make the new year better for you. But the smartest people are already on the road to master that one skill that matters most in 2026. AI. From just a simple text model in 2019, AI has evolved to detecting diseases, automating work, and even running tasks in your sleep. And that's why I want to introduce to you the sponsor of this video, Outskill. They are hosting a 2-day AI mastermind training session live this Saturday and Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern on both days. And right now is the perfect moment to join because you can get in absolutely free as part of the new year upskilling fest. This 16 hours AI training has already built 10 million plus AI first professionals worldwide and is rated 4.9 out of five on Trustpilot. This is where you learn how to build AI agents that plan, write, execute, and report for you. Automate workflows that even run while you sleep. Use AI to save hours every week, and get an unfair advantage at work. Not just that, you'll also learn how to profit from these skills. Seats are limited. Use the link in the description to join. Humanoid robots solve a workforce problem that no amount of hiring or immigration can fix. the world is running out of people willing to do essential jobs. So the demographics piece is actually one of the most important pieces of this entire conversation and it is actually something which gets overlooked when people debate whether robots are good or bad for jobs. By 2050 the share of people over 65 is going to double. Japan is already at 30%. And it's not just that people are getting older, it's that younger people don't want to work in factories anymore. They want to live in cities. They want knowledge work. They want to sit at a desk and do something on a computer. The manufacturing jobs, the warehouse jobs, the dangerous and repetitive stuff. Those positions are going unfilled right now. Tesla's been proving out this in real time with Optimus. They've got humanoids working on their own factory floors, doing pick and place tasks, taking parts from one spot and moving them to another. Sounds simple, but here's the thing. These are jobs that humans at Giga Shanghai decided they couldn't automate with a fixed robot arms. Task requires too much flexibility. You need something that can adapt to slight variations, reach awkward angles, handle unexpected situations. That's exactly what humanoid form factors are built for. And Tesla can test thousands of Optimus units internally for ever selling one to another company. They are their own first customer with millions of potential deployment positions. And the China dynamic here is fascinating, too. China's building out a massive humanoid supply chain right now. Dozens of companies, tens of billions of dollars pouring in. But there's a crucial difference between building hardware and building intelligence. You can manufacture a humanoid body, but can you train it to actually be useful in unpredictable environments? Tesla's advantage is they've been building physical AI for years with FSD. the same neural net architecture, the same training infrastructure, the same approach to realworld data collection. They're not starting from scratch on the intelligence piece. They've already solved the hard part in a different domain. And the economic math is pretty straightforward once you think it through. Minimum wage in the US hovers around 10 to 15 bucks per hour depending on the state. That's 20 to $30,000 per worker, not counting benefits, turnover costs, training, and any potential workplace injuries. If a humanoid robot can operate for a few years at a total cost well below that and it works 24 hours a day without breaks, the adoption curve is going to look vertical. We've seen this pattern before with every major technology disruption. The 1900s versus the 1913 photos of Fifth Avenue in New York are the perfect example. 13 years, that's all it took to go from horses everywhere to automobiles everywhere. the humanoid transition could happen even faster because the economic incentive is that strong. So that's the physical side of AI, robots doing work with their hands. But there's another transformation happening right now that most people haven't experienced yet. In this next clip, a CNBC reporter with zero technical background builds a working financial analyst dashboard in about 30 minutes. And what she creates, an AI that reads earning calls and tells you how evasive the CEO is being. That's genuinely useful. This is what happens when the cost of building software drops to basically zero. >> For today's tech check, dear Jerosa has been experimenting with the tools herself. Uh, and she's got plenty to show for it. Hey D. >> Hey Mike. So 30 minutes on Cloud Code. It immediately put the software selloff in context. This is truly a chat GBT like inflection moment for AI and the market is starting to hedge for it. So with just a few prompts, I was able to create something that I've always wanted reporting on the markets. So I started simply with this make a prototype that demonstrates something called an evade omter. It's an analysis tool designed to automate a gut check. So it ingests raw earnings call transcripts to quantify how direct or evasive an executive is being. This is what I got. an actual interactive dashboard ranking the last mag 7 earnings calls on evasiveness based on hedgewords deflections and other quantifiers. Now Meta Zuckerberg that got the highest score meaning the most evasive Microsoft the lowest meaning the least evasive. So this was truly a wow moment for me and potentially just as or more useful than a professional market terminal. Now Claude Co-work is only available with a Cloud Max subscription. That's a hundred bucks a month. But there's other platforms like Replet that offer something similar for free. And now it has the ability to push apps straight to the app store. A source tells me that it's nearing a new funding round that would triple its valuation to $9 billion. Now, in a nutshell, guys, that is what is scaring the software trade. The cost of building custom software, it just collapsed. The question for investors now is which companies are systems of record that stay sticky and which ones were charging for a convenience that is now being disrupted by these tools. One more example for you guys, something that I spun up this morning on Replet. This is the market jukebox right here. It is a real time dashboard that turns the S&P 500 into a dynamic playlist. I know Carl would appreciate this too. It was literally one prompt. So, as the markets they trade sideways this morning, the vibe is chill and so it's playing yacht rock. Sarah, I was going to make it Taylor Swift coded for you, but I ran out of credits, so I owe you that. But it brings up another key point. This requires just an enormous amount of compute, which may be the bullcase for the AI infrastructure buildout. >> This is what the software companies do, and this is what Ben and others have been saying why they've been selling off because it takes the cost down. Absolutely. It basically collapses the cost. So there's something among the folks that I talked to that is really key and that is like which software companies seen and I've heard workday and Salesforce the ones that have sort of been targeted in this they do have important systems of record so they can't be as easily displaced but uh someone recently told me you know a zenesk maybe that's just a nice to have and that is more you know capable of being disrupted. Um, but it just shows you I mean what I've been doing now is sort of like that's what I'm doing. I have zero coding or technical experience and I was able to whip up a number of apps in the past few weeks. So did you know our tech check producer Jasmine. Someone who can actually code can do far more and even I'll be able to do more a week from now because these tools are only going to get better. This is the worst that they're going to be right now. So you can imagine five years from now are you going to be able to v code even more important software applications? I mean the obvious answer seems yes and I think that's what's pressuring software stocks. >> Vibe coding collapses the barrier between having an idea and building the thing and that unlocks creativity from billions of people who were never part of the software economy before. So I've been using tools like Replet for a few months now and the experience is genuinely mind-blowing if you haven't tried it. I can describe what I want in plain English. Build me a dashboard that tracks these metrics and these displays or I have a business where I help people with their YouTube channels. Maybe I want to run a spell check on the video edits that my editors have made. The thing that would have cost me thousands of dollars and taken a developer weeks or months, I can prototype in an afternoon. And if I don't like something, I just tell it to change it. No back and forth and trying to explain my vision to someone who interprets everything differently. The AI actually understands what I mean. This is what's scaring the software industry right now. The cost of building custom software just completely collapsed. Think about what that means for companies like Zenesk or Salesforce or any SAS tool that charges monthly fees for something that could now be built inhouse. Some of these companies are systems of record. They've got your data, your workflow, years of history. They're probably sticky, but anything that's just a nice to have a convenience layer that's vulnerable. Why pay 50 bucks per seat per month for a tool when you can vibe code your own version for a very low price? The flip side of this, and I think this is the more interesting story, is what happens when you give creative power to people who never had it before. Three billion people use the internet who don't speak English as their first language. They've never been able to participate in software development because all the documentation, all the tools, all the communities were built for English speakers with technical backgrounds. Now they can describe what they want in their own words and AI will build it. that's bringing billions of people into the global economy as creators instead of just consumers. And the compute angle that was mentioned at the end is worth paying attention to as well. Every prompt, every code, every generation, every iteration, that's GPU cycles. The infrastructure buildout for AI isn't slowing down because these tools are only getting more popular and they're going to get better. G built a tool in 30 minutes today and someone in the future will build that in 5 minutes. The models are improving exponentially, which means the gap between I have an idea and I have a working product keeps shrinking. If you're not experimenting with these tools right now, you're falling behind people who are. And the barrier of trying them is literally just downloading an app and typing what you want to build. Now, let's take a look on what Jensen Hang said very recently about this topic. >> One of my favorite things is just vibe coding. Anybody could be a software programmer now. and and vibe coding is creating software that you know is better than a lot of software programmers. And so I love the work that cursor does. I love you I met the CEO of Loveable the other day and he's terrific guy and and a startup in Sweden and and I'm really happy to see that. And so, so I think that that AI is going to close the technology divide and everybody who who are really gifted at their craft, but maybe they don't know how to scale themselves with technology, they now have AI to help scale them. >> And so one of the stories that that the Loveable CEO was telling me is all these companies, all these people are creating basically small businesses and from the software that was written by lovable, they're making two three million dollars a year now. That's incredible. >> It is. >> And so they're welcomed into, you know, the world's economy. Um, not burdened by technology anymore because AI made that possible. And so, so I I have a feeling that that the five years from now, it is likely that we're all going to be more gainfully employed, that the economy is going to be more productive. uh hopefully the GDP actually grows uh because of the short you know overcoming the shortage the labor shortage that we have um and uh inflation will go down um you know a lot more fields of sciences are are being tackled and of course you know our technology would change a lot then but that that's the part that that's less interesting in five years time to us the computer is still a computer the applications are just smarter but they look like applications and they're still software. We're doing e-commerce. Um maybe we don't go to websites anymore, but our agents do the shopping for us, but they're still buying it from Amazon and others. Right. >> Right. >> And so I think a lot of things will probably stay the same. And then maybe maybe just one wish list is you know I wish that that um and I hope that not wish but I hope that the work that we're doing with with robotics and and humanoid robotics you know turn into something >> and and uh you know we we all have our own version of R2-D2 and C3POS's running around and >> you know they're they're cute and adorable and so I I I hope that that that happens because there are a lot of lonely people and and I actually have been approached by several that that that hopes to have um robots that they can interact with at home >> because they're living by themselves and they're getting older and uh you know and so there there are a lot of different reasons why these robots could be quite quite helpful and not not to mention they're just adorable and so that's that's an extra bonus of all the things that we're doing. One of our clients started with zero audience. Now they're doing $100,000 months thanks to YouTube. And they're not alone. We've helped three businesses hit that level just by growing them a YouTube channel. Want to see how this could work for your business? Book a call with me below."
