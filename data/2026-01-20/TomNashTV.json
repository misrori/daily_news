        "transcript": "This is an urgent warning to every single investor out there. Today's video is critical. It is important. I don't want you to click nothing. I don't want you to smash nothing. I don't want you to buy nothing. Just listen and pay attention. Now, look. Over the weekend, President Trump essentially dropped a grenade. That grenade being the announcement of new tariffs on the Europeans over the whole Greenland Rama. Now, the market took that grenade and did the only thing it can with that sort of event and basically blew everything out of proportion, painting everything red. Now, I can assure you that nothing fundamentally has changed in the business quality of the companies that comprise your portfolio. I think that's pretty much a given. What we've seen here is a political event. Now, when you have a political event meeting human psychology, you get days like today. And that's pretty normal. This how you get outsiz abnormal market reactions and the sequence is pretty much identical to what we've seen many times before and the latest was April of 2025. Nothing has changed. You have a political announcement, a political statement. It's being introduced into the world. It creates lots of uncertainty and that uncertainty gets priced in by the stock market as if it already happened and the worst possible scenario is playing out. Now, the evidence as to how bad this is and how bad it can really be is going to play out over the next few weeks, few months, maybe a couple years. And maybe it fizzles out, maybe it's nothing, maybe it's the worst thing ever. I don't know. But the market is going to price it today as if the worst possible scenario has already played out. And that is, ladies and gentlemen, how you make money in the stock market from these sort of events. You have to understand this process. Now, if you have a political drama on your hands, political hot potato like we have right now, the first thing you need to understand is these events almost never cause any pain or damage long-term to stocks. They're very impactful in the short term, but long term, these sort of events, they almost a bug on your windshield. Okay? There's always going to be a reason to sell. If you take the S&P 500 and you spread it across the last 30 years and you're going to place every huge collapse event, global collapse, geopolitical, macropolitical, you're going to have hundreds of events on that chart. And yet that chart did 800% in about 30 years. Because at the end of the day, a political event is just a conditional occurrence. It may or may not happen, but the market is always going to price it in today as if it already did. Now reality is always going to intervene and it's going to absorb some of that shock. Let me give you an example. So now we have this announcement from Trump for negotiation purposes obviously about a huge tariff. By that time that tariff is going to be implemented if at all. It's going to absorb a lot of this. Implementation usually takes a lot of this thing out of it. And by the time it's implemented most companies will find it substitution to mail it out. They'll find different suppliers, different routes, etc., etc., etc. By the time this is reality, it's almost something we even don't feel. And I just want to show you what happened in April of 2025. We had the announcement April 2025. It's almost now a year ago. The tariffs are coming and then nothing really changed because companies are just this thing mellows out, etc., etc., etc. Now, long-term long-term the stock only follows one thing that is earnings. The stock doesn't care about macro. It doesn't care about politics. If the earnings of a company are good, the stock long-term will perform. Whether it's wars, micro, it doesn't matter who's the president, who's the Fed chair, what's the interest rate, none of this matters. Earnings is the only thing that matters. If a company does well, a company's stock will do well. And experienced long-term investors understand that. That is why we spend way more money reading the balance sheets, reading the income statements rather than reading the news. Now, Peter Lynch famously said that if you spend 10 minutes on macroeconomic news in a year, you probably over spent by about 9 minutes. >> I've always said if you spend 14 minutes a year on economics, you've wasted 12 minutes. And I I I really believe that. >> Now, look, markets have this dynamic which you need to understand as an investor. They sell first, ask questions later. It's every time the same thing. Every time it's the same pattern. And I think Peter Lynch always talked about it in his different speeches and he always said, \"Look, investors always treat these events as if they mean everything and they overweigh these political macro events and they don't understand that in the grand scheme of things that matters maybe like 5%. What matters is like 95% is earnings and yet it's absolutely reversed. They trade based on micro news and political news and they give fundamentals about 5%. It's a reverse pyramid. And at the end of the day, stocks are not some abstract numbers. They're going to move based on political events. These are businesses. You own the piece of the business. If the business does well, your stock is eventually going to do well, even if it's short-term volatile. And by the way, tariffs are not new. Trump didn't invent tariffs. We have seen tariffs again and again and again, many times in the past, April, last, but even before that. The markets have always lived through these tariff events. There's nothing new about it because the big boogeyman here, the terrace are nothing more than the cost input. If your cost is X, you're now thinking, well, my cost might be X plus Y. I don't know exactly how much that Y is if this thing passes. And if it passes as it was announced, it's a big if. Now, the restraint in these sort of events when everybody's selling off, when it feels like the sky is falling, the restraint feels almost unnatural. It feels uncomfortable to just sit there and do nothing. You know, Jack Bogle famously said, you know, hurry up and do nothing, right? But as much as it feels uncomfortable in real time to not do anything in events like this, not to sell, not to panic, it really pays well. We have many examples of this in the past as a Tesla and a Palunteer shareholder. I have seen this play out many times over. We have the sequence that creates opportunity and the sequence keeps repeating itself and people refuse to learn the lesson. We have outlets operating to essentially get your attention. They overamplify these bad news to create panic or in the case of a great market euphoria. But they essentially create this false sense of reality and you have red screens, green screens, breaking news, all of this just to get your attention. And then poof, you're emotional and you're making a lot of mistakes. Now what actually moves the stock market over 10 years, 15 years as I said before is only earnings growth. And these tariffs are probably going to be meaningless for that. Governments change, Fed chair changes, president change, rhetoric changes. None of this matters in the long term for your businesses that you invested in. I don't think people understand there's a 100% correlation with what happens to a company's earnings over several years and what happens to the stock. Of course, if you're a trader, it's a whole different story, but my channel isn't for traders. It's for long-term investors. Now, while individual investors absorb headlines emotionally, professionals, institutional investors, and people who have been doing this for a while, they treat this as some sort of a no event. In fact, they don't even follow this on a daily basis. Who cares? Retail investors running out like headless chickens. The professionals are basically sitting there eating popcorn. Now, I know I know that as I'm saying this, a lot of you feel this urge. Being so calm in this sort of situation feels wrong. Tom, come on. I have to do something. No, it feels wrong exactly where it's correct. It means it's working. Doing nothing right now. I get it. It feels almost irresponsible, right? I have to do something. Everything is selling off. You have this anxiety. You have this fear. You have this pressure to act. But the biggest most important thing to do as an investor and as a good long-term investor is to override this reflex, override this impulse, and do it logically. Okay? Now, I know a lot of you will try to shoehorn yourself and pigeon hole yourself into timing the market even though you claim to be a long-term investor. Every time I have these questions about, well, how can I still time the market just a little bit, right? And I know what you're thinking. A lot of you are sitting here saying, \"Well, what about just getting out right now just for a week or two until things mellow down and I'm going to jump back in when everything just cools down.\" Now, you can do that. And of course it sounds very reasonable when you explain it like that. But there's a reason that that strategy consistently fails again and again and again in practice. And let me explain why. When you come in the eye of the storm in real time, it doesn't feel rewarding. But then you look back like Palunteer 2022 dropping from 35 to 6 and then you look at it today 170. It pays off. But it takes time. It's only hindsight. It shows you the importance of being calm. So why not just jump out for a minute and just sit it out, right? Well, the thing is with the stock market, there are a few important days in every 10 years span. And those 10 days essentially are responsible to about 50% of your returns over the next 10 years. In fact, those days are about 10 days. Okay? If you miss the best 10 days in a 10year decade, well, there's not a lot of decades that are not 10 days, but you get the point. If you miss the best 10 days in a decade, you're going to slash your returns by 50%. How would you know if one of those best 10 days doesn't happen over the next two or three weeks where you decide to sit out? You know, acting on this emotion is going to lead you to selling very very low and buying very very high every time. That's what it's designed to do. That is what professionals enjoy seeing from retail investors. This is what I try to prevent every single time. What I'm trying to teach is to stay invested through the fear, through the uncertainty, through the discomfort. If you learn this, you're going to become a better long-term investor, which means you're going to move on and graduate to stage two, where you're not only surviving this and not making any silly emotional mistakes. But now, you can use this volatility to actually make money without timing the market even once. This is the beautiful thing about long-term investing. You can use days like today to make a lot of money without timing it even once. I know it sounds paradoxal, but it is. I have a whole guide how to do that. It's called my DCA doubled down system. This guide is now yours for free. All you got to do, go to the description section of this video. The first link that appears there, you click on it, you download my guide. It's a full guide on how to use days like today to make money as a long-term investor without getting lucky, without timing the market even once. Go get it right now. It's yours. Now, here's a framework of how I would think about this particular event right now today. And this is how I do it. And every single time the market has one of these crazy red days. Number one, I'm always, always, always focus on the fundamentals. I'm going to always separate fundamentals from news. The first thing I do in a day like today is check the fundamentals of the businesses I have in my portfolio. Not so much the news, not so much the headlines, but hey, what did my company do over the past quarter? What's going on with my company? What's going on with the management? What kind of plans they have? I focus on things that matter. Then I'm always zooming out. When in doubt, zoom out. When I zoom out, I create a reality where my decisions are based on years and on decades, not on days. Because the closer you get to days, the more emotional your decisions are going to become. So, I always zoom out and I create a long-term horizon so I can eliminate emotion out of the equation. And finally, most importantly, I have an ownership mindset, which is exactly why the analogy about the farm that Warren Buffet introduced years ago is so true. If you own a farm, own the farm. Imagine for a moment that you decided to invest money now and you bought a farm and that farmer next door to you was a very peculiar character because every day that farmer with the identical farm said I'll sell you my farm or I'll buy your farm at a certain price which he would name. But just imagine if you had a farmer doing that when you bought the farm you looked to what the farm would produce. That was what went through your mind. The only thing you have to do is to remember that this guy next door is there to serve you and not to instruct you. You bought the farm because you thought the farm was uh had the potential. You don't really need a quote on it. You don't have to sell the farm at 10% of what's worth. You don't have to feel afraid about it. You still own the farm, which is exactly true for these sort of stock. By the way, this ownership mindset is literally literally the latest lecture we done in the academy just a few days ago. That lecture is now available to all my academy members. You can go right now and watch it anytime and you can join today. You can become an academy member and go and watch that lecture as well and then show up for my next lecture which is literally tomorrow and learn some new cool stuff. It's going to make you a better long-term investor. It's going to help you find stocks like Palanteer back in 2022 at $6, stocks like Nvidia 1,200% ago, stocks like Tesla back in 2019, and so forth and so forth. There's many examples. Join the academy so you can learn to be a better investor, so you can learn how to build your future, how to build generational wealth, and how to get rich slow over the long haul. That's way better in my opinion than being on the hamster wheel with all this creating stuff and the headlines and all this nonsense. That does nothing for you. It does nothing for your future financially, emotionally. It puts you in this emotional state instead of being calm, instead of being stoic and getting rich slow over the next 10, 15, 20 years. If that's something that interests you, patreon.com/domnash. Would love to see you there. Join our 28,000 members already in the academy. It's pretty insane. Let's get to 30,000. I'll see you next one. Beast."
