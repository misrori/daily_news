    "transcript": "Bitcoin  just  did  something  on  a  very  low   time  frame  that  it  hasn't  done  for  the   past  several  weeks  since  it  was  trading   above  $90,000.  And  that  means  that   currently  it  is  attempting  to  put  in  a   reversal.  Which  of  course  means  if  it's   successful  that  we  could  see  the  bottom   or  at least  a  local  bottom  being  formed   right  now.  Now,  as  I  told  you,  the  point   of  this  channel  is  now  to  be  as   extremely  objective  as  we  can  each  and   every  day.  And  on  these  market  updates,   we're  going  to  be  giving  you  the  most   important  update,  which  is  of  course  the   price  update,  which  often  reflects  the   most  objective  truth  in  the  markets,   which  is  are  there  buyers  or  are  there   sellers?  And  right  now,  what  we  can  see   is  that  for  the  first  time,  Bitcoin  has   actually  gotten  above  a  prior  15minute   candle  high.  You  can  see  this  uh  the   prior  high  was  about  68,400.   since  about  $90,000.  This  hasn't  really   happened  where  Bitcoin  was  actually   trying  to  make  it  above  these  15-minute   candles  and  then  just  started  dumping,   dumping,  dumping.  And  what  you'll  find   is  that  as  soon  as  a  local  15-minute   high  was  formed,  Bitcoin  pretty  much   hasn't  broken  it  all  the  way  down.  It's   just  lower  and  lower  and  lower.  It  does   not  go  up  on  this  15  candle  time  frame.   And  that's  partly  what's  been  so   incredibly  damning  from  this  Bitcoin   sell-off  is  there's  just  been  a   relentlessness  to  it,  a  relentlessness   to  this  sell-off.  And  as  you  can  see,  we   had  this  huge  cascade,  but  even  as  we   came  up,  we  didn't  get  above  this  prior   15-minute  level.  So,  in  my  opinion,  what   we're  seeing  here  is  actually  pretty   significant  that  we  could  get  above  this   $68,400   level.  Of  course,  I  mentioned  on   yesterday's  live  that  during  these   15-minute  highs  that  are  getting  put  in,   you  can  kind  of  easily  short  knowing   that  your  invalidation  is  very  close.  In   fact,  I  put  it  on  a  short  this  morning   just  as  we  were  tickling  this  level  and   I  put  my  stop  loss  just  above  it  and  it   stopped  out  for  a  fraction  of  a  percent.   And  that's  okay.  That's  okay  to  lose   small  when  your  chance  to  win  was   actually  pretty  significant  because  most   of  these  moves  have  been,  you  know,  4  5%   which  if  you're  using  leverage  can  be   significant  as  far  as  wins.  So,  what   we're  seeing  here  is  that  Bitcoin  needs   to  keep  this  train  rolling.  If  we  are   going  to  see  a  reversal,  we  need  to  see   it  continue  to  take  out  these  little   mini  bosses  before  we  get  to  the  first   very  big  boss,  which  is,  of  course,  this   $72,000  level.  This  was  the  source  of   the  big  breakdown.  And  really,  this   marked  the  bottom  of  that  very   significant  range  that  we  established   from  the  prior  high  when  we  first  had   the  Bitcoin  ETF  go  live  back  in  March  of   2024.  It  also  marked  the  ultimate  low  of   Trump's  initial  tariff  scare  in  the   spring  of  2025.  So  getting  above  this   area  between  72  and  74K,  that  is  by  far   the  biggest  area  to  get  over  before  we   should  really  start  getting  incredibly   bullish.  But  I  wanted  to  point  this  out   because  on  a  low  time  frame,  we've  seen   Bitcoin  finally  finally  break  out  of   this  just  crushing  downward  spiral  that   it's  been  in,  like  I  said,  with  one   cascade  here,  but  it's  been  in  this  all   the  way  up  to  the  $90,000  territory.  So   this  is  a  massive  step  forward,  at least   for  Bitcoin,  bucking  the  initial  trend.   It  doesn't  mean  much  yet  because  I  would   say  that  if  you  zoom  out,  we're  now   probably  going  to  be  in  this  weekly   range  for  a  while.  And  that  could  be   pretty  good  because  what  we've  seen  is   that  in  most  bare  markets,  and  it's   undeniable  at  this  point  that  we're  not   in  a  bare  market.  We  are  definitely  in  a   bare  market,  but  in  most  bare  markets,   there's  usually  significant  rallies  or   bounces  at least  out  of  crypto  assets.   We  usually  see  things  bounce  really   aggressively.  And  in  the  case  of  this   bare  market,  we  have  not  seen  that.  we   have  seen  pretty  much  a  an  orderly   sell-off  from  the  highs.  And  so  if  we   end  up  in  this  new  weekly  range,  which  I   would  say  the  low  right  now  is  60  and   the  high  is  this  prior  wick  support  here   around  80,  that  is  your  range.  And  so  we   might  bounce  around  here,  but  at least   there's  a  chance  here  for  some  serious   bounces  and  serious  rallies.  So  long  as   we  stay  above  this  $60,000  level,  I   would  imagine  that  we  at  least  get  a   little  bit  of  calm  here,  if  not  a  mean   reversion  rally.  And  your  key  to  knowing   if  this  doesn't  hold,  the  first  sign   will  be  falling  below  this  64  $65,000   local  low.  That  would  be  a  sign  that  new   weakness  is  forming.  And  then  of  course   confirming  below  the  $60,000  level.  That   would  mean  we're  seeing  a  whole  another   leg  to  the  bare  market.  And  that  would   be  probably  where  we  start  to  make  our   ways,  I  would  think,  towards  at least   significantly  closer  towards  our   ultimate  lows.  But  within  this  range,   it's  possible  that  we  see  deviations.  Uh   but  I  wouldn't  be  surprised  to  see  us   kind  of  chop  around  here  for  at  least  a   few  weeks,  if  not  a  month  or  two.  That   wouldn't  be  surprising  to  me  at  all   because  we've  seen  so  many  fireworks   from  the  prior  high  of  126,000  all  the   way  down  to  60,000.  That's  over  a  50%   drop  in  just  a  few  weeks.  That  to  me  is   enough  violence  for  now.  But  I  wanted  to   go  over  this  because  there's  actually   other  things  going  on  in  the  markets   today.  But  the  first  day  in  a  long  time,   not  everything  is  blood  red  on  the   dashboard  here.  Bitcoin  with  a  nice   little  bounce.  ETH  back  above  2K.  Soul   doing  okay  back  above  80.  But  really   what  I  want  to  point  out  to  you  is  gold.   Gold  to  me  is  the  most  interesting  chart   here  because  if  we  go  to  our  trade   setups,  you  can  see  that  it's  actually   bouncing  right  near  a  critical  support.   And  you  can  see  here  that  the  gold  chart   is  actually  trying  to  get  above  this   $5,100  level.  And  you  can  see  almost  a   nice  pattern  of  higher  lows  and  higher   highs  being  formed  here.  Obviously,  it   needs  to  get  above  this  5100  before  it   becomes  really  interesting.  But  it's   unclear  to  me  whether  gold  is  just  about   to  roll  over  and  die.  Again,  I'm  flat  on   gold  right  now,  but  I'm  going  to  get   very  interested  if  it's  able  to  get   above  that  $5,100  price  point.  I'm  going   to  be  getting  significant  exposure  cuz   it  looks  like  there's  another  leg  or  at   least  a  retest  of  that  high  on  the  cards   for  the  shiniest  of  all  rocks.  Now,  I   think  we  should  talk  about  something   else,  which  is  that  we  have  evidence   today  of  the  economy  reacelerating.  And   I  think  that  this  is  a  very,  very   important  point  because  that  brings  in   other  trades  into  the  equation.   Remember,  the  point  of  this  channel  is   to  make  the  most  money  possible.  And  as   I've  said  over  the  last  few  episodes,  I   am  interested  obviously  in  buying  the   ultimate  lows  here  in  bare  market  town   in  crypto.  But  I  have  come  to  terms  with   the  fact  that  there  are  a  lot  of  reasons   why  crypto  isn't  pumping  right  now.   There's  a  lot  of  FUD.  There's  a  lot  of   uncertainty.  And  quite  frankly,  there's   a  lot  of  other  sectors  in  the  economy   that  are  pulling  marginal  speculative   dollars  away  from  crypto.  And  to  be  very   clear,  those  are  AI,  robotics,  and  the   energy,  the  bottlenecks  that  are   powering  these  new  emerging  fields.   Those  are  very  very  exciting,  very   interesting.  And  if  you've  been  playing   with  them  at  all,  you'll  know  that  they   are  absolutely  mind-blowing  in  what  they   are  capable  of.  They  are  delivering  the   value  that  they  had  said  on  the  10.  And   that  is  what  I  am  excited  about  about   these  new  emerging  frontier  tech  fields.   Something  that  I  think  crypto  will   eventually  come  to  do,  but  right  now  it   is  struggling  to  do.  The  point  of  this   channel  is  to  seek  truth,  is  to  make  the   most  money  possible.  And  that  means  we   must  be  paying  attention.  And  so  why  am   I  telling  you  this?  because  there's  one   trade  that  has  come  into  clear  view  over   the  last  few  days  and  weeks.  Something   I've  been  highlighting  periodically,  but   there's  a  new  data  point  that  actually   supports  this  worldview  and  I  wanted  to   show  it  to  you.  Here's  Fijiao.  He's  uh   if  you  guys  aren't  following  him,  please   do.  Uh  Fhiao  Inc.  He  is  just  an   incredible  macro  analyst  here.  Go  ahead   and  gas  him  up  on  this  tweet  because   he's  essentially  saying  that  the  economy   is  reacelerating.  In  specific,  he's   highlighting  that  there's  been  a   bottoming  and  a  reversal  on  non-farm   payrolls.  And  you  can  see  that  this   downtrend  has  been  in  effect  since  2022.   So  this  is  a  big  change.  It  shows  that   the  end  of  quantitative  tightening  is   also  transitioning  into  a  period  of   expansion.  Now,  as  you  know,  we've  been   talking  about  ISM  on  this  channel  for   quite  a  while,  and  that  finally  broke   above  the  hallowed  50  mark,  which  is  of   course  the  sign  of  an  accelerating   economy.  We  can  see  that  the  recent  uh   monthly  data  output  was  52.6,  which  is  a   huge  uptick  and  a  great  sign  for  those   who  are  looking  for  economic  recovery.   So,  you  combine  these  two  pieces  of   data,  the  non-farm  payrolls  and  the   uptick  in  ISM.  And  Felix  here  did  the   numbers.  You  should  check  out  his   Forward  Guidance  podcast,  but  he  showed   that  copper  miners  are  effectively  when   you  combine  these  two  pieces  of  data,   looking  out  a  12-month  time  period,   copper  miners  are  the  biggest   beneficiaries  of  this  combination  of   data.  Now,  if  you  remember,  we've  been   heavily  looking  at  copper  as  an  asset   over  the  last  few  weeks  and  months   because  copper  is  the  next  best  metal   for  conductivity  in  producing  renewable   energies.  It's  also  hugely  important  for   military  equipment  and  building  weapons.   And  as  you  can  see,  the  long-term  copper   chart  is  very,  very  bullish.  You  can  see   here  since  2020,  it's  just  been  kind  of   grinding  up  against  this  uh  sort  of   diagonal  yellow.  And  it  even  broke  out   for  a  second  here.  It  didn't  quite  make   it  out.  But  what  I  actually  like  is   looking  at  large-scale  copper  miners,   copper  producers.  And  what  you'll  see  is   that  this  is  a  prior  high  on  FCX,   Freeport  McMoran,  which  is  a  stock  that   I  do  own  in  pretty  significant  size   here.  I'm  betting  heavily  on  copper  as  a   beneficiary  of  the  AI  and  robotics   movement  we're  about  to  see,  as  well  as   a  reaceleration  of  the  economy.  As  the   economy  does  better,  copper  tends  to  do   well.  And  so  you  have  a  lot  of  factors   here  that  should  influence  copper  doing   very  well.  Now,  if  you  look  at  FCX,  what   you'll  see  is  that  this  was  a  prior   all-time  high  here  of  about  $63  or  so.   And  that  was  formed  in  2008,  right   before  the  Pico  top  of  the  financial   crisis.  And  what  you'll  see  here  is  that   we  are  literally  running  our  heads  right   up  against  it.  There  was  a  bit  of  a   rejection  here,  a  failure  here,  but  it   didn't  break  down  below  key  levels,  and   it  looks  like  FCX  is  trying  to  get  above   this  again.  So,  I'm  still  holding  this   FCX  position.  It  looks  as  though  copper   is  going  to  be  a  good  place  to  do   business  here  for  the  next  few  months,   maybe  even  a  year  or  two.  I'm  not  sure.   But  I'm  going  to  be  riding  this  trade.   And  each  and  every  day,  I'm  going  to  be   doing  my  best  to  bring  you  the  best   trades  that  I  can.  And  let's  try  to  make   some  money,  guys.  Let's  try  to  make  the   most  amount  of  money  possible  so  that   when  the  bare  market  lows  hit  for   Bitcoin,  we'll  be  ready  to  buy  it  by  the   truckload.  In  altcoin  news,  as  far  as   altcoins  that  I'm  going to  be  watching   throughout  the  bare  market,  we  have  ZRO.   It's  the  crosschain  messaging   application  called  Layer  Zero.  They  have   a  crosschain  bridge  called  Stargate  and   effectively  they're  doing,  you  know,  a   new  system  of  buybacks  and  they  just   launched  their  own  chain.  They  just   announced  their  own  chain  which   apparently  has  a  lot  of  technical  chops.   Uh,  in  the  end,  this  is  starting  to  look   like  it  might  be  forming  a  bit  of  a   durable  bottom.  It  could  take  quite  a   bit  of  time  here,  but  this  is  something   to  keep  your  eyes  on  for  at  least  the   next  few  months.  Something  that  I'm   planning  to  accumulate  very  slowly  once   the  bottoming  formation  on  Bitcoin   starts  to  become  more  apparent.  So,  this   is  just  something  I  want  on  your  radar.   Nothing  too  actionable  right  now.  Just   something  to  consider.  Finally,  let's   talk  a  little  bit  about  some  AI  and   robotics  news.  This  is  something  that  I   think  we  should  all  be  aware  of  because   this  is  the  most  pressing  investment   frontier  of  our  time.  Crypto  has  been  on   the  bleeding  edge  of  investing  and  risk   assets  for  the  past  16  years.  I  believe   that  it  will  continue  to  find  its  role   within  the  frontier  of  investment.  But   right  now,  undeniably,  AI  and  robotics   are  driving  absolutely  everything  as  far   as  real  change  in  the  economy  today.  So   it's  important  that  we  understand  and   analyze  these  on  the  channel  regularly.   So  what  does  this  mean?  And  by  the  way,   these  are  huge  companies,  hundred   billion  dollar,  trillion  dollar   companies.  These  are  not  altcoins.  I  do   not  have  any  special  ownership  of  these   coins,  right?  I  see  some  of  the  comments   in  the  comment  section.  No,  the  point  of   this  channel  has  to  be  to  cover  the  most   valuable  investment  opportunities,   whether  they're  in  crypto  or  whether   they're  beyond  crypto.  And  that's  why  we   have  to  talk  about  this  stuff.  More   importantly,  what's  very  toxic  I  find  is   that  the  most  valuable  wealth  creation   opportunities  are  not  available  to   everyone.  This  is  something  that   absolutely  must  change  because  you  have   OpenAI  being  valued  at  800  billion,   almost  a  trillion,  anthropic,  you  know,   Claude  Opus  at  380  billion,  SpaceX  at   1.25  trillion,  and  most  investors  in  the   world  are  unable  to  participate.  And  as   Will  says  here,  he  fully  understands   there  needs  to  be  some  investor   protection  laws  in  place.  But  Americans   with  retirement  accounts,  they  do  have   some  indirect  exposure  here.  But  imagine   if  this  value  creation  directly   benefited  everyday  people,  which  it  does   not  right  now.  And  that's  a  problem.   That's  a  significant  flaw  in  the  system.   So  this  is  a  huge,  in  my  opinion,   structural  issue.  I  said  under  here,  I   said  there  should  be  some  simple  rules   such  as  if  the  round  is  over  a  billion   dollars  and  then  a  few  other  pieces  of   disclosure  are  present,  anyone  can  bid.   That  would  be  a  way  that  essentially  if   there's  a  private  market  company  and  it   gets  a  valuation  over  a  certain  amount,   then  it  should  be  public  or  available  at   least  for  the  founders  to  take  in  money   from  anybody.  They  shouldn't  have  to   pass  all  of  these  regulatory   requirements  that  effectively  stipulate   for  them  to  be  accredited  investors  or   already  rich,  right?  Cuz  I  bet  a  lot  of   you  would  have  bought  right  into  chat   GBT  if  you  could  have  when  it  launched   in  2022  and  you'd  be  up  probably  50x  or   something  crazy.  Speaking  of  buying  in   early,  this  dude  SBF  would  have  been  up   astronomical  if  he  didn't  get  wiped  from   the  board.  If  he  didn't  get  put  into   bankruptcy  by  CZ  creating  the  bank  run,   he  would  have  been  up  so  huge.  His   estimated  portfolio  total  would  have   been  $136   billion.   Absolutely  insane.  Absolutely  insane.   Just  look  at  the  anthropic  shares  alone   would  have  been  $30  billion  of  that.   Robin  Hood  alone  would  have  been  almost   $8  billion.  It  just  is  insane.  This  guy   was  actually,  despite  all  of  his  flaws,   would  have  been  one  of the  most  prolific   investors  in  the  history  of  early  stage   investing.  That  is  actually  insane  and   mind-boggling  and  a  bit  scary.  And  maybe   it  shows  how  insane  you  have  to  be  to   kind  of  put  this  money  into  early  stage   investments.  Of  course,  some  of  that   money  was  literally  stolen,  not  his,  but   that's  not  the  point.  The  point  is,  if   he  didn't  get  wiped  from  the  board  when   he  did,  he  would  be  in  this  unstoppable   position  of  power  with  hundreds  of   billions  of  dollars  at  his  disposal  to   influence  government,  the  world.  So,  I   think  we  should  all  be  thankful  that  he   got  wiped  from  the  board  when  he  did,   but  also  understand  that  the  dude  wasn't   completely  wrong  about  everything,  but   also  understand  that  this  dude  was  on   track  to  actually  making  some  of  the   biggest  moves  in  history.  He  just  got   greedy,  overzealous,  and  started   stealing  customer  funds.  a  completely   unethical  way  to  run  your  business  and  a   surefire  way  to  get  white  from  the   board,  but  still  honestly  insane  when   you  look  at  what's  happened  with  the  AI   investment  landscape.  I  would  imagine   that  he  would  have  been  the  biggest   holder  of  Anthropic  or  FTX  would  have   been  the  biggest  holder  of  Anthropic,   which  is  an  AI  that  I  use  regularly.   It's  my  favorite  AI  model.  I  know  I   should  be  using  more  of  them.  That's  the   other  thing.  I'm  not  as  good  at   switching  between  AI  models,  but  I'll   get  there.  I'll  get  there.  Okay.  Make   sure  to  follow  me  on  Twitter.  We're   going to  be  having  some  huge  updates  and   giveaways  for  Supernova,  which  in  this   rangebound  probably  period  of  some  calm.   I  think  it's  a  good  environment  for   something  like  Supernova  to  take  a  crack   at  getting  a  foothold  on  Ethereum.  So,   make  sure  you  follow  these  socials  over   there  if  you  want  to  get  some  free   goodies,  some  free  Venova  tokens.   Hopefully,  it'll  make  the  bare  market   just  a  little  bit  easier  on  all  of  you.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin újra megpróbálja elérni a fordulópontot, mivel sikerült átlépnie egy korábbi 15 perces gyertya magasságát, amely 68,400 dollár körül volt. Az elmúlt hetek eladási nyomásához képest ez jelentős lépés, amit a piaci hangulat is pozitívan tükröz. Az előző maximumok 90,000 dollár körül voltak, és a jövőbeni emelkedés kulcsfontosságú szintje a 72,000 dollár lehet. Jelenleg a Bitcoin a 60,000–80,000 dolláros tartományban mozoghat, amely lehetőséget adhat komolyabb emelkedésekre. Az elemző figyelmeztetett, hogy ha a Bitcoin a 64,000–65,000 dolláros szint alá esik, az újabb gyengeséget jelezhet. Emellett utalt arra is, hogy az AI és robotika területei is érdekes befektetési lehetőségeket kínálnak, amelyek elvonhatják a figyelmet a kriptovalutáktól.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin is attempting a reversal by breaking above a previous 15-minute candle high at around 68,400 dollars, a significant step compared to the relentless selling pressure seen in recent weeks. With prior highs hovering near 90,000 dollars, a key resistance level for future upward movement is at 72,000 dollars. Currently, Bitcoin is in the 60,000-80,000 dollar range, which could allow for substantial rallies. The analyst cautioned that falling below the 64,000-65,000 dollar mark could signify new weakness. Additionally, he highlighted potential investment opportunities in AI and robotics that might divert funds from cryptocurrencies.",
