    "transcript": "clicking  the  button.  Oh  yes.  Oh  yes.  Oh   yes.  Oh  yes.  Guys,  welcome  to  yet   another  episode.  And  as  you  can  see   right  now,  Bitcoin  is  currently  in  a   position  where  it's  right  above  the  buy   zone.  And  overall,  the  market  is   signaling  us  that  it  wants  more  pain.   The  way  to  read  the  chart  right  now  is   more  pain.  Why?  Because  we  have  no   bounce.  We  haven't  even  tried  to  get   above  this  74K  level,  which  is  the  lows   from  the  last  year.  I  mean,  think  about   it.  Bitcoin  currently  has  not  even  tried   to  touch  it.  not  even  break  it,  just  pet   it.  It  could  not  even  pet  it,  which   means  that  the  bulls  are  still  not   showing  initiative.  When  the  bulls  are   not  showing  initiative,  the  path  of   least  resistance  is  down  because  we  have   a  bare  trend.  The  chart,  the  chart  is   ugly  for  the  bulls.  I  mean,  for  the   bells,  for  the  bears,  it's  quite  nice.   And  we  are  heading  straight  for  the  buy   zone,  which  is  fantastic  if  you  think   about  it  because  at  the  end  of  the  day,   if  you  can  buy  Bitcoin  cheap  right  here   in  the  buy  zone,  fantastic.  But   long-term  is  great.  It's  discount.  Think   of  it  positively.  I  want  to  bring  some   positivity  into  your  life  here  because   this  is  a  chance  for  the  average  plebbit   to  buy  Bitcoin  again.  Institutions  are   here.  ETFs,  Black  Rockck,  Schmacro,   everyone  is  here.  Everyone  is  here.  And   so  this  maybe  is  the  last  chance  for  the   average  playbook  to  get  Bitcoin  below   50K  in  the  coming  months.  Below  60K,  I   think  we're  going  to  be  there  quite   quick  if  we  go  into  the  buy  zone,  but   below  50K,  maybe  even  at  40K.  If  you   look  at  how  far  average  midterm  years   fall,  uh  it  is  approximately  60%,   between  60  and  um  uh  50  and  60%.  Let  me   bring  it  up  right  here.  And  so  if  we   fall  this  year  uh  like  we've  been   following  the  previous  midterm  years,  I   mean  we  can  easily  get  into  those  uh   ranges  basically,  you  know,  40ish  uh  and   um  yeah,  it  would  be  approximately  minus   65%  down  for  the  year.  We  fell  already   25%  this  year.  So  if  we  keep  tracking   this  midterm  year  chart  which  we   currently  do  exact  don't  be  surprised  if   we  get  to  buy  here  in  the  buy  zone  at   quite  good  levels.  I  mean  here  at  ports   it  would  be  fantastic.  So  all  in  all   this  is  good.  It's  not  bad.  It's  not   bad.  It's  bad  only  if  you  are  in  a  bad   position  and  you  are  worrying  and  this   and  that.  It's  very  very  good  if  you've   been  risk  since  October.  But  even  if  you   just  hodddle  huddle  huddle  uh  it's  okay.   And  if  you  are  trading  this  this  is   fantastic.  I  mean  guys  we're  eating  now.   Our  community  is  eating  like  there  is  no   tomorrow.  This  is  from  bull  mania   discord  from  um  uh  yesterday.  You  have   all  kinds  of  shorting  going  on.  All   kinds  of  shorting.  And  why  can  we  short?   Like  why  can  these  people  short  20x  40x?   Because  they  have  the  mechanical  rules.   They're  not  risking  a  lot  because  every   time  you  short,  every  time  you  long,   every  time  you  do  any  position,  first   you  do  risk  calculation  according  to   mechanical  rules.  Then  you  do  position   sizing  according  to  mechanical  rules.   You  have  entry  strategy  and  exit   strategy.  All  of  that  is  part  of  the   mechanical  rules.  But  anyway,  293%   short.  Uh  235%  short.  Uh  you  have  uh  is   John  50%  short.  Everything  is  short.  I   mean  look  here  everything  is  short.  The   only  people  eating  now  are  short.  This   guy  Jason  sharing  gain  126%.  Fantastic   short.  Uh  this  guy  Jacob  sharing  gain   20%  short.  Uh  you  have  this  guy   shorting  NYX  getting  green  short.  So   still  I  can  tell  you  based  on  our   community  it's  only  shorting  that  works.   Now  for  making  money  right  now  in  this   market  only  only  shorting.  What  do  you   short?  You  short  whatever  is  entering  a   new  bare  trend.  How  you  do  it?  You  can   do  it  quite  easily  if  you  have  the  money   scanner.  If  you  are  in  bulmania  you  come   here.  You  see  what  flipped  bearish  in   the  last  week  for  example  here  and  you   remove  everything  that's  bullish  and  you   have  here  all  kinds  of  coins  that   recently  flipped  bearish.  Some  of  them   haven't  even  started  to  dump  yet,  but   you  can  start  going  nuts  here.  And  of   course,  you  can  see  if  you  have  the  bull   man,  you  can  go  see  in  real  time  what's   been  bullish  like  right  now,  today,  and   so  on  and  so  forth.  So,  that's  the   playbook.  That's  the  playbook.  You  don't   have  to  be  miserable.  You  don't  have  to   just  cry  that  your  coin  is  down,  that   you  did  not  sell.  You  should  have  a   plan.  You  should  have  a  plan.  Very,  very   important  to  have  a  plan.  And  so,  more   pain  is  coming  for  Bitcoin  for  sure.  For   sure.  Like  Macron  would  have  said,  for   sure.  Um,  at  least  to  touch  the  200WE   moving  average.  Maybe  it  will  get  a   bounce.  I  mean  200  week  moving  average   could  be  bouncy.  Okay,  we  could  get  a   bit  of  bouncy  castle  here.  Maybe  back   towards  the  74  for  all  coins  guys.   Everything  is  sliding  down.  Uh  Sana  is   sliding  towards  the  magnets  at  30.  I   keep  repeating  it  every  day  but  I  think   it's  quite  important  to  demonstrate  that   there  is  no  support.  I  mean  there  is   nothing  here.  There's  nothing  here.  So   if  we  get  more  and  more  down  here   towards  you  know  the  50s  the  40s  um  yeah   the  next  up  is  going  to  be  30.   [laughter]  Okay.  So  sold  to  30  BNB.   What's  BNB  doing?  BNB  is  coming  closer   and  closer  to  its  target  here.  If  it   loses  this  one,  you  have  the  new  target   at  350.  350  is  going  to  go  to.  Guys,   when  it  comes  to  gold,  you  have  to  be  a   bit  careful  when  it  comes  to  gold  in   case  this  deal  goes  through.  US  and   Russia  are  doing  a  deal  now  uh  with  uh   the  dollar.  Basically,  it's  not   confirmed  yet.  I  mean  let's  see  if  it   will  be  confirmed  but  there  is   potentially  a  deal  between  US  and  Russia   to  bring  Russia  back  into  the  world   economy  and  they  will  be  using  the   dollar  no  more  bricks.  What  have  what   have  I  been  saying  to  you  on  this   channel?  Bricks  is  mainly  for  guys.  I   mean  as  a  concept  it's  mainly  a  fori   because  all  of  these  different  bricks   countries  they're  not  really  aligned.   They  don't  really  support  each  other.   Look  at  China.  They  don't  bank  Russian   companies.  You  you're  a  Russian  company   you  try  to  sell  a  bit  of  oil,  a  bit  of   gas,  China  will  not  touch  you.  I  mean  in   a  legit  way  they  want  they  will  try  to   you  know  get  you  in  abuse  you  basically   get  your  oil  basically  for  free  so  it's   not  you  know  relationship  on  equals  and   China  is  very  careful  not  to  get  uh  on  a   bad  foot  with  with  the  US  so  it's  not   like  an  economic  block  okay  it's  not  an   economic  block  not  at  all  not  at  all  far   from  it  and  as  soon  as  Trump  throws  a   bone  here  okay  let's  make  a  deal  now   suddenly  bam  let's  have  Russia  use  the   dollar  let's  get  back  in  I  mean  think  to   yourself.  Russia,  is  it  better  to  be   reintegrated  back,  make  some  deal  with   Trump  or  not?  So,  let's  see  what's  going   to  happen.  But  this  brick  stuff,  it  is   mainly  a  marketing  thing.  Likely,  they   will  never  have  some  kind  of  currency.   Likely,  I  mean,  you  never  say  never.  I'm   happy  to  change  my  mind  if  we  see  more   signs  towards  it.  But  mainly,  it's  a   marketing  thing.  It's  I  mean,  the   countries,  if  you  look  at  countries   individually,  obviously  China  is   massive.  China  a  fantastic  economic   power.  But  I'm  not  speaking  about  that.   I'm  speaking  overall  as  this  you  know   some  kind  of  brotherly  collaboration   between  aligned  nations  sharing  currency   sharing  there  there  is  none  of  that   there  is  actually  quite  zero  of  that  so   let's  see  what's  going  to  happen  here   but  all  in  all  if  Russia  and  the  US  do  a   deal  the  gold  trade  will  have  its  uh   pullback  towards  the  50we  moving  average   could  be  easily  you  know  [laughter]   could  easily  go  to  50  moving  average  and   let's  see  what's  going  to  happen  here   but  there's  a  lot  of  volatility  market   is  trying  to  figure  out  what's  going  to   do  but  if  this  narrative  with  you  know   some  kind  of  goldbacked  bricks  dollar   killer  which  is  a  it's  a  fairy  tale   anyway  but  if  it  also  goes  away  from  the   news  cycle  then  buying  here  at  50  week   is  going  to  be  fantastic  for  gold  and  I   mean  once  gold  goes  to  50  week  times  it   also  goes  below  so  let's  see  what's   going  to  happen  but  look  out  for   long-term  accumulation  in  this  kind  of   buy  zone  I  mean  between  50  week  and  uh   200  week  okay  this  is  the  buy  zone  for   gold  uh  silver  the  same  the  same  Silver   is  the  same.  The  buy  zone  for  silver  is   right  here  between  this  moving  averages.   Okay,  this  is  the  buy  zone  for  silver.   It's  going  to  beop  derping  down  here  in   the  coming  weeks  and  months.  So,  keep  an   eye  there.  Uh  platinum,  platinum,   platinum.  The  same  thing  here.  It's  it   has  a  very  nice  buy  zone  here  between   the  moving  averages.  Fantastic.   Fantastic.  So,  just  keep  an  eye  there.   Um  looking  at  other  alts,  we  see  I  mean   we  check  Avox  like  every  time  it  goes  to   alltime  low  every  time  this.  Let's  see   which  which  don't  we  check  so  much.   Let's  check  to  what's  happening  there.   And  you  guys  can  let  me  know  in  the   comment  section  which  ones  you  want  me   to  check  here  uh  on  the  show.  Tao  going   to  alltime  low.  Uh  AI  for  guys  is  not   working.  And  yeah,  it's  price  discovery   since  bare  trend.  You  have  to  be  very   careful  with  bear  trend  and  it  just  goes   lower  and  lower.  Ada  add  still  on  this   levels.  Boop  boop  boop  boop.  It  has  a   stairs  formation  down  here.  So  don't  get   surprised  if  it  takes  all  of  that.  Uh   dot  what's  happening  dot.  Oh  my  god.   Yeah.  Yeah.  It's  alltime  low.  Oh,  it's   price  discovery.  Each  week  it's  red.   Every  week  it's  red.  And  it's  funny   sometimes  people  are  saying,  \"Hey,  we   had  so  many  red  weeks.  Next  one  must  be   a  green  week.\"  Have  you  have  you  heard   that?  And  I  mean,  if  you  know  about  uh   probabilities,  you  know  about   statistics,  you  know  that  it's  for  guys.   Like  when  you  roll  a  dice,  if  you  have,   you  know,  five  sixes  in  a  row,  it   doesn't  necessarily  change  the   probability  of  the  next  six  that  you   roll  the  next  six.  I  mean,  if  you  if   you're  educated  at  play,  you  understand   it.  If  you've  done  a  bit  of  like   probability  study,  you've  done  a  bit  of   math,  you  understand  that,  you  know,  you   roll  six  sixes  in  a  row,  next  one   doesn't  necessarily  have  any  other   chance  uh  that  is  different  from  the   previous  ones  to  also  get  a  six.  So,   it's  the  same  the  same  thing  is  here.   Listen,  I  mean,  yes,  it's  been  many  a   lot  of  down,  but  they  take  it  one  week   at  a  time,  guys.  Like,  what  each  and   every  week  is  kind  of  independent  here.   So,  you  can  easily  have  another  10  weeks   down  uh  red.  Will  it  have  a  green  week   at  some  point?  I  mean  likely  at  some   point  is  going  to  have  a  green  week  but   in  a  such  a  brutal  bare  trend  without   any  meaningful  relief  rally  is  just   getting  smashed.  Okay,  smashed  bigly   bigly  bigly.  Let's  check  a  someone  asked   for  a  let's  check  a  what's  happening  a   we  now  have  uh  guys  it  looks  bad.  This   looks  bad.  It's  it's  below  this  moving   average.  below  this  below  this  uh  falls   towards  its  um  I  mean  let  me  actually   draw  like  a  buy  area  here  uh  if  you  want   to  buy  it  I  mean  that's  another  question   do  you  want  to  buy  um  I  mean  somewhere   here  it  has  a  bit  of  a  support  but  guys   it  can  easily  break  it  also  it  can  go  to   60  and  and  go  below  but  it  has   technically  a  support  here  from  the  last   bare  market  lows  you  can  say  it's  quite   an  established  support  if  it  goes  here   and  you  really  love  ABA  you  could  buy  a   bit  but  I  mean  ideally  wait  for  the  bull   trend  is  you  saw  with  the  polka  dot.   Polka  dot  went  below  previous  alltime   low  and  just  down  and  down  and  down  and   down  and  down  and  down.  I  what  I  would   do  instead  here  guys  is  if  you  have  the   mechanical  rules  you  could  even  short   like  if  you're  part  of  bull  mania  you   you  could  even  try  shorting  it  because   it  has  a  clear  target  here.  Not  with  too   much  too  much  leverage  because  we  are  on   a  weekly  weekly  time  frame.  So  it  could   still  have  uh  rebounds  that  look  small   on  weekly  but  on  daily  they  can  be   significant.  And  all  in  all  the  big   target  here  is  still  yeah  it's  still   here  somewhere  60  50  don't  be  surprised   if  it  gets  here  um  and  if  it  doesn't   bounce  here  holy  crap  then  it's  price   discovery  well  it  has  alltime  low  here   at  like  30   so  that's  how  it  looks  looks  like  right   now  I  don't  want  to  sugarcoat  it  I  mean   it's  uh  it's  bleeding  it's  bleeding  very   very  very  very  quickly  going  going  to   Dagistan  like  people  saying  two  three   year  Dagistan  well  I  mean  to  be  fair   it's  been  now  many  years  in  Dagistan  for   many  coins  Iota  time.  What's  happening?   I  alltime  low.  Holy  crap.  Yeah,  not  not   too  Oh,  actually  not  fully  alltime  low,   guys.  It  had  a  week  here  in  2020.  Let's   [snorts]  see  if  it  can  hold  out.  But  uh   yeah,  I  mean  this  what  I  mean.  All  coins   are  brutal.  Brutal.  Brutal.  Brutal.   Brutal.  Brutal.  Brutal.  Brutal.  In  bare   trend.  You  don't  want  to  touch  them.  You   don't  want  to  give  them  benefit  of  the   doubt.  You  don't  care  about   fundamentals.  You  avoid  them  like  fire.   Like  fire.  Or  how  do  or  what  do  you   mean?  Maybe  fire  is  good.  You  need  fire   to  warm  yourself.  This  is  where  you   avoid  them  like  plague.  Okay.  like   plague,  like  the  disease,  disaster.   That's  why  when  we  derisk  on  October   8th,  no  more  alts.  No  more  alts.  If   Bitcoin  is  not  showing  strength,  we're   out.  Guys,  if  you  are  in  Netherlands,   big  shout  out  to  Guzman.  Holy  crap,   you're  in  a  bad  position.  36%  unrealized   gain  tax  just  passed  the  Dutch  House  of   Representative.  I  I  mean,  guys,   I  don't  know  what  to  say.  I  don't  know   where  to  begin.  I  don't  know  how  to  even   start  telling  it.  But  the  productive   people  who  have  assets,  they're  now   forced  to  pay  for  everything  that's   happening  in  the  country.  You  know  what?   There's  a  lot  of  things  happening  in  the   country.  Not  only  Netherlands,  I  mean   the  same  is  in  France,  the  same  is  in   all  western  countries.  I  don't  want  to   speak  too  much  about  it,  but  you  know   what  it  is  like  there  is  a  lot  there   there  there  is  a  lot  to  pay  for.  Okay?   And  many  smart  people  with  a  brain,   they're  living.  If  you  have  a  brain,   you're  leaving.  Like  Guzman  now,  he's   trying  to  figure  out  a  boat.  meet  you  at   uh  000000  like  12:00  a.m.  in  Amsterdam   Port  Guzman.  I  have a  I  have  a  boat   ready  to  go.  If  you  have  a  brain,  you're   leaving.  And  that's  been  going  on  for   years.  For  years,  smart  people,  they   understand  that  they  are  the  cow  that  is   getting  that's  going  to  get  milked  to   death.  Okay?  And  instead,  they  bring   more  people  who  don't  work  or  or  work,   but  they  they  don't  earn  a  lot.  So,  they   don't  pay  a  lot  of  tax  and  then  they   need  all  of  the  welfare  and  all  of  that.   So  that  scale  is  just  tipping  faster  and   faster.  Smart  people  with  money,  with   skills,  with  assets,  they  live.  Others   come  in  and  is,  you  know,  soon  it's   going  to,  you  know,  it's  going  to  flip   the  whole  scale.  Now,  here's  the   problem,  guys.  If  you  look  at  the  math   of  it,  which  Invest  Answers  have  done,   holy  crap,  guys.  Holy  crap.  that  the  if   you  look  at  the  math  how  much  you're   paying  how  much  you're  actually  paying   with  this  36%  tax  on  unrealized  games   it's  not  something  you've  sold  even  it's   just  that  something  went  up  in  price  and   um  now  you  have  to  pay  based  on  that.  So   look  here  portfolio  over  time  when  there   is  no  unrealized  gains  tax  you  see  how   it  develops  you  see  how  it  grows  and  the   same  portfolio  but  where  you  have   unrealized  gain  tax  already  in  10  years   if  you  look  at  10  years  with  constant   let's  say  you  have  like  some  average   return  here  that  they  use  probably  like   average  stock  market  return  of  seven   seven  eight%.  So  without  annual  gain  you   have  massive  growth  with  annual  gain  you   don't  even  get  half  man  you  don't  even   get  half  okay  you  get  like  30%  okay   [laughter]   and  again  sometimes  like  this  annual   gain  stacks  look  at  silver  look  at   what's  been  what  what  happened  to  silver   I  think  it's  a  good  example  here  where   silver  rallied  into  the  year  end  and   then  collapsed  in  the  beginning  of   January  if  you  had  the  Dutch  wealth  uh   sorry  uh  u  not  wealth  but  unrealized   gain  stacks,  you  would  be  so  wrecked.   Let's  actually  see  silver  here  on  the   daily,  guys,  because  I  don't  think  many   of  you  understand  what  it  means  with   unrealized  gain  stacks.  It  means  that  on   January  1st,   uh  it  is  measured  uh  like  your  what  your   gain  is.  So,  let's  see.  Where's  January   1?  Here's  January  1st.  Okay.  Um   [laughter]   silver  on  Oh,  sorry.  It's  2025.  Guess   it's  it's  wrong.  Wait,  wait,  wait.  Yeah,   here  here.  On  January  1st,  uh  no,  it  is   correct.  It  is  correct.  Sorry,  it  is   correct.  Yeah,  is  this  correct?  Here  on   January  1st,  it's  measured  what  the   value  is.  So  in  this  case,  it's  77.  If   you  don't  sell  like  instantly  and  start   uh  raising  money  for  the  capital  gain   and  then  it  dumps,  you  see  here  it   dumped  back  here  to  63  and  this  year  I   mean  silver  is  in  a  bare  trend.  Likely   it  will  continue  dumping.  You  risk   paying  tax  on  assets  you  don't  even   have.  So  basically  it's  going  to  it's   going  to  be  quite  interesting  to  see  how   you  guys  in  the  Netherlands  do  it.  as   soon  as  the  year  closes  like  my  advice   to  you  is  to  start  selling  so  you  have   money  to  pay  for  the  tax  because  if  the   if  the  asset  dumps  let's  say  that  if   silver  which  was  super  volatile  towards   the  end  of  the  year  instead  of  pumping   here  what  if  it  just  did  like  this  uh   which  and  now  it's  kind  of  doing  that  uh   now  you  still  have  to  pay  tax  based  on   what  happened  here  okay  based  on  the   last  day  of  the  year  so  guys  it's  going   to  be  very  interesting  to  see  I  think   it's  the  flash  to  zero  for  all  of  this   western  overt  taxed  countries  uh  they   are  flashing  themselves.  They're   flashing  themselves  because  who  in  the   right  mind  like  any  person  that  respect   themselves  would  pay  this.  Who  would   allow  this  to  happen  to  them?  Because   you  also  have  to  look  at  the  trade  here.   Okay,  you  pay  it.  What  do  you  get?  What   do  you  get?  What  do  you  get  back?  Do  you   get  back  nice  uh  protection?  You  get   back  nice  service.  They  say  free   healthcare,  free  healthcare,  man.  With   this  kind  of  money,  you  know  what  kind   of  healthcare  you  can  get?  you  know,   [laughter]   with  this  with  this  kind  of  money  we   just  uh  we  just  saw,  you  you  know  what   healthcare  you  can  get  with  this  kind  of   uh  because  nothing  is  free,  guys.  That's   the  thing.  Nothing  is  free.  Some  someone   pays  you  miss  out  on  13  million  here.   And  again,  you  can  just  um  adjust  it  to   your  own.  Let's  say  you  invest  30K  and   then  it  go  grows  to  100K.  Uh  you  would   only  let's  say  it  grows  to  100K  wi  with   your  you  know  annual  tax.  It  would  be   300k  without  that  annual  tax.  So  just   you  don't  have  to  think  in  this  big   numbers.  Think  also  you  can  think  in   small  numbers  also  like  what  do  you   actually  okay  let's  say  free  healthare   free  man  healthcare  in  many  countries   you  pay  a  few  hundred  you  get  private   healthcare  it's  world  class  anyway  like   what  are  we  speaking  about  healthcare   like  it's  it's  not  a  you  know  it's  it's   not  worth  this  much.  [laughter]  Okay,   going  to  any  country  that  has  private   healthcare,  you're  going  to  see  you  pay   a  few  hundred  bucks  max  max  top  top  you   can  get  in  you  can  get  the  doctor  fast.   I  mean  in  these  countries  with  free   so-called  healthcare  you  cannot  get   healthcare  fast.  It's  like  Soviet  Union   you  want  to  get  a  car.  In  Soviet  Union   the  car  is  also  free  or  very  cheap  but   no  one  can  get  it.  You  have  to  wait  10   years.  So  when  you  have  the  supply  and   demand  being  messed  up  like  that  where   it's  free  meaning  everyone  can  get  it.   [laughter]  Uh  okay  but  then  it  means  you   have  to  wait  10  years  because  supply  and   dem  you  cannot  cheat  supply  and  demand.   Either  you  pay  with  money  uh  and  that's   how  supply  demand  is  regulated  because   there  is  a  finite  amount  of  doctors.   Well,  now  you  know  they  import  a  lot  of   the  doctor.  Let's  not  go  go  get  into   that.  But  yeah,  there's  a  finite  amount   of  real  doctor  and  infinite  amount  of   demand.  You  can  either  regulate  it  with   price  you  have  to  pay  for  it  or  you  can   regulate  it  with  time.  Okay,  you  have   problem  with  your  heart.  Come  back  in   three  months.  Maybe  we're  going  to  check   it  again.  So,  how  do  you  want  to   regulate  it?  Soviet  Union,  socialism,   communism,  they  regulate  with  time.  They   say  it's  free,  but  still  it's  a  it's   finite  amount.  You  have  to  wait.  Anyway,   guys.  Anyway,  guys.  So  this  uh  yeah,  if   you  are  in  Netherlands,  I  would  be  super   careful  here.  I  don't  know  what  else  is   going  on,  how  you  can  allow  this  to   happen.  It's  uh  Soviet  Netherlands.   Welcome  comrades.  Hope  you  have  a  great   socialistic  future.  It's  going  to  be  fun   to  see  from  the  sidelines.  It's  going  to   be  fun.  Guys,  we  have  to  wrap  up  like  in   2  minutes.  I  have  to  go  soon.  Look  here   guys.  This  kid,  he  wanted  to  uh  close   the  tab  and  see  what  happens  because  it   this  is  how  you  buy  your  shitcoin  and   then  you  hold  90%  down.   Uhoh.   Exactly,  guys.  If  you  come  and  you  say,   you  know,  I'm  still  down.  I'm  still   holding.  It's  fine.  But  you  have  to   understand  what  happened  here.  You   wanted  a  fast  gain,  like  your  goal  was   to  just,  you  know,  boop  and  that's  it.   Then  you  convince  yourself  that  you're  a   long-term  holder  and  you  love  the   fundamentals.  This  guy,  he's  all  about   water  now.  He  loves  water.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin jelenlegi helyzete azt mutatja, hogy alacsonyan van, és a piaci jelzések szerint további csökkenés várható. A grafikonok például azt tükrözik, hogy a bikák nem mutatnak kezdeményezést, és így a legkisebb ellenállás iránya lefelé mutat. Az átlagos befektetők számára most kínálkozik lehetőség alacsony áron vásárolni a kriptovalutát, mivel a következő hónapokban várhatóan 50K alá süllyedhet az ár. Az intézményi befektetők, mint az ETF-ek, nagyobb jelenlétük miatt most lehetőséget kínálnak a kisbefektetőknek is. Az altcoinok helyzete is kedvezőtlen, mivel folyamatosan csökkennek. A video hangoztatja, hogy sok készpénzmozgás történik a shortolás irányába, amely a jelenlegi piaci környezetben a leghatékonyabb stratégia.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin is currently in a precarious position, hovering above a buy zone, with market signals indicating more potential downside ahead. The charts reflect a lack of bullish initiative, suggesting that the path of least resistance is downward. There is an opportunity for average investors to buy Bitcoin at lower prices, as projections indicate that it may drop below 50K in the coming months. Institutional players, such as ETFs, are increasingly present, giving retail investors a chance to participate. Altcoins are also underperforming, indicating a consistent downward trend. The video emphasizes that shorting is currently the most effective strategy in this market environment.",
