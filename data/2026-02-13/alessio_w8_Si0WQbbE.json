    "transcript": "Hey  guys,  Allesia.  Hope  you're  well.  So,   in  this  video,  we're  going to  take  a   look  chart  of  Bitcoin  and  after  a   significant  and  heavy  drop  in  the  price   of  Bitcoin.  We're  going  to  ask  the   question,  is  Bitcoin  getting  closer  to  a   potential  bottom  and  what  could  likely   happen  in  the  next  several  weeks.  All   right,  guys,  join  me.   All right,  guys.  Welcome  back.  Speaking   to  you  today  from  Forest  Mir  in  England.   I  just  came  here  today  for  a  really   beautiful  spot  here  uh  and  just  going   for  a  walk.  All  right,  guys.  Before  we   take  a  look  at  the  chart  of  Bitcoin,   there's  something  important  I  want  to   mention  here  first.  Some  of  you  probably   saying  to  me  right  now,  hey  Allesio,   back  a  few  months  ago  in  December,  you   were  quite  skeptical  that  we're  in  a   bare  market  on  Bitcoin.  What  are  you   saying  now?  So,  I  want  to  address  this   point.  Uh,  firstly,  as  I'm  sure  most  of   you  know,  look,  there's  a  lot  of  people   out  there  making  videos  on  YouTube.  And   as  I'm  sure  you  know,  a  lot  of  these   guys  on  YouTube  just  put  out  a  video   simply  to  get  clicks.  And  then  you  have   another  bunch  of  people  out  there  who   make  videos  just  by  reacting  to  what's   happening  to  the  price.  You  know,  they   say,  \"Oh  my  goodness,  price  is  crashing.   It's  the  end  of  the  world.\"  And  things   like  that.  Now,  if  you've  been  watching   my  videos  for  some  time,  then  you   probably  know  that  when  I  put  out  a   video,  I  have  to  believe  in  what  I'm   saying.  So,  I  have  to  have  confidence   that  what  I'm  saying  is  correct.  So,   that  is  why  I'm  often  very  cautious   about  what  I  say  because  I  like  to  wait   for  evidence  and  proof  about  what's   happening  on  the  price  action.  That  is   why  in  December,  I  said,  look,  I'm   waiting  until  the  price  of  Bitcoin   confirms  that  we  are  indeed  in  a  bare   market.  Now,  how  does  the  price  of   Bitcoin  confirm  that?  quite  simply  by   waiting  for  a  rally,  a  bounce  back   towards  the  weekly  21  EMA  and  then   getting  rejected  from  that  level.  That's   what  I  said  in  December.  And  of  course,   that  is  what  Bitcoin  did.  In  January,   Bitcoin  rallied  back  towards  the  21   weekly  moving  average,  as  you  can  see   right  there,  towards  the  96K,  97K  range   and  almost  made  contact  with  the   21weekly  moving  average  and  then  got   deflected,  got  rejected  from  that  level.   And  that  is  why  I  put  out  this  warning   back  in  January  when  I  was in  Istanbul.   Here's  a  clip.  That  recent  price  drop  on   the  price  of  Bitcoin  seems  to  indicate   that  Bitcoin  is  now  getting  rejected   from  the  21  weekly  moving  average  or   just  close  to  that  level.  So  guys,  as  it   stands  right  now  as  I'm  making  this   video,  it's  not  good  news  for  Bitcoin  at   the  moment.  The  odds  have  increased   towards  the  bearish  side.  In  other   words,  as  long  as  Bitcoin  stays  below   the  January  highs  and  below  the  21w   weekly,  for  now  sellers  or  bears  have   control.  Uh  because  at  the  moment,  given   that  red  bar,  given  the  recent  price   drop,  at  the  moment  the  probabilities   are  increasing  that  Bitcoin  could   potentially  now  move  to  new  lows  and   potentially  below  the  80K  level  and  to   the  70s.  All right  guys,  so  as  you  heard   when  I  was  in  Istanbul,  you  probably  saw   my  video  and  I  issued  a  warning,  a   strong  warning  that  because  Bitcoin  had   got  rejected  from  the  weekly  21  EMA,   which  was  a  strong  warning  sign.  And  by   the  way,  that  warning  in  January  came   just  in  time  before  the  big  drop   occurred  below  80K.  And  by  the  way,   here's  what  I  said  in  the  member  video   some  weeks  ago  back  in  January.  At  the   moment  here,  the  risk  appears  to  be   higher  for  a  potential  breakdown.  And  as   mentioned,  we  have  to  be  extra  cautious   because  Bitcoin  seems  to  be  showing   weakness.  Again,  as  long  as  we  stay   below  the  January  highs  and  below  93   94K,  the  probability  is  we're  dealing   with  a  wave  five,  a  wave  five  decline   below  80K.  So  there  is  potential  here   that  if  Bitcoin  overshoots  then  it  could   potentially  overshoot  to  firstly  66,550   and  potentially  even  lower  to  near  63K.   All right  guys,  as  you  heard  in  the   member  videos,  I  was  warning  that   Bitcoin  could  likely  drop  in  a  wave  five   towards  the  downside  targets  to  70K  and   then  potentially  even  lower  to  63K  and   60K,  which  is  essentially  what  we've   seen  so  far.  By  the  way,  as  some  of  you   probably  know,  63,000  is  approximately   the  50%  level  from  the  all-time  highs  of   Bitcoin.  So,  for  example,  if  you  take   the  all-time  highs  of  Bitcoin  back  in   October  near  126,296   divided  by  two,  then  what  you  get   approximately  is  63,000,  which  is  the   level  we  dropped  down  to.  And  that  is   important  because  in  previous  major   drops,  crashes,  and  corrections  in   Bitcoin  in  2022  and  in  2018,  we've  often   seen  a  drop  down  to  the  50%  level.  In   other  words,  the  50%  of  the  all-time   highs  of  the  price  of  Bitcoin.  And   that's  quite  interesting  because   typically  the  price  of  Bitcoin  finds  a   floor  or  some  kind  of  a  bottom  near  the   50%  level.  Not  always.  Sometimes  it  goes   below  that  level.  But  nonetheless,   usually  when  price  of  Bitcoin  drops  by   at  least  50%  from  its  all-time  highs,  it   typically  finds  a  floor  or  a  bottom  in   the  next  several  weeks  or  at least  it   means  price  of  Bitcoin  could  be  getting   near  a  potential  bottom.  And  by  the  way   guys,  before  we  continue,  I'm  not  trying   to  say  I  got  everything  perfectly   correct  in  my  analysis.  No,  I  did  not.   you  know,  when  it  comes  to  the  markets   and  chart  analysis,  you  know,  we're  all   students  of  the  market.  We're  always   learning.  Okay,  now  going  back  to  the   chart  of  Bitcoin,  this  drop  in  the  price   of  Bitcoin  has  been  pretty  severe  and   it's  been  very  sharp.  It's  often  called   a  waterfall  decline.  And  guess  what,   guys?  This  major  drop  that  occurred  uh   recently.  What's  happened  is  that  the   RSI  has  now  become  extremely  oversold.   So,  in  the  past  when  Bitcoin  has  become   so  extremely  oversold  as  it  has  occurred   recently,  typically  the  price  of  Bitcoin   is  getting  near  capitulation  or  a   bottom.  In  fact,  what  recently  happened   as  well  is  we  can  see  extreme   acceleration  on  the  price  of  Bitcoin.   That  means  the  price  of  Bitcoin  is   getting  near  capitulation.  In  other   words,  a  major  low  or  a  bottom.  Now,   don't  get  me  wrong  here.  I'm  not  saying   the  price  of  Bitcoin  cannot  go  lower.  It   could,  but  I  think  even  if  the  price  of   Bitcoin  were  to  drop  slightly  lower,  I   still  think  we're  getting  very  close  to   a  potential  bottom  and  capitulation   because  the  price  of  Bitcoin  essentially   is  extremely  overstretched.  If  you   think,  for  example,  of  an  elastic  band,   now  take  an  elastic  band  and  stretch  it,   okay?  And  the  more  that  elastic  band   becomes  stretched  or  overstretched,  the   more  likely  it's  going  to  bounce  back.   So  right  now,  the  price  of  Bitcoin  is   extremely  overstretched.  It's  moved  too   far  too  fast  to  the  downside,  which   means  the  probability  of  some  kind  of  a   bounce  back,  some  kind  of  a  strong  rally   is  now  increasing.  By  the  way,  guys,   we're  not  far  away  from  the  200  weekly   moving  average,  which  is  a  very   important  key  support  level  for  the   price  of  Bitcoin.  In  the  past,  usually   the  price  of  Bitcoin  finds  a  floor  or   some  kind  of  support.  In  other  words,  a   level  where  it  potentially  rebounds  from   the  200  weekly  moving  average.  So  guys,   in  my  view,  the  price  of  Bitcoin  has   become  extremely  oversold.  And  also,  as   I  mentioned  earlier,  we're  support   levels  where  Bitcoin  has  dropped  to  a   50%  level  near  63K  and  also  some  key   moving  averages.  So,  what  I'm  expecting   is  a  very  strong  bounce  and  rally  in  the   next  several  weeks  and  months  on  the   price  of  Bitcoin.  Other  than  the  reasons   just  given  you  based  on  the  oversold   conditions  and  overstretched  conditions,   we've  had  now  five  waves  to  the   downside.  If  you  go  from  the  all-time   highs  of  Bitcoin  back  in  October  to  the   lows  we  just  reached,  we  can  count  five   waves  to  the  downside.  And  that  means   this  guys,  after  five  waves  to  the   downside,  then  we  typically  see  a  strong   correction,  an  ABC  correction  for   example,  and  that  correction  or  bounce   after  the  fivewave  drop  is  usually  very   strong,  very  powerful.  So  based  on  the   probabilities,  what  I'm  seeing  on  the   chart  of  Bitcoin  after  the  fivewave   drop,  I  think  it's  quite  probable  we're   going to  see  a  very  strong  powerful   bounce  on  the  price  of  Bitcoin  in  the   next  several  weeks.  And  by  the  way  guys,   that  bounce  and  rally  in  the  price  of   Bitcoin  is  something  that  a  lot  of   people  out  there  are  not  expecting.  You   see  guys,  a  lot  of  people  right  now  in   the  Bitcoin  community  are  very   pessimistic.  The  sentiment  on  Bitcoin   right  now  is  extremely  negative  and   pessimistic.  There's  a  lot  of  people  out   there  right  now  who  probably  given  up   and  are  very  scared  about  the  price  of   Bitcoin.  So  guys,  in  my  view,  even  if   price  of  Bitcoin  makes  a  lower  low,   again,  I'm  not  trying  to  say  to  you  that   Bitcoin  has  definitely  bottomed  right   now,  but  even  if  Bitcoin  has  not   bottomed  and  makes  a  slight  lower  low,  I   still  think  we're  getting  very  close  to   a  bottoming  formation  and  capitulation   in  the  price  of  Bitcoin.  So,  I  think   we're  very  close  to  the  conditions  we   usually  see  for  a  strong  bounce  and  a   rally  on  the  price  of  Bitcoin.  And  that   is  what  I  think  is  quite  probable  and   quite  likely  in  the  next  several  weeks   and  months.  And  by  the  way,  this  should   come  as  no  surprise  because  even  in  bare   markets  like  for  example  the  one  we  had   in  2022,  there  were  very  strong  powerful   rallies  and  bounces  like  the  one  you  see   here.  Uh  again,  some  people  think  that   in  a  bare  market  you  cannot  have  a   bounce  or  a  rally.  No,  you  can.  So  that   I  think  is  quite  likely  for  the  price  of   Bitcoin  in  the  next  several  weeks  and   months.  And  by  the  way,  I'm  going  to   cover  the  key  targets  I'm  looking  for  in   the  member  video.  So  make  sure  you  check   that  out.

    "summary_en": "Bitcoin has experienced a significant drop in price, and the analyzed chart movements suggest it may be approaching potential lows in the near future. The current situation, indicated by key moving averages and the 21-week EMA, reflects a bearish trend with sellers in control. The analyst mentions that Bitcoin could drop to new lows, possibly around $63,000. The RSI indicates that Bitcoin is overstretched, suggesting a close proximity to capitulation. A strong rally is anticipated, as prices typically bounce back when they become excessively stretched. Market volatility is to be expected, with a caveat that while the bottom may not have been reached, the probability of a coming rally is notable.",
