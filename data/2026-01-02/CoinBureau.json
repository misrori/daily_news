        "transcript": "Everyone was waiting for it. The blowoff top, the face melting parabolic rally that was supposed to send Bitcoin to $200,000 by Christmas 2025. We were promised a super cycle. We were promised the God candle. Instead, we got a 30% crash, extreme fear, and a lump of coal in our stockings. If you're looking at your portfolio right now wondering where it all went wrong, you're not alone. The Q4 explosion didn't happen. So, does this mean the famous four-year cycle is finally dead? Has the having lost its magic? Or has the market just evolved into something entirely different? Something that requires a completely new strategy if you want to survive 2026. Today, we're going to find out. We're going to look at why the cycle broke, why the smart money is actually targeting 2026, and exactly how you need to adjust your exit plan right now. You might want to take notes for this one. My name is Louis and you are watching the Coin Bureau. Now, before we break down the new timeline, we need to do a little housekeeping. First off, I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial advice. We are in uncharted territory here, folks. So, please do your own research. And secondly, if you appreciate us digging through the institutional data, so you don't have to prove it by punching that like button. It really does help the algorithm find other confused investors who need to see this. Done. Well, awesome. Let's get into it. Let's start with the cold, hard reality of where we stand today. At the time of shooting this video, it is December 30th, 2025, and Bitcoin is trading around $87,000. Now, 87K might sound great if you bought back in 2023, but context is everything. We are down over 30% from the all-time high of roughly $126,000 set back on October 6th. More importantly, Q4, which is historically the most bullish quarter for crypto, well, it has been a disaster. Bitcoin has registered a loss of nearly 24% this quarter. To put that in perspective, the last time we saw a Q4 this bad was in 2018, right in the depths of the bare market. Logically, this shouldn't be happening. The four-year cycle model, which has guided us faithfully for over a decade, predicted a peak in late 2025. In 2013, we peaked in November. In 2017, we peaked in December. In 2021, we peaked in November again. So, everyone positioned themselves for a November or December top in 2025. But the market, as it loves to do, humbled the consensus. Instead, we peaked in October, way earlier than the historical average suggests that we should have. So, what happened? Why did the post having explosion fizzle out? Well, the primary suspect is sitting right there on Wall Street. ETFs. Since their launch in early 2024, the spot Bitcoin ETFs have sucked up over $100 billion in assets. This has been incredible for price appreciation, sure, but it's come with a hidden cost. the death of volatility. Back in 2012, Bitcoin's volatility was over 200%. Today, it's hovering around 50%. The ETF effect has essentially smoothed out the cycle. Think about it. In previous cycles, retail investors like you and me drove the price. But retail is emotional. Retail FOMOs in all at once, creating that vertical god candle, and then panic sells all at once, creating an 80% crash. But now institutions hold nearly a quarter of the supply. Pension funds and corporate treasuries don't FOMO into a green candle on a Friday night. They rebalance quarterly. They buy when the price dips and sell when it rips to maintain a target allocation. This constant passive flow acts as a dampener. It caps the upside, preventing that insane blowoff top we were all waiting for. But here is the good news. It also cushions the downside. Notice how we haven't dropped 70% but instead stopped at 30%. That is the ETF bid wall in action. But the ETFs aren't the only culprit. We also have to talk about the macro disconnect. Historically, Bitcoin bull runs coincide with the Federal Reserve printing money. Loose money equals number go up. But 2025 was weird. For most of this year, the Fed was actually tightening, pulling liquidity out of the system through quantitative tightening or QT. Real yields were high and the cost of money was high. Bitcoin rallied to 126,000 despite the Fed trying to slow things down, largely thanks to that institutional demand that we just mentioned, but you could only swim upstream for so long. And by October, the liquidity drought finally caught up with the market. The Santa Alley was cancelled because there simply wasn't enough easy money slloshing around to fund it. However, just when it seems like the bears have won, here's the twist. On December 1st, the Fed officially ended QT. They have stopped draining liquidity. And history tells us that the end of QT is usually a precursor to the next phase, liquidity expansion. And this brings us to the most important part of this video, the new year timeline. If the four-year cycle based on the having is indeed broken, what replaces it? The answer is the liquidity cycle. If you overlay Bitcoin's price with global M2, that is the measure of all of the money in the world, correlation is pretty accurate. And according to global liquidity models, the cycle didn't peak in 2025. It is instead projected to peak in mid 2026. And this aligns with what we are hearing from some of the biggest names in the space. Tom Lee from Fundstrat is predicting a super cycle where Bitcoin grinds up to $200,000 throughout 2026. He argues that because the cycle started earlier, remember that preh havinging all-time high in March 2024, it is going to last longer but be less explosive. It's a left translated start with a right translated finish. I know, I know, technical jargon. Simply put, the party started up early, took a nap in late 2025, and is waking up for the afterparty in 2026. Even the big banks are on board. City Bank, Bernstein, Standard, Chartered, they are all forecasting the real peak to land between 150K and 200K next year. Gayscale is calling this the dawn of the institutional era. Basically, we are moving from a boom and bust cycle to a grind and hold cycle. So, what does this mean for you? For me, me. If you're still holding bags, waiting for a 2025 miracle, well, the market has changed and your exit plan might need to change with it. Here is the reality check. If you are waiting for a blowoff top, a day where Bitcoin goes up 20% in 24 hours and your altcoins do a 100x, well, you might be waiting forever. With volatility dampening, that signal might never come. Instead, we need to look at different indicators. First, forget the calendar. Watch the liquidity. Keep an eye on the Fed's balance sheet in Global M2. As long as those are expanding in early 2026, the trend is your friend. Second, look at onchain metrics like the MVRVZ score. Historically, cycle tops happen when this score hits the red zone, usually above five. Right now, we are sitting near two. That suggests that we are in a midcycle correction, not a cycle ending crash. And third, and most importantly, stop trying to time the absolute top. In this new lower volatility environment, the DCA out strategy is king. Instead of selling everything at a specific price target, you could sell small percentages as we grind up. This protects you if the super cycle turns out to be a super trap, but keeps you in the game if we do run to 200K. Not financial advice, of course. Look, I know that this Q4 has been painful. Seeing your portfolio bleed out during the holidays is never fun, but zooming out, the fundamental thesis hasn't broken. The having supply shock is real. It's just being digested differently by Wall Street than it was by crypto dgens. The demand also is real. Black Rocks ETF buyers didn't buy $60 billion worth of Bitcoin to dump it for a loss. And the macro winds are shifting in our favor as central banks prepare to turn the money printers back on in 2026. The four-year cycle as we knew it, the predictable clockwork boom and bust probably is dead, but it has been replaced by something potentially much more powerful. A mature liquiditydriven secular bull market. The easy money of the golden bull run might be over, but the smart money is just getting started. Now, I want to hear from you. Do you think the cycle is dead or are we just taking a breather before 2026? Are you buying this dip or are you packing your bags? Let me know in the comments below. And if you found this reality check useful, remember to smash that like button and subscribe to the Coin Bureau for more datadriven crypto content. That's going to be it for today. So, thank you all for watching and I'll see you again very soon. This Lewis signing off."
