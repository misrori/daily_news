        "transcript": "Arc Invests, Kathy Wood, and Tasha Keany just made some pretty big predictions about the future of Tesla's stock price and how Kathy is expecting 2026 to roll out in terms of the markets. I've got two clips for you. These are the type of videos I love. >> Tasha, I'm going to come to you. Uh, when do you think Tesla's share price may reach that next breakthrough moment? I know we talk about autonomous uh taxi networks a lot. >> Thanks, Dan. Um, you know, in terms of major catalysts for Tesla, uh, we recently saw on X that Elon said that he expects, uh, for Tesla to be able to remove the operator in the vehicle in Austin within the next few weeks. Uh, so so what does this mean? You know, currently the um the robot taxi service is autonomous, but there's still someone in the car. They're not in the driver's seat. They're in the passenger seat, but this would be, you know, just the passenger riding in the vehicle. So true autonomy. We do expect there to still be some uh remote assistance feature that would be someone outside the car if the car gets into trouble. Um but this is a major milestone for Tesla in terms of you know improving the autonomous technology to to scale the robo taxi service and you know I say scale because that's really Tesla's advantage here. Um I mean let's look at Whimo. Whimo uh recently announced that they are in you know 10 cities now operating. They plan to be in over 20 cities by the end of next year. Um, except they only have singledigit thousands of vehicles on the road. Um, I think today we just saw there was a a recall notice of that would suggest there are roughly 3,000 Whimos out there, but um, you know, I would say singledigit, thousand safe assumption. Uh, so compare that to what Tesla is able to do. Um and of course it depends on what they prioritize versus customer sales and the or the robo taxi fleet but um Tesla can produce thousands of cars you know in a single day. Um last quarter they produced half a million vehicles. So um Whimo's really paving the way uh for the regulatory barriers. Um and Tesla while they you know may may come second in a city, we think that they have a key advantage in terms of actually scaling the fleet which really matters to bring the utilization rate down which means improving the underlying economics the cost per mile um ultimately you know off eventually undercutting today's rideill prices which is what we expect to expand the market for robo taxis far past what we see rideill as today. Um so as you know from our published price target we think that robo taxis will uh contribute to the um what we believe like the majority of the uh enterprise value of Tesla by 2029. Um you know and we had assumed $2,600 per share of Tesla at that time. Uh that's really driven by robo taxi. So this this operator out is really a pivotal moment. Uh look forward to that. Look forward to more um research from us on Optimus and uh space data centers. But for now, robo taxis. >> While ARK's $2,600 price target is driven primarily by robo taxis, Tesla's next two business lines, humanoid robots, and orbital AI data centers could make autonomy look like a warm-up act for what's actually happening. Tasha Keiny concluded her robo taxi analysis by saying, \"Looking forward to more research from us on Optimus and space data centers.\" Elon Musk stated at Tesla's shareholder meeting that they're launching the fastest production ramp of any large complex manufacturing product ever, targeting 100 million Optimus units per year and potentially a billion a year. Robo taxi opportunity is genuinely enormous. Tesla can produce half a million vehicles in a single quarter, while has struggled to reach 3,000 cars across all of their markets combined over nearly a decade. That manufacturing dominance translates directly into better unit economics, lower cost per mile, and the ability to undercut current ride hail prices in ways no competitor can match. Asks math on robo taxis contributing the majority of Tesla's enterprise value by 2029 is solid analysis based on real advantages Tesla actually has. What makes Tasha's closing comment so interesting, though, is that Ark still explicitly excludes Optimus from their valuation models. Most analysts justify this by saying humanoid robots won't meaningfully impact Tesla's business within their forecast timeline. They might be right about the timing, but they're almost certainly wrong about the magnitude. Elon recently announced plans for a million unit production line in Fremont as line one, followed by a 10 million unit line and then eventually a 100 million unit facility that he joked might need to be on Mars. These aren't casual numbers thrown around for headlines. Tesla already manufactures complicated robotic systems at scale. Every vehicle they produce is essentially a four-w wheeled robot with batteries, power electronics, motors, AI chips, and vision-based autonomy. The Optimus humanoid is the same architecture with arms and legs instead of wheels. Not financial advice, but the potential financial implications get absurd very quickly when you actually model them out. Assume Tesla reaches just 10 million Optimus units per year, far below their stated goals. And let's say each sells for $25,000. That's 250 billion in hardware revenue annually. Now add a conservative $1,000 per month software subscription for operating these robots, which is a fraction of what businesses would pay for equivalent human labor. That's another $120 billion per year in reoccurring revenue. High margin revenue from just one year's production. Run those robots for a decade and you're looking at over a trillion dollars in cumulative software revenue from a single year's manufacturing output. Scale that to 100 million units and the numbers become genuinely incomprehensible. Space data centers represent an equally enormous opportunity which not many people are covering. The physics actually work better in orbit than on Earth. Cooling is essentially free because you just radiate heat into the vacuum of space. Power is free and available 24 hours a day from solar panels. Latency can also actually be lower because laser communication through a vacuum is faster than fiber optics through glass. SpaceX has 10,000 Starink satellites in orbit right now and can deploy many, many more. Each satellite could carry inference chips, which means potentially there's a path to millions of inference chips processing AI workloads in space powered by free energy with cooling that costs nothing. Tesla is designing AI chips that Elon says will eventually exceed all other AI chips combined in production volume. Those chips will end up in data centers on Earth, in Optus robot, in Tesla vehicles, and increasingly in orbitable compute platforms. The pieces are all connecting in a way I don't think most people are fully aware of. So, when Ark says robo taxis will drive Tesla to $2,600 by 2029, they probably think that's the flaw for the company whose next two products could be larger than the entire autonomous vehicle market. Next up, we have a huge clip from Kathy Wood, who is about to break down the biggest risks facing the economy heading into 2026. And her conclusion might surprise you. She's actually incredibly bullish on what's coming, but only if the Trump administration can execute on a very specific playbook. The risks she outlines aren't about recessional collapse. They're about whether politicians can resist the temptation to mess things up when the economic engine is already firing on all cylinders. What do you think are the biggest fiscal and monetary risks potentially next year? >> I'll start with monetary. Um, I think if we were going to, if the Fed were going to be populated uh by individuals who believe that growth is inflationary and uh and and there was a lot of dissension on the Fed, I think that would be an issue. Um, I think if Kevin Hasset or Governor Waller uh either one of them is at the helm next year, I don't think that will be a problem. Though the voters uh could disscent uh and and cause a lot of uncertainty in the market. Um, I'm already hearing the administration, including Howard Lutnik, uh, very recently on CNBC talk about growth not being inflationary and quite in fact quite the opposite. uh in the 80s and 90s as uh real GDP growth was picking up uh inflation did come down consistently and uh I think we're going to see that again as the supply shock associated with COVID and tariffs to some extent as they pass through the system and uh and we move to the other side of um all of that confusion um in terms of fiscal policy. Um, I think if if the Trump administration uh is not enjoying a a strong growth environment with inflation and interest rates falling, uh, President Trump could become more of a lame duck uh, sooner than we expect, meaning uh, he'll probably be challenged from a tax policy point of you we love the tax policies the corporate tax rate coming down to 10%. Uh and uh individuals uh enjoying big refunds this year because of no tax on tips uh uh overtime uh large parts of social security, the doubling of the the salt deduction and and uh uh child care tax credits. Um, but if if we're in a weak economy, uh, we're going to get a a lot of angst around the midterm elections and, you know, uh, we we could see flailing around with, you know, new temporary spending measures, which is the last thing we need. Uh, we really need to grow out of the deficit. And I do believe this administration has put in place policies to do just that. But if for some reason we're wrong on that, um, the deficit will become a problem for for the bond markets. >> Kathy believes the Federal Reserve's biggest risk is appointing leaders who think economic growth causes inflation. When historical evidence from the 80s and '90s shows the exact opposite relationship, the conventional wisdom on Wall Street says that when the economy grows too fast, inflation follows. More jobs means more spending means higher prices. The Fed has operated under this assumption for decades, raising interest rates whenever growth accelerates to prevent the economy from overheating. Kathy is pushing back hard on this framework. She's pointing to a multi-deade period where strong GDP growth coincided with falling inflation, not rising inflation. The 80s and '90s saw robust economic expansion while inflation steadily declined from double digits to low single digits. So in Cathy's mind, growth and price stability can absolutely coexist. The mechanism she's describing relates to supply and demand dynamics. When businesses invest and expand, they increase the supply of goods and services. More supply relative to demand puts downward pressure on prices. Productivity improvements from technology and capital investments mean more output per worker, which further reduces costs. The inflation of the past few years came from supply shocks. COVID disrupting manufacturing, shipping delays, and energy constraints. These are temporary disruptions that pass through the system, not permanent structural changes requiring indefinite high interest rates. The tariff situation adds another layer of complexity. Kathy acknowledges that tariffs can cause temporary price increases as they pass through the system. A one-time price adjustment from input duties is fundamentally different from sustained inflation driven by monetary policy. Once businesses adjust their supply chains and their prices reset, the inflationary impacts fade. Her thought is the Fed shouldn't treat temporary supply side adjustments the same way they treat demanddriven price spirals. Getting this decision wrong could lead to overtightening that damages growth unnecessarily.

        "transcript": "Two of the most controversial valuations in the market right now. Tesla and SpaceX, both Elon Musk companies, both trading at prices that traditional metrics can't justify. Dan Ives and Eva just broke down why they think the bulls are right. And it comes down to one word that changes everything about how you should think about these businesses. So, yes, I understand the AI future, but what about the car present for Tesla? >> I mean, look, if you're owning it for numbers and for the car business, I mean, I think that's the wrong reason. I mean, in my >> But, but it has to fund the other stuff, right? And it's funding it in part through selling cars. >> So, it has to sell enough cars in order to not just make a profit, but also to fund some of these ambitions, right? I look at it almost like a bracket like in other words like a worst case base case best case as long as it's sort of above a worst case and I think now it is in terms of deliveries then the business model continues to play out and that ultimately does fund what I really view as the key piece right which is autonomous and robotics future look in terms of if you started this year and I told you where numbers was going to be at the end of the year you're like where's the stock going to be based in those numbers you'd be like ah it's 200 00 buck 250 >> right >> but but it speaks to my view I mean you have talked about a lot is that the when you look at physical AI plays there's Nvidia and Tesla is I think the two best out there and now it's about proving it out but that as an investor right now if you're bullish on Tesla you're not focused on consensus 26 of course >> you but to your point I do think deliveries has stabilized I think China's actually shown growth and you look at the last few quarters like you it's actually better than expected. >> I'm curious because you said you have worst case, base case, best case. What's your worst case scenario for Tesla? >> Well, I think worst case if you go back like 6 months ago, I mean we we felt like worst case. Yeah, >> it felt like worst case because also given deliveries, given a lot of the brand issues, given what you saw in Europe and obviously, you know, tax credits coming off in terms of the US. So we were trending toward a worst case and look it spoke to to my view where Musk need to be wartime CEO focused on this core Tesla chapter which I view is probably the most important chapter ever for Tesla and for Musk. So I think you now are seeing a different Elon. You're seeing a different company. >> And look Jul, I think we sit here a year from now the stocks at 650700 >> or it's lower than here. In other words, like this is a very >> like a make or break year. I >> I'd call it a make or break year and I think it's going to be make relative to auton 30 cities showing the volume production not just delaying it. I think that's why it's such an important year. >> Okay. So you mentioned a couple of the goals there like give me the top three things that it needs to do this year to push it higher rather than going above. >> Well, one I mean you need to be in 30 cities. I mean when so when you look at Austin's and now what we're seeing in California and some other cities you need to be in 30 cities by robo taxi >> with robo taxi so so that's one two safety driver now you're starting to see that now in Austin we saw it firsthand you need to see the geoence area expand to a point where I believe it gets significantly more than where Whimo is right you know relative to even having a huge head start and I think the third it's volume production in other words like you actually need to show volume production of cyber cabs coming out of Gigafactory in Austin. Look, I think those those are the three that are extremely important to show, okay, is the whole story going to take hold this year? No. But it shows that like those are huge building blocks to what I view as kind of the future of Tesla. >> And it's interesting that you say that because like Musk has always been good at vision and big pronouncements, but what you're talking about is execution. and there his record has been less even or you know or at least less consistent on time, right? He's he's had a lot of delays in the past. So you're confident though that you think he can hit those goals. >> Look, it's just like SpaceX. I mean, you're trying to solve the most complex AI, you know, I'd say like some of the biggest problems out there. When you do get to full autonomous, you're dealing with lives. You can't just be 99%. I mean, so, so you're talking about the margin of error you almost can't even, you know, look at in in a spreadsheet. So, this is something where it's so important that they do this from a safety perspective and continue to stretch it out step by step. But look, I mean, I think autonomous alone is worth a trillion. And I think when you look at robotic, you look at optimist, you look at this all playing out, that's how I get to in a bull case a $3 trillion valuation, you know, at the end of 26. Dan Ies is reframing how investors should view Tesla's car business entirely. The cars are funding mechanisms that keeps Tesla's AI and robotics ambitions alive long enough to actually reach scale. Dan Ives use what he calls a bracket approach when analyzing Tesla. Worst case, base case and best case scenario. His argument is straightforward. As long as deliveries stay above worst case territory, the car business generates enough cash flow to fund autonomous driving and robotics development. He explicitly tells investors that if you're buying Tesla for the number of cars themselves, you're buying it for the wrong reason. This framing matters because it completely changes how you evaluate Tesla as an investment. Most analysts still cover Tesla like an automaker. They build spreadsheet models around vehicle deliveries, average selling prices, and gross margins per car. And when those numbers disappoint, they downgrade the stock. When those numbers beat, they upgrade it. The whole conversation stays trapped in the automotive metrics. Dan is saying that that approach fundamentally misunderstands what Tesla actually is at this point. The car business is a cash generating engine. Full stop. It exists to produce enough profit and free cash flow to fund research and development on autonomous driving, to build out manufacturing capacity for new products like the Cyber Cab, to develop Optimus robots, and to expand energy storage. The question for investors should be, is the car business generating enough cash to keep these other initiatives moving forward? If yes, then the thesis remains intact regardless of whether Tesla beats or misses delivery estimates by a few percentage points. This pattern shows up throughout business history. Amazon ran its retail operation at razer thin margins for years while pumping resources into Amazon web services. Wall Street analysts kept asking when Amazon would show profit in retail. Meanwhile, AWS was quietly becoming one of the most valuable businesses on Earth. The retail operation was never going to be the main profit driver. It was the funding bridge that got AWS to escape velocity. Apple did something similar in the early days. The Mac business funded years of research and development that eventually produced the iPod, which funded the research that produced the iPhone. Each generation of Cash Cow funded the next generation of Moonshot until the Moonshot became the new cash cow. Tesla finds itself in that same structural position. The Model Y and Model 3 generate cash. That cash funds autonomy development, robot development, and manufacturing innovation. If autonomy works, it becomes a business worth multiples of the car operation. The car business gets remembered as the bridge that made everything else possible. What makes Dan's framing particularly relevant right now is the timing. Tesla went through a brutal stretch where the funding bridge actually looked a little bit more shaky. Deliveries were declining. Brand perception issues, especially here in Europe, were hurting demand. The removal of tax credits in certain markets will add pressure. There was some speculation about whether Tesla could maintain enough volume and margin to keep funding its ambitions at the pace required. Dan describes that period as trending towards his worst case scenario. And the worst case basically means the funding bridge breaks. Not enough cash generation to fund the AI research at a competitive pace. Not enough resources to build out cyber cab manufacturing. The whole thesis depends on maintaining that bridge until the other businesses can stand on their own. But Dan sees the trajectory shifting. China showing growth. Recent quarters outperforming expectations. Musk back in what Dan calls wartime CEO mode. focused on execution. The bridge is holding strong. And this leads directly into why Dan calls this a makeorb breakak year for Tesla. He's usually specific about outcomes. A year from now, the stock is either dramatically higher or lower than today. No muddling along in the middle. He does it for a reason because that kind of framing catches attention because most analysts hedge. They give price targets with wide ranges and qualified language. Dan is saying there's no comfortable middle ground here. Either Tesla proves out the autonomous thesis at meaningful scale or it doesn't and the market will price whichever outcome becomes clear. The three milestones he outlines tells you what proving it out actually means in practice. First, Robo Taxi is operating in 30 cities by next summer. Right now, Tesla is operating supervised autonomy in Austin, San Francisco, and is expanding out to other cities. The jump to 30 cities represents a massive scaling of operational complexity. Getting to 30 cities by summer will demonstrate that Tesla can deploy at geographical scale without endless city bycity tuning. Second expansion beyond safety drivers. Removing the safety driver is the leap that transforms the economics. With the safety driver, you're still paying for human labor. The cost structure looks like a traditional taxi or ride share with some automation assist. Without the safety driver, the economics flip entirely. The cost per mile drops dramatically. The potential for profit per vehicle goes vertical. Every Tesla running as a robo taxi without a driver becomes pure margin after the vehicle cost is covered. Dan seeing unsupervised operation expanding in Austin suggests that transition is beginning. Third volume production of cyber cabs at Giga Austin. This is the manufacturing piece. Having the technology work is one challenge. Building the vehicles designed specifically for robo taxi operation at scale is another challenge entirely. The Cyber Cab is purpose-built for autonomous ride hailing. No steering wheel, no pedals, optimized for passenger comfort and durability over hundreds of thousands of miles. Volume production at Giga Austin proves Tesla can build these vehicles at costs that makes the robo taxis economics work and work very profitably. Prototype production means nothing. Volume production changes everything. Each of these milestones builds on the others. Geographic expansion proves the technology. Safety driver removal proves the economics. Manufacturing scale proves the ability to deploy at a scale that actually captures the market opportunity. But there's something that everyone who follows Tesla knows well. Musk has always been exceptional at vision and ambitious announcements. His track record of hitting specific timelines is a little less consistent. The Roadster is still not in production. Full self-driving has been coming next year for years. The semi has also taken far longer than initially projected. Dan Ives acknowledges this, but makes a crucial distinction. When you're solving full self-driving, you're dealing with human lives. You cannot ship a product that is 99% reliable when the 1% means potential fatalities. The safety requirements create a different kind of development timeline than building a new car model. Hardware delays are engineering problems with known solutions. AI development for life safety applications is fundamentally less predictable because you're trying to solve problems that have never been solved before. This can be compared to SpaceX. Timeline slipped, rockets blew up, but the underlying technology kept advancing and eventually SpaceX achieved what most people thought was impossible. Reusable orbital rockets, regular crude missions, dominant market position in commercial launch. The delays didn't mean the thesis was wrong. They meant the problem was hard. The same logic applies to autonomous driving. The delays don't indicate Tesla can't solve it. They indicate the problem is genuinely difficult. >> We all kind of know the saying it's follow the money, but really, you know, I just talked about management and founders. It should be more like follow the money maker. And in that case, really, there's never been a greater money maker. Uh certainly on a on a on a nominal basis than Elon Musk. Listen, this is not a good picture. We should have had him here with a bow tie, you know. Let's let's fix this picture up, folks. Come on. Okay, Elon Musk. The question is, how can you ride his coat house? I want to bring in Entrepreneur Shares LLC COO Ava Anos. All right, Ava. So, let's talk about this because now it's official. $1.5 trillion. That's the valuation for SpaceX. People are clamoring. There's rumors a IPO any moment now. Talk to us about this. First of all, I agree Elon Musk is the greatest entrepreneur perhaps of all time and that's why we're heavily invested in Xov primarily because of him. Secondly, I'll do the math for the uh 1.5 uh billion. The reason a trillion the reason is that uh first of all it's not a tech play. This is an infrastructure play and infrastructure plays have big multiples because they have monopolistic characteristics. Secondly, the main cash cow is Starling. And again, I'm not taking this lightly. This is an ambitious valuation, but you can, it is doable, right? Starling is charging $500 per user, and they have 4 million uh subscribers right now. They're shooting for 40 million in the next two years. That's two billion right there. Then you have aviation contracts, you have maritime contracts, you have other governmental contracts accounting to 40 to 60 billion. that is that is on top of it 8 to 12 times multiple because of the category where it is and then the margin is 60% margin it's an extraordinary high margin so the valuation I believe is doable again we don't know but it is as a an analyst I'm taking it lightly I can't take it lightly but it is doable >> it is doable and then you've got things like the the race to get data centers into space you know I think it's so I when I see these small towns in America voting not to have data centers I'm like Oh god, you're going to regret it. You're going to regret it because then they'll have this space one day. You'll say, \"How come they don't have that down here?\" Uh these are just some of the other offshoots that there's so many opportunities out of this. Right. >> Exactly. And it's vertically integrated. So it's everything. And Starling is right now covering 100% of the planet and it's going against the most bureaucratic companies, the telecom companies who are have a high marginal cost to serve the remote user. That's where Starling is coming cuz their their cost of serving the marginal user is minimum. They have no poles, no wires, nothing. >> Eva makes a distinction that completely changes how you should think about SpaceX's valuation. SpaceX should be valued as an infrastructure company. That single word difference explains why the valuation makes sense when traditional tech metrics say it shouldn't. EVA states directly that SpaceX is an infrastructure play. infrastructure businesses get bigger multiples because they have monopoly characteristics. Eva identifies Starlink as the main cash cow and points to the extraordinarily high margins and emphasizes the vertical integration. SpaceX controls everything and Eva highlights why Starink beats traditional telecoms. No poles, no wires, nothing. The cost of serving each additional user is marginal while incumbents face high marginal costs to reach remote users. Tech companies get valued on growth rates and margins. Can they grow revenue quickly? Can they maintain margins as they scale? The best tech companies trade at high multiples because they grow fast and operate with software economics where each additional customer costs almost nothing to serve. Infrastructure companies get valued differently. Growth matters, but what really drives value is the durability and defensibility. Can competitors realistically replicate what you've built? How long will your advantage last? What would it cost to have someone build an alternative? Railroads in the 1800s became the dominant infrastructure investments of that era because once you laid down track between two cities, no one was going to build a second set of rails right next to yours. The economics didn't support it. One railroad connecting two points was usually enough. This gave railroad owners pricing power and predictable cash flows for decades. Telecom networks in the 1900s followed the same pattern. Once AT&T strung telephone wires to every home in America, building a competing network of wires to those same homes was economically irrational. The infrastructure incumbent had a natural monopoly. Regulators eventually forced changes, but for most of the century, telecom infrastructure meant guaranteed profits. Cloud computing represents a modern version. AWS services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud, they are more than just software products. their physical infrastructure. Massive data centers filled with servers connected by high-speed networks distributed globally. Building a competing cloud infrastructure from scratch would cost tens of billions of dollars and take years. The big three have effectively locked up the market. SpaceX with Starlink is making the same play, but in orbit. Traditional satellite internet existed before Starlink, but it was terrible. Very high latency because satellites sat in distant orbits. limited bandwidth because each satellite covered huge areas. Expensive because launch costs made putting satellites up very costly. Starlink changed every part of that equation. SpaceX's reusable rockets/launch costs instead of treating each rocket as disposable. They can land and refly them. This isn't a marginal improvement. It's a fundamental restructuring of the economics of reaching orbit. With cheaper launches, SpaceX could afford to put up far more satellites than any previous constellation. And they designed those satellites to operate in low Earth orbit, much closer to the surface than traditional communication satellites. Closer satellites means lower latency. Lower latency means Starink can compete with groundbased internet on speed, not just availability. The constellation now covers basically the entire planet. No poles, no wires, no digging trenches or stringing cables. Just a dish that points to the sky. This is where Eva's point about marginal cost becomes devastating for competitors. When a traditional telecom company wants to serve a new customer, they face real costs. If that customer lives in a city with existing infrastructure, the cost is manageable. Maybe running a line from the street to the house. If that customer lives in a rural area without existing infrastructure, the cost becomes substantial. Running fiber or cable miles from the nearest node requires physical construction, trucks, workers, permits, and time. The more remote the customer, the higher the cost to serve them.
