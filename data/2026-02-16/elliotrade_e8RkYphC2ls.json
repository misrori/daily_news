    "transcript": "Yeah.   Hey. Hey.   Heat.   Heat.   Heat.   Heat.   Heat.   Heat.   Hey,   hey,   hey.   Heat.   Hey. Hey. Hey.   Three,  two,  one.   What  is  going  on  everybody  and  welcome   to  today's  episode.  And  before  we  get   crazy  and  start  talking  about  exactly  my   plan  to  buy  the  bottom  here  in  crypto   and  ride  it  up  or  hopefully  some  Jenny   wealth  as  we're  all  hoping  to  extract   here  over  the  next  few  years.  I  wanted   to  cover  something  because  I  promised   you  we  would  be  continuing  the   development  work  here  at  Supernova,  the   team  behind  Black  Hole,  uh  which  is  an   absolutely  insane  team.  I've  never  seen   a  harder  working  team.  They  are  ready  to   drop  Supernova.  And  there  is  your  chance   here.  Here  is  a  tweet  at  x.comrades.   If  you're  not  following  me  over  there,   leotrades  onx.  Um  $5,000  to  five   winners.  So  you  have  a  chance  to  get  a   little  bit  of  a  bare  market  treat.  They   say  there's  no  free  lunch,  but  in  the   bare  market  for  five  of  you,  there  will   be  a  free  lunch.  There  will  be  some   chicken  tendies  for  you  all.  So  I  hope   you  enjoy  this.  I  hope  you  enjoy  this   video,  which  we  put  some  nice  effort   into.  And  if  you  could  do  yourself  a   favor,  go  over  to  follow  Supernova  at   Supernova.  Uh  that'll  be  key  to  uh   getting  in  and  winning  the  giveaway,  but   also  do  yourself  a  little  extra  favor   and,  you  know,  read  through  the  docs.   There's  been  a  lot  a  lot  of  work  that's   gone  on  here.  Uh  so  read  through  the   documentation,  the  white  paper,  and   check  it  out  for  yourself.  Not  going to   be  talking  about  that  here  too  much.  And   with  that  said,  let's  jump  into  the  main   part  of  the  show  because  right  now,   let's  just  be  honest.  You  know,  things   are  a  little  boring.  things  are  a  little   boring  here  in  Bitcoin  land.  Uh,  and  if   we  bring  up  just  the  Bitcoin  chart,  you   can  see  that  since  uh  the  cascade   happened  a  few  days  ago,  we  brought  this   up  and  said,  you  know what,  after  this   sort  of  spring  that  we  saw,  it  feels   like  we're  going  to  be  seeing  quite  a   bit  of  chop.  Now,  the  chop  I  outlined,   the  high  of  the  range  is  80K,  the  low  of   the  range  is  60K.  And  between  there,   there's  just  not  a  lot  of  actionable   data.  We  could  easily  get  up  into  this   range  and  it  still  wouldn't  mean  it's  a   bull  market.  and  we  could  easily  come   down  here  and  it  wouldn't  mean  that   anything's  fundamentally  changed.  I   would  say  that  my  expectation  right  now   is  that  we  see  more  chop.  Uh  but  I'  I'd   like  to  see  I'd  really  like  to  see  a   nice  strong  girthy  bull  market  rally.   I'd  like  to  see  the  kind  of  bull  market   rally  that  really  knocks  the  bears  right   in  the  face.  All  the  people  who  just   think  it's  so  easy  to  short  Bitcoin,   it's  so  easy  to  make  money  on  the  way   down.  Well,  they  need  to  get  punched  in   the  mouth  and  then  we  potentially  get  uh   the  path  down  to  the  ultimate  lows.  So,   that's  kind  of  where  my  head's  at  right   now  is  that  I'm  expecting  some  kind  of   push  up  here.  I  don't  know  when  it'll   be,  how  strong  it'll  be.  I  could  tell   you  that  if  we  don't  get  that,  if  we   don't  get  that,  it  is  absolutely  bad.  It   is  absolutely  bad.  Okay,  if  we  don't  get   that,  so  just  categorically,  we  want  to   see  some  kind  of  bare  market  rally.  Bare   market  rallies  are  a  normal  part  of  the   evolution  of  the  market.  I  will  say  that   people  are  comparing  a  lot  of  this   current  drop  to  prior  drops  and  saying   that  prior  drops  dropped  on  a  percentage   basis  farther  from  the  top.  But  you  have   to  consider  that  we  actually  didn't  go   as  high  above  the  prior  market  cycle  top   as  last  cycles.  If  you  look  here  um  we   only  made  it  above  the  prior  market   cycle  top  uh  which  was  69,000.  We  only   made  it  about  83%  up.  We  didn't  even   double  the  last  prior  market  cycle  top.   Whereas  the  market  cycle  before  that,   which  was  uh  actually  we  got  to  go  a   little  further  back.  I  get  get  out  the   weekly.  The  market  cycle  before  that,  we   saw  uh  Bitcoin  actually  put  in  a   significant  uh  235%   uh  gain.  So  uh  almost  a  4x  3  and  a  halfx   here  roughly  um  over  the  prior  cycle's   all-time  high.  And  of  course  the  one   before  that  you  know  topped  out  at  about   uh  1100  I  believe  was  was  the  number.  So   we  had  uh  or  1300.  So  we  ended  up  seeing   that  was  like,  you  know,  15x.  Insane.   Insane.  So  even  though  it  might  be  on   track  in  that  how  much  it's  fallen  from   the  peak  to  where  it's  at  roughly  50%   around  these  first  few  weeks,  it  still   feels  much  worse.  It  feels  much  worse   and  much  faster  because  we've  reached   really  important  levels  like  the  200E   moving  average,  uh,  which  we  pretty  much   almost  touch  within  spinning  distance,   which  is  usually  an  indicator  of  where   the  bare  markets  may  bottom.  not   guaranteed  to  bottom,  but  may  bottom.   And  so  this  is  where  people  feel  a  lot   worse  this  time  and  why  people  are   wondering  if  things  are  just  contracted,   if  things  are  going  faster,  but  that  we   will  ultimately  reach  our  low  point   faster.  And  I  think  that  the  important   part  here  is  to  know  that  whenever  it   does  happen,  we  will  be  covering  it   every  single  moment  of  it.  And  in  order   to  make  sure  that  you  are  with  us  each   and  every  step  of  the  way  with  our  new   trading  system,  which  has  kept  us  safe   since  the  90  high  $90,000  retest  here,   which  is  when,  of  course,  we  did  our   housekeeping  zone.  Please  like  and   subscribe.  Make  sure  you  have  the   notification  bell  on.  YouTube  has  not   been  kind  to  crypto  channels  over  the   last  few  months.  It's  been  an  extreme   lack  of  momentum.  So,  each  like,  each   comment,  each  uh  subscription  or   resubscribe  really  helps  the  channel.   And  we  want  to  make  sure  that  people   know  about  our  little  industry  here   because  there  is  a  lot  to  be  excited   about  and  we  have  been  flushing  out  a   lot  of  the  nonsense  and  hopefully  we   will  get  a  very  strong  industry  on  the   other  side  of  this.  That's  the  hope,   right?  Is  we're  no  longer  saying,  hey,   let's  avoid,  you  know,  the  goal  here   isn't  to  say,  hey,  let's  avoid  the  pain.   We're  here.  We're  in  the  pain.  The  goal   now  is  to  say  on  the  other  side  of  this   pain  we're  going  through  as  an  industry,   let's  make  sure  that  we  emerge   victorious.  That  is  the  key.  And  in  the   meantime,  let's  take  all  of  our  skills   that  we've  amassed  here  in  cryptoland   and  let's  try  to  become  the  best   investors  and  make  the  most  money   possible.  And  I'll  be  honest,  looking  at   the  tape  right  now,  looking  at  all   markets  right  now,  it's  extremely   boring.  You  have  gold  has  pretty  much   just  been  in  this  this  range  trying  to   figure  it  out.  Let  me  let  me  go  to  the   hourly.  Gold  has  just  been  ranging  here.   You  know,  it's  kind  of  doing  this  like   upward  sloping  triangle.  It's  unclear.   Gold  could  easily,  you  know,  bust  up   here  and  then  it's  interesting  again  or   it  could  break  down  here,  you  know,   especially  if  it  goes  below  this  43  and   then,  you  know,  it  could  be  boring  for  a   very  long  time.  B,  gold  can  be  boring   for  decades,  right?  Uh,  silver  looks   quite  broken,  but,  you  know,  just  not   that  interesting.  Uh,  copper  is  still   hanging  around  the  highs  of  the  metals,   the  most  interesting  to  me,  and  we'll   talk  a  little  bit  about  that  this   episode,  but  just  overall  equities,   crypto,  there's  just  not  too  much  action   happening  right  now  in  the  space.  Little   bit  of  relief  bounces  here  on  alts,  but   not  much  to  talk  about.  And  so,  let's   talk  instead  about  some  long-term  some   long-term  analysis  of  what's  happening   with  Bitcoin  with  the  macro  because  this   is  how  we  can  start  understanding  where   we  can  buy  the  bottom  because  that  is  my   goal.  That  should  be  all  of  our  goals.   And  again,  the  bottom  is,  you  know,  a   mythical  thing.  Some  people  will  buy  it   perfectly  and  we'll  brag  about  it,  but   we  just  want  to  be  directionally  right   when  we've  reached  a  terminal  velocity   of  the  bare  market  and  when  it's  good  to   accumulate.  It's  not  about  getting  it   perfect.  We  want  to  get  it  like  80%   right.  And  we  did  that  last  cycle.  We   bought  under  20K,  which  was  within   spitting  distance  of  the  bottom.  We   didn't  load  up  the  truck  at  16K.  We   didn't,  you  know,  snipe  the  pico  bottom.   But  we  were  able  to  realize  when  the   trend  changed  and  we  caught  the  absolute   majority  of  the  move.  And  we  ultimately   said,  \"Okay,  let's  get  out  here  around   98K.\"  The  biggest  biggest  issue  was  that   we  did  not  uh  take  accurately  enough  and   with  urgency  enough  the  change  in  weekly   trend  on  alts.  We're  not  going  to  let   that  happen  again.  So,  what  you're   looking  at  right  now  is  the  uh  WLCL.   This  is  the  balance  sheet.  This  is  USA's   balance  sheet,  right?  And  what  we  know   is  that  we've  been  waiting  for  this   thing  to  start  going  up  again  because  we   believe  that  more  liquidity  will  be  good   for  our  bags.  And  if  you'll  see  here,  if   you'll  zoom  in,  I'm  going to  go  ahead   and  hide  this  other  line.  It's  a  little   confusing.  You'll  see  this  blue  line  has   now  started  on  a  weekly  time  basis   making  a  bullish  chart  where  it  came  up,   it  came  back,  and  it's  retesting  higher.   And  of  course,  if  we  break  above  this   line  right  here,  we  will  now  start   forming  a  proper  uptrend,  which  we  have   not  seen,  which  we  have  not  seen  happen   since  this  point,  exactly  this  point  in   2019.  And  what  might  surprise  you  or   what  what  might  not  surprise  you  rather   is  to  learn  that  this  was  also  a  bare   market.  And  in  fact,  um  as  as  some  other   commentators  have  deemed  it  right  after   a  top  on  apathy,  right?  a  non-f  fun,   non-uporic  top  where  Bitcoin  topped  when   there  wasn't  really  much  going  on.  And   so  you  have  essentially  Bitcoin  already   in  a  downtrend  which  was  started  in  June   and  then  the  balance  sheet  started   expanding  in  September.  We  have   something  kind  of  similar,  right,  where   Bitcoin  topped  here  in  October  and  then   the  balance  sheet  started  uh  expanding   here  in  December  and  you  have  a  few   month  lag  there.  And  then  the  question   is  how  long  did  it  take  for  Bitcoin  to   start  going  up  again  after  that  balance   sheet  expanded?  And  I  can  show  it  for   you  right  here.  I  have  it  demarcated.  It   was  26  weeks,  effectively  six  months   where  you  can  see  all  of  a  sudden  uh   Bitcoin's  price  started  reliably  uh   bottoming  here  and  then  going  up,  right?   And  we  know  that  the  balance  sheet   expanded  very  drastically  here.  So  we're   not  expecting  that,  but  we're  just   trying  to  get  some  historical  correlary.   What  can  history  teach  us  about  this   moment?  And  this  is  just  one.  So,  I've   demarcated  the  same  gap,  the  same  26  bar   gap  here,  which  would  give  us  an   ultimate  um  resolution  price  for  when  we   can  expect  the  breakout  or  the  bottom  of   Bitcoin  against  this  increasing   liquidity  trend  of  June  2026.  626,  baby.   Um,  so  that's  where  we're  looking  at  if   history  repeats.  Again,  I  don't  think   history  should  be  taken  as  gospel,  but   let  me  actually  paint  for  you  a  couple   of  pretty  interesting  points  here   because  Kevin  Walsh,  the  new  Fed  chair,   takes  office  in  May.  his  first  address   where  we'll  actually  know  what  he's   going  to  be  doing  when  he's  addressing   the  nation  is  in  June.  So,  we  have  this   regime  change  on  the  Federal  Reserve   side  and  on  the  macro  liquidity  side   happening  right  as  this  sort  of  I  guess   woo  woo  historical  astronomical  uh  you   know  pattern  matching  and  Bitcoin  does   tend  to  match  patterns  if  not   specifically  the  pattern  on  the  shape.   It  matches  the  pattern  on  time  really   well.  the  four-year  cycle,  you  know,  day   to  top  and  to  the  day  the  bottom  has   been  pretty  accurate  time-wise.  So,  if   we  are  to  match  the  time  here  between   the  increase  in  balance  sheet  and  the   actual  increase  in  price  of  Bitcoin,   that  gets  us  June.  That's  also  when   we'll  hear  from  Kevin  Walsh  for  the   first  time  as  Fed  share.  And  you  just   start  to  see  things  lining  up.  Now,   maybe  none  of  them  in  and  of  themselves   are  going  to  cause  the  next  bull  run  or   be  the  the  spark  that  lights  the  the   France  Ferdinand  match  that  sets  off  a   chain  of  reaction.  This  is  just   interesting  information.  And  so  June  26   or  June  2026  is  an  interesting  time   where  the  bottom  may  very  likely  start   emerging  between  May  and  October  is  kind   of  the  range.  But  here  we're  giving  you   yet  another  data  point  that  you  can  use   to  potentially  help  you  time  that   bottom.  Now  remember  what  I  told  you  the   ultimate  the  ultimate  indicator  in  all   of  this  is  price.  So  we  will  be  matching   our  basic  our  bias  matching  our   macroeconomic  data,  our  forecasting,  our   fundamental  data  against  price.  And  when   we  look  at  the  price,  what  we  can  see  is   that,  you  know,  Bitcoin  has  not  really   done  much  since  it  kind  of  had  this   spring  moment  here  back  in  um  on   Thursday  the  5th.  It's  kind  of  chopped.   It  failed  to  get  above  this  72K  level.   It  it  really  didn't  get  above  the  72K   level  at  all,  which  was  the  first  major   level.  there's  this  kind  of  chewy  area   between  72  and  74  and  it's  just  kind  of   rolled  over  and  then  it  came  up  and  it   started  rolling  over  again  and  it  didn't   even  make  it  up  to  these  prior  highs.   So,  still  very  anemic.  Like,  if  we're   being  very  objective  here,  the  Bitcoin   price  is  still  anemic.  And  I  want  to   underscore  a  couple  of  things.  The  first   thing  is  that  the  goal  of  this  channel   will  not  just  be  to  simply  hold  and   pray.  We  will  be  looking  to  make  money   on  trends  when  they  emerge.  Right  now,   the  big  trend  from  Bitcoin  coming  from   96K  all  the  way  down  to  60K.  That  was  a   massive  asymmetric  move  and  we're   probably  just  going  to  get  a  bunch  of   chop  at  least  for  the  next  few  weeks.  I   wouldn't  be  expecting  dramatic  moves   unless,  for  example,  the  S&P  started,   you  know,  completely  falling  through,   you  know,  falling  into  freef  fall.  And   I'm  not  expecting  that.  It's  very  hard   to  time  those  things.  So,  uh,  I'm  not   expecting  much.  I'm  expecting  a  little   bit  of  a  period  of  boring,  of  chop,  of   sideways.  And  in  this  time,  if  you're   not  already  employing  a  different   strategy  and  you're  wanting  to  get  more   active  with  your  strategies,  it's  a  good   time  to  learn.  Uh  so  with  that  said,  I   wanted  to  just  bring  this  up.  The   balance  sheet  is  durably  expanding  for   the  first  time  in  uh  really  almost  7   years,  right?  So  this  happened  in  uh  the   9th  of  September  2019.  So  6  and  1/2   years  uh  since  we've  seen  something  like   this  happen.  It  is  a  big  deal.  It  is  a   massive  deal.  It  is  a  sea  change,  but  we   still  don't  want  to  front  run  and  get   too  over  our  skis  until  we  start  seeing   the  market  react.  I  think  that  that's   the  key  is  that  you  want  to  take  the   fundamental  analysis  and  combine  it  with   price  analysis.  That's  going  to  be  the   key  here.  But  I  did  want  to  bring  this   up  because  we're  starting  to  see  an   absolute  smattering  of  extreme  bullish   announcements  in  my  opinion.  Something   like  this  with  actual  stock  and  crypto   trading  on  X  itself  could  potentially  be   the  biggest  financial  app  we've  ever   seen.  I  know  if  you  guys  have,  maybe   some  of  you  haven't  done  this,  but  if   you're  messing  with  the  AI  tooling,  a   lot  of  people  like  to  take  AI  bots  and   point  it  at  Twitter  and  have  it  trade   based  on  sentiment.  This  is  a  very   common  thing  to  do.  And  if  you  could   actually  have  the  features  built   directly  into  Twitter,  you  wouldn't  need   to  kind  of  hack  together  these  toolkits.   I  think  that  Twitter  could  create  one  of   the  most  vibrant  and  exciting  trading   communities  that  we've  ever  seen  because   that  really  is  the  trading  community.   The  financial  community  is  on  X.  So  the   features  that  are  possible  with   something  like  crypto  trading  and  stock   trading  directly  on  X  would  be   absolutely  insane.  It  would  be  insane   and  it  would  be  both  chaotic  as  well  as   open  up  different  avenues  for   monetization  for  exchanges.  I  think  they   would  have  an  advantage  over  traditional   exchanges  like  Coinbase,  like  Robin   Hood.  So,  this  is  huge.  And  I  also  think   that  it  will  help  bring  in  more   audiences  to  crypto  in  potentially  a   more  sustainable  way  if  the  best  traders   were  socially  verifiably  proven  on  chain   to  have  that  those  chops  and  to  be  able   to  say,  \"Oh,  well,  here  was  my  P&L  last   week.  Here  was  my  P&L.\"  Instead,  right   now,  it's  sort  of  a  social  uh  trust  me,   trust  me,  bro  type  situation  where  a  lot   of,  you  know,  a  lot  of  content  creators,   we  don't  know  their  P&L,  right?  And   there's  always,  you  know,  questions  as   to  whether  they're  photoshopping  their   P&L.  There  could  be  a  way  where  you   could  verify  your  P&L  directly  on  X.  And   I  think  that  that  could  be  really   interesting  as  a  way  to  know  whose   signal  and  whose  noise.  I  think  it  could   bring  in  a  whole  new  era  of  trading.  And   I'm  here  for  it.  I'm  here  for  it.  I   think  this  industry  needs  to  take  these   times  of  pain  and  try  to  emerge  not  just   saying,  \"Hey,  how  fast  can  we  get  out  of   this  period  of  pain,  but  how  reliably   can  we  get  out  of  this  period  of  pain  so   that  the  next  era  is  one  of  just  a   four-year  cycle  that  I  would  argue   brought  very  little  to  the  table  in   terms  of  moving  crypto  forward.  The   actual  moves  we  saw  for  crypto  in  2020   and  2021  were  astronomically  big   compared  to  what  we  saw  in  2023  and   2024,  which  were  mostly  regulatory   changes.  And  we  still  haven't  even   gotten  market  structure.  So  stuff  like   this  gets  me  really  excited.  I  think   that  X  could  become  the  financial  hub  of   the  online  world  if  it  succeeds  in   nailing  the  exchange  portion  of  this   product  offering.  This  this  would  be  the   absolute  crux  to  have  the  best  trading   experience  and  they  could  do  all  kinds   of  social  features.  So  this  is  B  very   bullish.  Not  in  the  kind  of  thing  where   it's  going  to  send  our  bags  up   overnight,  but  I  think  this  is  bullish   for  accessibility  to  crypto  overall  and   and  that's  just  something  that  I  think   we  should  all  marinate  on.  We  also  are   looking  at  potentially  more  instability.   I'm  not  sure  how  this  will  impact  our   bags,  but  in  a  weak  market,  this  could   lead  to  some  pretty  nasty  candles.   Though  what  we  have  seen  is  that  over   time,  usually  these  types  of  conflicts   lead  to,  you  know,  asset  prices  going   up.  It's  just  the  truth  of  it,  right?   These  types  of  military  conflicts  will   inevitably  drive  prices  up  because  the   expectation  is  that  governments  borrow   more  money  and  that  they  essentially   need  to  finance  the  debt  that  they  spend   on  stuff  like  this  and  that  usually   leads  to  much  higher  prices.  So,  you   know,  it  feels  sometimes  pretty  sad  to   look  at  an  announcement  like  this  where   you  know  there's  going to  be  human   suffering  and  say,  well,  I  think  this  is   good  for  the  bags.  But  it's  just  been   proven  over  time  that  wars  and  hot   conflicts  tend  to  be  bullish  for   markets.  If  you  look  at  the  stock   markets  of  various  countries  that  have   just  had  military  conflicts,  boom,   there's  there's  your  proof  right  there.   It's  actually  insane.   Now,  to  an  interesting  piece  of  data   here.  I  wanted  to  bring  this  up  to  you.   So,  I've  been  talking  a  lot  about  copper   over  the  last  few  episodes,  and  that's   because  right  now,  if  you're  not  living   under  a  rock,  you've  seen  the   advancement  in  AI  that  has  been   mind-blowing.  It's  very  obvious  that  the   next  era  for  AI  is  going  to  be   bottlenecked  by  energy.  And  so  many   people  think  that  the  actual  source  of   energy,  the  ultimate  source  of  energy   will  be  renewables,  will  be  solar.   That's,  you  know,  people  much  smarter   than  me,  people  who  know  much  more  about   the  energy  business  than  me  believe  it's   solar  and  that  nuclear  will  act  as  a   decent  stop  gap,  but  it  cannot  cover  it   all.  It's  just  way  too  hard  to  scale   nuclear  that  fast.  However,  solar  has   crashed  in  the  amount  of  cost  it  takes   to  produce  energy  by  something  like   99.9%  over  the  last  few  decades.  And  so,   a  lot  of  people  believe  solar  is  the   bottleneck.  So,  with  that  in  mind,  what   you  need  for  solar  is  copper.  And   copper,  my  friends,  is  completely   impossible  to  get  right  now  because   there's  been  an  absolute  underinvestment   into  copper  mining  over  the  past  few   decades.  Let's  listen  to  this  guy  talk   about  uh  copper.  Check  Check  out  this   clip.   Yeah,  he's  essentially  saying  that  the   amount  of  copper  we've  mined  in  human   history,  right,  in  human  history,  we   need  to  mine  the  same  amount  in  the  next   decade  or  so.  Okay.  And  one  thing  that   I've  also  discovered  is  that  effectively   the  mining  industry  as  percent  of  global   equities  is  at  the  lowest  it  has  ever   been  on  record  since  1900.  Right.  Since   1900.  So  this  is  crazy,  right?  This  is   um  Yeah,  I  live  in  the  mine,  too.  No   audio.  Wait,  so  you  guys  didn't  hear   that  audio?  Can't  hear.  Can't  hear.  Um   okay.  Well,  it  it  was  it  was  playing  on   my  side.  Um  and  it  was  showing  that  it   was  playing.  Let  me  go  ahead  and  ensure   that's  true.  If  it  if  it  doesn't  play,   I'll  try  again.  But  the  point  of  this  is   he's  just  saying  copper  is  extremely   scarce.  And  I  will  just  explain  what  he   said.  He  essentially  said  that   everything  we  need  as  far  as  a  modern   military,  uh,  electric  vehicles,  and  of   course,  the  AI  bottlenecks  around  energy   are  going  to  be  solved  through  mining   copper.  Okay.  Uh,  yeah.  So,  somebody   heard  it.  Yeah,  maybe  it  was  just  too   soft.  My  bad.  My  bad.  Regardless,  this   is  the  green  metal,  right?  This  is  the   metal  that  you  need  for  an  expanding   economy.  And  essentially  for  the  next   several  decades,  there  is  a  shortage.   There  is  a  massive  shortage  projected  on   copper.  Combine  this  with  the  fact  that   it's  been  underinvested  into.  And  you   also  combine  this  with  something  I   brought  up  last  video,  which  is  that   when  you  combine  the  new  spike  up  in   ISM,  let  me  actually  bring  this  up  for   you.  When  you  combine  the  new  spike  up   in  ISM  that  we've  just  had  here,  uh  here   the  USB  COI,  this  is  the  ISM,  right?   Okay.  And  we've  already  shown  that  ISM   correlates  heavily  with  Bitcoin  doing   well.  What  you  can  see  here  is  that  ISM   had  this  prolonged  period  under  50.  And   that  is  very  unnatural  for  the  ISM.  It's   very  unnatural.  Let  me  go  ahead  and  do   regular.  Under  50  is  usually  considered   recessionary.  Um,  let  me  get  it  more   accurate.  Under  50  is  considered   recessionary.  And  what  you'll  see  here   is  that  usually  the  ISM  only  stays  under   50  for  a  short  period  of  time.  Uh,  in   this  case,  where  is  this?  In  this  case,   where's  my  brush?   Where's  my  brush?  Okay,  I  don't  know   where  my  brush  went.  Oh,  there  it  is.  Oh   my  god.  Get  out  of  this.  Okay,  as  you   can  see,  it  usually  only  stays  under   this  was  like  a  very  long  period  of  time   and  it  was  after  the  dot  crash.  We  can   see  here  uh  during  the  GFC,  the  great   financial  crisis,  we  were  only  under  it   from  February  08  till  August  09.  So  way   less  time  than  we've  been  under  it  here   where  we've  been  under  it  for  like  four   years.  So  again,  we've  gone  over  this   several  times.  We  usually  don't  spend   that  much  time  under  the  under  the  50   mark  for  the  ISM.  Certainly  not  since   Bitcoin  has  been  alive.  So  this  is  a   prolonged  period  of  contraction  in  the   economy.  And  what  we're  seeing  now  is   that  we've  seen  an  explosion  of  ISM  and   we  also  saw  a  reaceleration  of  jobs  data   as  well  as  freight  data  and  uh  faile   over  here.  Um,   Xiao  over  here  put  out  a  video  which  I   think  you  guys  should  check  out.  I  don't   know  which  one  it  is,  but  he  essentially   showed  that  the  um,   where  was  this?  I  think  it  was  lost.  I   think  it  was  mixed  up  in  his  video,  but   I  showed  it.  Essentially,  he  had  the  AI   calculate  which  assets  would  do  best   when  you  have  this  influx  or  you  have   this  pivot  of  the  acceleration  of  the   ISM  as  well  as  jobs  data.  and  he  said   essentially  copper  is  the  big  winner  and   it's  set  to  grow  on  average  over  80%  in   the  following  year.  I  think  that  that  is   a  world  that  is  without  AI  without  these   new  defense  military  contracting  world.   We  know that  the  US  military  has  been   expanding  aggressively.  We  know  that  it   wants  another  500  billion  per  year  um   and  that's  what's  been  proposed  by  this   presidential  administration.  there  is  a   massive  shortage  of  copper  and  so  I'm   very  excited  about  copper  as  a  narrative   as  to  where  to  invest  and  theoretically   if  you  sort  of  take  it  to  its  maximum   that  AI  is  going  to  take  everything  that   can  be  created  in  the  world  of  code  and   make  it  really  easy  to  massproduce  make   it  almost  effortless  to  create  like  the   world  of  bits  or  code  sort  of  on  the   margins  goes  down  because  there's  less   of  a  reason  to  pay  a  premium  for  it   whereas  the  world  of  atoms  stuff  that   you  cannot  you  know  claw  code  stuff  that   you  cannot  just  use  AI  to  duplicate  goes   up.  So  there's  this  trade  that's  being   called  the  bits  to  atoms  trade  and  I   believe  it  is  very  early  in  the  bits  to   atoms  trade.  I  am  extremely  excited   about  what  it  means  for  robotics  which   cannot  be  cloudcoded  away  and  I'm   extremely  excited  what  it  means  for  our   world  because  it's  going  to  open  up  all   kinds  of  investment  opportunities.  So  um   the  world  is  a  little  boring  right  now   but  I  am  very  excited  very  excited  about   uh  what  the  copper  thesis  looks  like  and   it's  just  something  that  I  think  you   should  have  on  your  radar  um  along  with   uranium.  Uranium  is  part  of  the  nuclear   energy  uh  world  too.  So  uranium  and   copper  are  very  interesting.  Um  let's   get  into   we  have  our  first  instance  according  to   Quinn  Thompson  here.  He  is  also  on  the   forward  guidance  podcast  of  Fred  Treasur   Fed  Treasury  coordination.  And  what  he   argues  in  this  article  is  effectively  um   I'm  just  going  to  get  you  to  the  summary   of the  punch  line  here.  The  bull  case   for  go  gold  gold  is  unlikely  to  go  away   anytime  soon.  We  have  a  stock  market  at   all-time  highs  and  unemployment  rate   below  4.5%.  Yet  the  government  has   resided  restarted  quantitative  easing  to   support  the  bond  market  again  without   any  crisis  type  event.  So  again,  usually   quantitative  easing  is  in  response  to   mega  crises  whether  it's  the  great   financial  crisis  or  uh  in  2020  the   virus.  And  so  what  he's  saying  is  this   is  a  this  is  February  of  a  high  stakes   midterm  election  with  even  more   consolidation  of  power  occurring  in  the   coming  months  with  Kevin  Walsh  taking   office.  Do  you  think  this  type  of   behavior  is  going  to  increase  or   decrease?  He's  essentially  saying  the   bull  case  for  currency  devaluation  the   debasement  trade  is  back.  And  I  think   that  this  is  one  what  you  will  see  and   you  don't  even  need  to  know  any  of  this.   All  you  need  to  know  is  you  go  to  wall   and  you  track  this  one  metric,  right?   Which  is  is  the  money  supply  growing?  Is   is  the  Fed's  balance  sheet  growing?   Because  if  it  is,  then  that's  your  way   to  know  that  okay,  they  are  actually   stimulating  the  economy.  Again,  if  this   balance  sheet  number  goes  up,  WCL,  then   we  know  that  there's  more  money  being   sort  of  taken  out  of  the  markets  by  the   Feds  and  by  the  Federal  Reserve  and   that's  supporting  markets.  So,  usually   that  has  been  what's  caused  a  lot  of   assets  to  run.  So,  we  need  to  see  what   happens  here  because  there's  a  lot  of   rumors  that  Fed  uh  that  the  Fed  chair   Worsh  will  not  do  that.  So,  if  this  is   already  happening  and  we're  seeing  some   Fed  Treasury  uh  I  guess  cooperation  to   support  the  bond  market,  that  is  a  form   of  QE.  They  won't  call  it  QE,  but  it's  a   form  of  adding  support  to  markets  and  to   helping  boost  markets.  So,  if  we  see   that,  we  should  in  theory  see  it  be  very   good  for  our  bags.  But  I  also  think   these  things  take  a  while  to  really  kick   in  as  we've  seen  with  the  last  instances   of  um  quantitative  easing.  We  just  went   over  that  earlier  in  this  episode.  This   is  where  I  think  we  should  have  the   narrative,  but  also  just  be  tracking   price  for  how  we  make  our  entries  and   exits.  So  that  that's  the  way  I  think  we   should  be  uh  viewing  this  particular   event,  which  is  okay,  we're  now  starting   starting  to  see  signs  of  QE,  uh  but  we   haven't  gotten  the  full  cannon  yet,  and   we  should  just  be  tracking  its  effect  on   the  markets  and  also  understanding   there's  a  lag.  I  thought  this  was  crazy.   Apparently,  uh,  three  companies  make   nearly  all  the  RAM  in  the  world  and  two   of  them  in  Korea.  I  didn't  know  this,   but  apparently  Korea  are  the  high   priests  of  the  RAM  world.  And,  uh,  and   we  should  all  just  understand  we're   living  in  their  world.  Um,  I  asked  this   guy  Jorge  asked  what  Grock  is.  Ask  Grock   what  she's  talking  about.  Apparently,   the  three  companies  are  Samsung,  um,   Heinex,  and  Micron  Technology.  So,  you   know,  good  for  Korea  right  now.  Again,  I   think  the  biggest  trades  right  now  are   not  uh  AI  or  compute.  It's  the   bottlenecks.  It's  called  the  bottleneck   trade.  I  think  there's  even  a  bottleneck   ETF.  I'll  look  into  the  performance  of   that.  But  I  think  you're  sort  of  looking   at  for  those  people  who  didn't  buy   Nvidia  a  few  years  ago.  And  you  know,   Nvidia  seems  pretty  expensive  right  now.   I  think  looking  at  where  the  bottlenecks   are  for  not  just  if  Nvidia  is  the  big   winner,  but  for  all  AI,  what  it  needs.   And  I  think  we  should  also  be  looking  at   what  it  means  for  uh  humanoid  robots  and   different  types  of  embodied  AI  that  come   next  because  I  do  think  that  at  the   margins  it's  hard  to  see  one  company   winning  AI  when  you're  effectively   creating  intelligence  that  can  create   value  wherever  it  lives.  So  that's   something  I  just  think  it's  going  to  be   very  hard  for  anyone  to  rationalize,  you   know,  one  or  two  or  three  very  big   winners  that  don't  eventually  get   challenged  by  small  local  AIs  that  can   exist  and  create  value  for  the  economy   um  that  are  almost  as  good  as  those   premium  models.  I  think  those  premium   models  will  always  be  slightly  ahead.   But  the  question  is,  do  you  need  that   much  intelligence  for  every  task?  Most   people  the  answer  is  probably  no.  So,   um,  where  is  I  have  some  pretty  good   stuff  for  you  coming  up.  Oh,  yeah.  This   one.  Uh,  I  don't  know if  you  guys  know   this,  but  apparently  apparently  on  the   recent  All-In  podcast,  Chimath  did  a   little,  uh,  piece  where  he  essentially   said  that  they  were  discussing   prediction  markets  and  whether  or  not   there  is  the  need  for  regulation  to  keep   people  from  front  running  with  uh,   insider  information.  And  what  he  said  is   essentially  this  happened  in  the  stock   market  and  as  soon  as  it  happened,   Warren  Buffett's  returns  went  from   double  the  markets  to  being  even  less   than  the  market  return.  This  is  actually   a  crazy  one  and  it  shows  you  that  some   of  your  heroes,  some  of  the  best  and   the,  you  know,  the  brightest  of  all  time   were  just  exploiting  inefficiencies  in   the  markets  and  um  and  that's  how  a  lot   of  people  have  gotten  rich.  I  just   wanted  to  kind  of  react  to  this  one  with   you  guys.  So  it's  just  meant  to  explain   that  markets  thrive  when  there's   asymmetry.   Billions  and  billions  of  dollars  will  be   made  in  asymmetry.  The  prediction   markets  today  unless  they  are  regulated   out  of  existence  or  shut  down  will  look   like  the  stock  market  free prereg  FD  and   there's  nothing  we  can  do  except  choose   not  to  bet  it.   >> I  think  that's  directionally  true.  But  I   think  where  I  did  where  I  get  a  little   bit  of  I  have  a  little  bit  of  pause  with   this  because  I  think  there's  a  question   of  whether  or  not  prediction  markets   should  be  regulated  more.  I  think  that   right  now  under  this  administration  they   won't.  But  then  it  becomes  a  question  of   is  information  something  that  you  can  be   that  can  be  regulated?  Is  all   information  are  all  bets  something  that   should  be  regulated?  We're  definitely   going  to  grapple  with  these  concepts   right  now.  But  certainly  it's  kind  of   crazy  going  on  these  prediction  markets   and  seeing  that  there's  obvious  insider   betting  and  there's  one  wallet  that  that   will  take  a  position  of  multihundreds  of   thousands  right  before  the  resolution  of   the  market  itself.  Uh  it's  very   obviously  someone  with  knowledge  uh  that   is  not  something  that  the  general  public   has.  In  the  end  I  think  it's  very   interesting  to  find  out  that  some  of  the   best  investors  of  all  times  were   actually  exploiting  the  same   inefficiencies  within  their  time.  And  in   this  case,  it  was  Warren  Buffett  who  had   access  to  stock  information  before  the   rest  of  the  general  trading  public.  For   example,  Warren  Buffett  might  have  known   the  CTO  of  a  major  company  and  that   company  CTO  would  have  said,  \"Oh,  we  had   a  blockbuster,  you  know,  quarter  this   quarter  before  that  information  actually   comes  out,  he  would  get  a  little  tip  off   and  then  he'd  invest,  right?\"  And  so  he   could  beat  the  market.  So,  this  is  just   a  good  example  of  you  can't  blindly   follow  other  investors  because  you  don't   know  how  they  made  their  money.   Oftentimes,  some  investors  had  an  edge   that  you  just  didn't  know  about  or   didn't  exist  or  still  doesn't  exist   today  or  did  exist  then.  So,  it's  just   important  that  you  build  your  own   system.   Um,  obviously,  if  you  guys  have  been   following  not  under  a  rock,  we  had   another  big  Ray  Dallio  piece  where  he   essentially  said  the  world  order  has   broken  down.  Um,  really  long,  very   interesting  piece.  Obviously,  I'm  a  big   fan  of  Ray  Dalio.  I  think  he's  an   absolute  thug,  an  absolute  G.   Unfortunately,  I'm  not  sure  if  this  is   true.  I  think  that  the  reality  is  that   the  US  dollar  is  still  the  best  currency   and  that  is  the  arbiter  of  the  current   world  order.  We  saw  that  Russia  and   bricks  apparently  have  been  faltering   and  that  Russia  wants  to  come  back  and   start  using  dollars  again.  Whether  or   not  this  is  a  a  tactic,  I  have  no  idea.   I  don't  know  if  this  is  a  tactic.   However,  if  this  is  not  a  tactic  and   Russia  does  start  using  the  US  dollar   again,  then  the  world  order  isn't  broken   because  let's  be  honest,  the  world   doesn't  want  Chinese  yuan.  The  world   doesn't  want  um  you  know,  yen.  The  world   doesn't  want  any  other  currency.  It   wants  American  dollars.  It's  the  best  of   the  worst,  right?  It's  the  best  of  the   fiat  currencies.  And  so,  I  don't  think  I   fully  agree  with  this  whole  it's  over.   The  world  order  has  broken  down.  I  think   this  is  a  bit  doomer.  And  I  think  that   these  are  the  types  of  headlines  which   will  keep  you  from  making  in  my  opinion   smart  decisions  during  this  period.   Almost  every  great  investor  in  history   has  made  their  fortune  during  times  of   crisis.  Taking  a  time  of  crisis  like  the   crash  during  March  of  2020,  like  the   crash  that  we're  going  through  right   now,  like  periods  of  uncertainty  where   there  is  an  overreaction  by  markets  and   taking  advantage  and  having  a  clear   enough  head  to  see  where  the  resolutions   will  be.  That  is  how  you  make  the  most   money.  And  so  these  times  of  crisis  are   incredibly  incredibly  good  for  investors   who  understand  when  the  market  is   actually  overreacting.  So  that's  where  I   want  to  say  while  I  love  Ray  Dalio,  mad   respect,  I  don't  think  the  world  order   has  broken  down.  I  don't  believe  that's   true.  I  think  the  world  is  obviously   changing  and  is  much  more  hostile  than   it  was  maybe  10  years  ago.  But  to  say   that  it's  all  over  for  the  US  dollar  to   me  is  not  accurate.  And  I  don't  think   the  Western  world  is  on  the  brink  of   collapse  as  much  as  people  say.  I  think   the  Western  world  will  be  fine.   hot  take.  Maybe  that's  a  hot  take.   Anyway,  uh  if  you  guys  have  also  been   following  AI  news,  um  check  this  out.   This  guy  Peter  Sty  Steinberger,  he's  the   guy  who  created  Open  AI  or  Open  Claude,   he's  the  one  uh  who  created  the   Claudebot  sort  of  viral  moment  we've  had   today  or  over  the  last  few  weeks.  He   just  got  hired  by  Open  AI  as  a  senior  to   guide  over  their  agentic  product   offering.  So,  it  just  shows  like  if   you're  making  stuff  and  playing  around   with  AI,  you  could  end  up  getting  hired   by  Open  AI  and  God  knows  how  big  this   contract  was.  I  bet  it  was  at  least  $10   million  a  year.  Maybe  this  guy's  getting   paid  even  more.  Definitely  lifetime   generational  wealth  that  this  guy  just   secured  probably  with  this  contract.  So,   this  is  crazy.  Um,  and  I  thought  this   was  funny.  And  people  were  telling  him   to  cash  in  by  endorsing  a  memecoin,  lol.   Yeah.  I  mean,  if  you're  doing  the  I   think  the  purpose  of  crypto  in  2026   would  be  let's  not  try  to  rush  into   creating  valuations  that  go  up  because   that  didn't  work  so  well  for  us  over  the   last  few  years.  I  think  the  way  to  read   the  room  on  crypto  in  2026  is  to  simply   look  for  value.  the  most  compelling   buckets  and  narratives  of  value  that   make  sense  not  just  you  know  over  the   last  few  years  but  make  sense  in  the   context  of  AI  of  robotics  of  a  world   that's  less  trustworthy  of  of  each  other   of  a  world  that  has  real  conflict  of  a   world  where  there  is  all  these  changes   what  makes  sense  and  on  that  note  I   think  that  there  are  a  few  very  clear   buckets  that  make  tremendous  amounts  of   sense  the  first  one  is  I  saw  some   esports  tournament  in  Korea  where  it  was   effectively  kids  just  trading  crypto  and   leverage  trading  against  each  other.   There  is  no  greater  source  of  volatility   or  potential  sort  of  a  gauntlet  for   trading  for  entertainment  than  crypto.   So  I  think  crypto  trading  becoming  sort   of  like  an  esport  or  ingrained  in  the   increasingly  you  know  gambleobsessed   culture  of  today.  I  think  that  that's  a   real  area  in  which  crypto  will  have   staying  power.  I  think  that  privacy  in  a   world  where  people  are  very  distrustful   of  global  governments.  I  think  that's  a   real  idea  that  has  sticking  power.  I   think  of  course  that  this  uh  whole  AI   agentic  transaction  layer  that's  an  idea   that  has  sticking  power  and  I  think  that   when  you  kind  of  tunnel  through  those   ideas  you  get  some  really  interesting   outputs.  We'll  be  talking  about  the   narratives  that  make  sense  today  after   all  the  bloodshed  and  all  of  the   insanity  of  course  and  DeFi  continue  to   make  ultimate  sense  in  cryptoland.  And   then  you  start  to  see  that,  oh,  there's   actually  these  connections  to  the  world   that  we  had  imagined,  but  it's  just   slightly  different  than  what  we  thought   it  would  have  been  in  2021.   But  I  we  we'll  do  that  on  a  different   episode.  But  I  think  it's  really   important  in  these  times  that  you  remove   the  speculation  and  just  say,  okay,  what   would  people  or  would  people  use  this   technology  for  if  there  wasn't  a   speculative  element?  and  privacy  for   sure,  entertainment  for  sure,  agentic   commerce  for  sure,  um  some  kind  of  way   to  scale  the  bottlenecks  and  to  assist   with  AI  bottlenecks.  I  think  that  makes   sense  for  sure.  So  those  are  the  things   that  I  think  are  very  productive  to   think  about  in  times  like  this.   And  if  you're  not  following  uh  the  AI   drama,  this  is  an  amazing  video.  This   guy  said,  \"I'm  the  bottleneck  now.\"  He   essentially  went  to  go  check  a  bug   report  in  a  software  he  was  building  in   Slack.  He  dropped  the  bug  report  into   OpenAI's  codeex.  He  got  the  code  that   Codex  produced  and  then  he  approved  it   to  be  merged  in  and  to  be  for  the  bug  to   be  fixed.  But  really,  the  truth  is  he   didn't  need  to  be  there.  And  he  realized   that  during  this  and  that's  why  he  said,   \"I'm  the  bottleneck  now.\"  Because  it   went  from  this  stuff  doesn't  really  work   unless  you're  very  good  with  it  to  oh   no,  it  actually  works  better  without  me   there.  If  I  had  just  given  it  the   authority  to  fix  stuff,  it  would  have   fixed  it.  It  would  have  taken  the  Jira   ticket  and  it  would  have  or  the  Slack   notification  and  it  would  have  just   fixed  the  thing  on  its  own.  And  that's   where  I  think  we're  getting  to  the  point   where  people  who  use  chat  GPT  in  2022   and  2023,  they  don't  understand  what's   happening  right  now.  They  don't   understand  the  pace  and  the  velocity  of   increase  that's  happening  in  AI.  But  if   you  are  touching  these  tools,  it  is  in  a   the  only  way  you  can  describe  it  is  it's   kind  of  like  magic.  And  that's  when  I   feel  like  we'll  look  back.  I  had  a   thought  this  week  that  we'll  look  back   at  this  moment  as  kind  of  the  moment   that  we've  started  to  see  real   intelligence  being  created.  So  whatever   you  want  to  call  it,  AGI  art,  like  I   don't  care  what  the  terminology  is.  I'm   sure  someone  can  prove  or  disprove  that.   But  this  is  a  moment  we're  we're  living   through  a  major  inflection  point  in   history.  And  to  that  point,  apparently   um  the  Pentagon  wanted  to  embed  Claude   into  mil  military  systems  via  Palunteer.   Uh  Claude  used  in  the  Maduro  extraction,   people  got  smoked.  Anthropic  exe  calls   Palanteer  and  says,  \"Hey,  did  our  AI   help  kill  people?\"  And  um  effectively   the  AI  or  effectively  Claude  CEO  says  he   doesn't  want  that  to  happen.  He  doesn't   believe  that  that's  right  and  so  he   doesn't  want  Claude  being  used  um  in  the   military  and  the  Pentagon  says  we're   going  to  use  it  for  all  lawful  purposes   or  nothing.  Uh  and  this  is  where  you're   getting  actually  a  beef  between  the   Pentagon  and  Claude  and  Claude.  So   you're  seeing  right  now  this  is  kind  of   an  interesting  topic,  right?  because   we're  starting  to  get  to  the  morality   aspect  of  AI  of  questioning  what  can  it   be  used  for,  what  should  it  be  used  for,   and  what's  going  to  happen  over  the  next   few  years  is  going  to  shape  the  next  few   decades  of  our  lifetimes,  uh  potentially   the  the  future.  So,  this  is  a  debate   where  if  you  want  to  have  it  or  not,   it's  not  really  up  to  you.  This  is   happening  and  I  encourage  you  not  to  be   stressed  because  in  the  end,  you  or  I   can't  really  change  what's  happening   here.  But,  it's  interesting.  I  it's  so   interesting  to  see  the  way  the  world's   changing  and  it's  very  interesting  if   you're  paying  attention  very  obvious  to   see  that  the  next  maybe  20  or  30  years   will  be  some  of  the  most  opportunistic   for  wealth  creation  specifically  the   next  few  years  here  are  going  to  be   absolutely  insane  because  most  of  the   world  sees  AI  as  a  marginally  useful   tool  they  don't  see  it  as  completely   disruptive  and  they  certainly  haven't   priced  in  the  value  of  embodied  AI  and   robots  so  I  think  we  have  just  this   moment  here  uh  where  all  assets  are   trending  down  there's  this  calm  and   really  it's  a  mad  dash  in  my  opinion  to   get  to  the  means  of  production  of   tomorrow  and  I  think it's  a  it's  a   phenomenal  time  to  be  an  investor  uh   where  even  if  you  don't  believe  in  you   know  anthropic  it's  very  obvious  that   the  the  needs  of  energy  will  increase   and  even  if  you  don't  believe  in  AI  too   much  um  I  think  that  there's  just  ways   that  you  can  logic  around  understanding   why  these  things  will  be  important  so   this  is  where  I'm  at  with  it  I  think   that  if  you're  not  paying  attention  to   AI  you're  You  know,  I  feel  bad.  I  do   feel  bad  for  you  because  so  much  has   changed.  So  much  has  changed.  Um,  let's   see.  I'm  going  to  get  to  Q&A  in  a  second   here.  Yeah,  I'm  Let's  get  to  the  Q&A   now.   Okay.  So   all right.  Well,  if  you  guys  have  any   questions.  Yeah.  Bit  tensor  trending   number  one.  Is  it  now?  Is  it  now?   Have  a  nice  day.   All  right.  Got  Bit  Tensor  up  here  at   number  three  on  the  top  100  gains.  I   mean,  this  isn't  much.  A  bare  market   rally  should  be  a  ripper,  especially   after  like  the  N  minus  90%  that  we've   seen  on  most  coins.  This  isn't  to  me   isn't  crazy.  It's  not  crazy  enough.   Like,  you've  had  a  couple  of  coins   double,  but  that's  not  this  isn't  insane   mode  that  you  would  expect  out  of  a   proper  bare  market  rally  if  I'm  going  to   be  completely  honest.  So,  I'm  looking   for  a  little  bit  more  here  uh  before  I   really  start  to  say,  \"Okay,  there's  some   animal  spirits  here.   Supernova  is  live.  It's  beautiful.  I  uh   I  think  so.  I  mean,  if  I  could  summarize   and  actually  explain  to  you  how  hard  the   team  works,  it's  pretty  unbelievable.  I   feel  very  very  blessed  just  to  be   included  in  their  project.  That's  how  I   feel.  um  obviously  can't  control  the   market  conditions  on  Avalanche,  but   if  the  project  is  able  to  get  the  same   foot  foothold  on  Ethereum  and  have  a   consistent  fee  layer,  a  significant   amount  of  TVL,  that  team  will  continue   to  add  very  interesting  features  and   expand  horizontally  into  very   interesting  areas  and  the  product  can   become  something  totally  unique.  Um,  no   guarantees,  no  promises.  The  market  is   brutal  and  um  certainly  don't  want   people  speculating,  but  I  am  just  very   very  excited  about  what  the  team  is  has   built.  They  work  six  days  a  week  almost   all  day,  more  than  12  hours  days.  Not   because  I  tell  them  to.  I'm  not  burning   their  feet  or  anything.  It's  just  that's   how  they  are.  They  are  built  different.   And  um  you  know,  they're  just  very   talented.  So,  uh  the  market  doesn't   justify  or  doesn't  give  out  cookies  for   hard  work.  It  doesn't  give  out  cookies   for  uh  doing  the  right  thing  or  working   on  the  right  stuff.  It  it  gives  out   cookies  for  winners  and  winners  only.   And  so  that's  the  goal  is  to  win.  Um,   and  most  of  the  participants  actually  on   Black  Hole  are  institutional  capital.  So   it's  not  even  a  game  of  like  retail   audience  like  uh  this  audience  here.   Love  this  audience.  But  that's  not  what   actually  drives  Black  Hole  to  be  so   successful.  It's  an  institutional   capital  uh  engine.  And  so  uh  we're   hoping  to  play  a  role  in  that  ecosystem   on  ETH.  We're  hoping  that  the  product   Supernova  does.  And  there's  a  lot  of   ideas  that  the  team  has  for  how  to   expand  it.   We're  not  bailing  on  Avalanche.  Uh,   Black  Hole  will  continue  to  live   natively  on  Avalanche  for  forever,   right?  As  long  as  there  are  fees  to  be   uh,  traded  and  transaction  volume.   Which  AI  stock  do  I  like  the  most?  I'm   actually  focused  more  on  robotics.  I'm   going  to  be  doing  some  like  documentary   style  deep  journalism  on  the  robotics   scene  here  on  the  channel  because  it  is   very  fascinating  and  I  believe  that   there  are  going  to  be  opportunities  for   investments  in  different  uh  companies   that  are  not  going  to  be  like  altcoins   where  there's  a  new  one  that  can  do  the   next  the  same  thing  the  next  day.  This   is  going  to  be  the  type  of  protectable   moat  where  very  few  companies  will   actually  be  able  to  scale  production  of   the  type  of  robotics  that  are  going  to   do  massive  uh  literal  economic  output.   And  so  the  investments  in  this  while   there  might  be  a  few  dozen  companies   with  maybe  three  or  four  or  five  mega   leaders,  it's  not  going  to  be  like   crypto  where  there's  millions  of  coins   and  you  know  all  of  them  are  you  know   extremely  competitive  with  each  other   and  only  a  few  have  really  emote.  I   think  it'll  be  something  where  it's   pretty  easy  to  ride  the  trend.  And  I   think  for  especially  for  retailers,   especially  for  the  little  guys,  figuring   out  how  to  get  access  into  robotics   equity  feels  like  the  endgame  for  the   next  5  to  10  years.  Because  at  the   margins  at  at  on  the  tail  risk  that   robotics  is  as  successful  as  we  think  it   would  be,  there's  a  lot  of  reshaping  of   society  that  would  happen  in  that   physical  laborers  not  as  needed.  uh  the   cost  of  food  production,  the  value  of   even  land  because  you  can  have,  you   know,  different  uh  robots  sort  of  you   don't  need  to  be  around  humans  to  have   labor  being  done.  There's  a  lot  of  lot   of  things  that  might  change.  So,  it's   worth  thinking  about  just  from  a   philosophical  lens.  And  I  think  that   right  now  the  world  is  just  really  not   priced  any  of  this  in  and  there's  not   that  many  players  and  I  think  it's  very   interesting  content.  So,  I  hope  you  guys   enjoy  it.  I'm  gonna  be  making  uh  videos   on  that  myself.  And  I  do  I  have   allocated  significant  chunk  of  my  free   cash,  my  my  non-invested  position  into   robotics  deals  because  I'm  I'm  just  just   fascinated.  I'd  also  like  to  figure  out   ways  to  have  those  worlds  interact  with   crypto.  Again,  that's  something  we're   talking  about.  It's  it's  definitely  too   early  to  discuss  on  on  stream.   I'm  going  to  do  a  robotics  specific   content.  This  that's  not  today,  but   that's  just  where  my  interests  are  right   now.  I  think  right  now  is  a  a  point  in   time  where  you  should  be  following  your   interest,  following  your  nose.  There's   so  much  happening  in  the  world.  You   don't  have  to  do  one  thing  or  the  other.   I  think  we  should  all  be  paying   attention  to  crypto  because  this  is  the   the  financial  extension  of  the  internet   and  it  will  be  where  I  think  the  vast   majority  of  wealth  is  created.  But  as   crypto  touches  other  industries,  it's   very  obvious  AI,  it's  very  obvious   robotics,  uh  it's  very  obvious  sort  of   physical  resources  required  for  those   things  to  work.  Um,  and  right  now  I   think  we  just  need  to  kind  of  embrace   the  kind  of  boringness  that's  happening   before  we  get  the  new  Fed  chair.  And  I   think  that's  going  to  create  a  regime   shift.  So  the  next  few  months  might  be  a   little  boring,  but  it's  also  a  chance  to   plan  to  underwrite  what  you  think  is   super  important  going  forward  without   the  speculative  frenzy  around  it.  And  we   can  figure  out  where  the  value  is   together.  But  I'm  really  passionate  and   very  very  convinced  that  this  will   probably  be  the  next  two  years.  I  think   I'm  going  to  make  the  most  impact  for   the  rest  of  my  life  since  finding  crypto   in  2017.  That  moment  where  I  found   crypto  and  I  started  this  YouTube   channel  and  I  started  working  in  this   industry  catalyzed  my  career  in  a  whole   new  direction  as  well  as  my  ability  to   create  wealth.  And  I  believe  that  the   curiosity  and  the  excitement  I  feel   towards  these  new  fields  and  towards   what's  happening  in  the  world,  I  can   feel  it  happening  again  where  the  next   era  is  going  to  be  another  step  change   and  another  exponential  growth  pattern.   So,  that's  what  I'm  looking  to  create   and  I  want  to  bring  you  guys  along  with   me.  Hopefully,  I  can  create  a  tremendous   amount  of  wealth  in  this  audience.  Um,   but  at  the  very  least,  I  want  to   document  my  journey  so  that  you  guys  see   exactly  what  I'm  doing  to  make  money  on   a  short-term  basis,  how  I  funnel  those   gains  into  long-term  positions  to   compound  the  wealth.  Um,  that's  the   goal.   >> All  right.  Well,  I  think  we've  had  a   good  uh  a  good  little  run  here.  Um  if   you  guys  want  me  to  talk  about  any   specific  topics,  let  me  know  in  the   comments  section  below  and  we  will  cover   on  the  next  live  stream.  Just  to  recap,   I  think  that  we  might  be  looking  at  a   bottom  sometime  in  June  if  the  change  to   the  federal  balance  sheet  is  the  same   and  has  the  same  lag  as  uh  we  saw  last   time.  We  saw  a  26-  week  lag  between  the   increase  of  the  balance  sheet  and  the   actual  increase  in  Bitcoin.  Actually,   somehow  it  doesn't  have  it  on  this  chart   anymore.  Um,  but  that  is  the  same  lag   that  would  put  us  at  the  beginning  of   June.  And  that  cor  that  correlates  uh  or   corresponds  really  with  the  beginning  of   Kevin  Walsh  stepping  into  the  big  shoes   of  Jerome  Powell.  Again,  when  things   line  up  like  that,  it's  interesting   interesting  data.  I  wouldn't  be   surprised  to  see  the  bottom  sometime   around  midyear  2026.  And  with  that  said,   I  look  forward  to  buying  it  with  all  of   you.  Again,  make  sure  to  check  out   Supernova.  There  is  a  giveaway.  Five   people,  5,000  bucks  each.  Hopefully,  it   helps  make  your  day  a  little  better.  I   hope  each  and  every  one  of  you  win.  I   wish  all  of  you  could  win,  but  make  sure   to  go  to  Supernova  uh  the  Twitter   x.com/supnovadex   and",
