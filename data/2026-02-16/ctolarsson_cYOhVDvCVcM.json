    "transcript": "Bitcoin  has  had  a  good  bounce.  There   could  even  be  an  Adam  and  Eve  or  an   inverse  head  and  shoulders  building,  but   the  trend  is  still  down.  So,  do  I  think   the  bottom  is  in?  I'll  come  back  to  this   chart  in  a  few  minutes  because  I  need  to   explain  something  important  to  you   first.  Many  of  you  have  felt  that  this   is  some  kind  of  magic.  How  did  the  Lion   line  know  that  this  would  go  down   already  here  in  October  when  almost   everyone  else  was  still  ultra  bullish?   How?  I'll  tell  you  interest  in  loan  line   always  increases  when  it  gets  difficult.   Making  money  in  the  markets  is  easy.   Keeping  it  is  hard.  When  everything  goes   up,  everyone's  a  genius.  The  loudest   influencers  with  the  highest  predictions   gets  all  the  attention.  It  seems  you   actually  have  to  go  through  one  cycle  of   massive  damage  to  your  portfolio   yourself  and  feel  the  pain  before  you're   even  receptive  to  something  which  needs   actual  knowledge  and  work  and  the   process  and  capital  preservation   stop-loss  and  all  those  boring  things.   It's  a  much  nicer  idea  to  just  do  what   Murad  or  Plan  B  tells  you  to  do,  to  buy   conviction  meme  coins  or  predict  the   prices  and  then  you  get  rich.  So  easy.   The  only  problem  with  it  is  that  it   doesn't  work.  This  stretch,  everyone   loves  me.  In  fact,  interest  in  lotion   line  is  at  all-time  high  right  now.  Even   though  I've  been  here  with  this  for  8   years  now.  Oh,  Lion,  so  amazing.  How  did   you  know  that  it  would  go  down?  I   didn't.  I  didn't  know  anything  more  than   you  did  about  what  the  market  was  going   to  do.  I  just  know  that  trends  often   stick.  The  tech  company  that  was  winning   yesterday  is  usually  the  tech  company   that's  winning  tomorrow.  The  company   that  has  done  badly  so  far  is  more   likely  to  do  badly  tomorrow  as  well.   There  is  no  fairness  like  the  company   that  was  doing  badly  last  week  deserves   to  make  profit  this  week.  That's  not  how   it  works.  Same  with  price  trends  which   comes  from  sentiments.  They  also  often   latch  on  and  stick.  You  can  observe   trends  everywhere  around  you.  Like  in   Sweden  where  I  grew  up,  if  you  predict   that  the  weather  tomorrow  will  be   roughly  the  same  as  it  is  today,  you  get   it  70%  right.  All  the  satellites  and   supercomputers  just  add  a  little  bit  on   top  of  that.  But  let  me  explain  trends   once  and  for  all  so  that  everyone  will   remember  it  for  life  after  this  video.   Chance  of  getting  laid.  Imagine  two   friends  at  the  bar.  On  one  bar  stool,  we   have  Brad.  He's  a  quarterback.  He's   confident.  He's  got  the  hair,  the   jawline.  The  ladies  love  Brad.  Oh,  he's   so  cute.  The  second  guy   is  a  crypto  trader.  Vitalik's  less   successful  cousin,  Vincent.  From  a   fundamental  analysis  perspective,  who  is   more  likely  to  get  it  tonight?  Brad,   right?  Solid  FA.  And  each  day,  Brad  gets   more  and  more  confident.  The  ladies  feel   it.  His  chances  of  getting  lucky  moons   like  there  is  no  tomorrow.  Vincent,  not   so  much.  The  constant  rejections  each   night  the  two  guys  go  out  makes  him  even   less  confident.  Eventually,  he  stops   even  trying.  His  chances  drop  near  zero.   Mega  wrecked.  Until  one  day,  Vincent   wakes  up  and  he  has  had  enough.  The  year   of  the  fire  is  starting.  Vincent  gets  a   haircut,  buys  a  shirt,  cleans  himself   up,  goes  to  the  gym,  buys  CTO  Lson's   course,  and  realizes  what  he  did  wrong   in  the  markets.  This  whole  time  he  buys   a  pool  villa  in  a  pizza.  Models  are  soon   feeding  him  margaritas  and  olives  on   toothpicks.  Models  and  villas  in  a  pizza   are  not  guaranteed  results.  Meanwhile,   Brad  starts  getting  arrogant,  lazy,  and   slowly  turns  into  an  which   makes  him  far  less  likely  to  get  lucky.   He  gets  bitter,  even  less  likely.  He   stops  taking  care  of  himself  and  he's   out.  So,  even  deeply  entrenched  trends   can  change  like  this,  but  it  usually   takes  time.  Lan  line  would  do  an   excellent  job  at  predicting  which  of   these  two  guys  would  get  laid  tomorrow   based  on  their  history  of  getting  laid   both  during  the  first  phase  for  both   guys  and  during  the  second  phase  and  it   would  correctly  show  uncertainty  during   the  periods  of  change.  Is  that  because   Lorshal  line  has  some  profound  insights   into  the  mating  preference  of  women?  No,   it's  because  trends  stick.  And  as  you   guessed,  this  was  not  actually  Vincent   and  Brad's  hookup  statistics.  This  was   PayPal  stock.  This  was  Salana.  And  the   mega  that  was  down  99%  was  Zeus.  So  with   Bitcoin,  I  didn't  have  some  magic   knowledge.  I  just  know  that  trends  often   stick.  Do  you  think  trends  will  go  away   because  of  AI?  I  don't  think  so.  I  think   they  will  get  more  powerful  and  there   will  be  more  cases  where  the  luck  turns   like  it  did  for  our  friends  Brad  and   Vincent.  And  if  your  strategy  is  to   hodle  Brad  stocks,  you  might  be  in  for  a   surprise  because  Vincent  is  coming.  If   you  are  Brad,  you're  doing  great  in  the   current  environment.  Don't  get  lazy.   continuous  improvement.  Keep  learning   and  get  even  better.  Associate  with   people  better  than  you.  If  you  are  a   Vincent,  you  know  what  to  do.  If  you're   one  of  the  ladies  at  that  bar,  forget   about  those  guys  and  get  your  own  pool   villa.  You  can  do  better  than  that.  So,   back  to  Bitcoin.  It's  so  simple.  And  I   can't  believe  I'm  sitting  here  8  years   in  and  there's  still  all  those  guys  with   a  macro  M2  ISM  predictions  and   everything.  And  I'm  sitting  here,  dude,   it's  trending  down.  Of  course,  there's   more  to  it  for  this  basic  insight  to  be   useful  in  practice.  That's  why  I  have   this  annoying  course  and  process  and   report  and  tools  and  community  and  all   that.  For  example,  risk  management  to   make  sure  that  one  nasty  surprise   doesn't  turn  into  a  personal  disaster.   If  you  take  all  your  money  and  leverage   long  Vincent's  odds  in  a  pizza  with  the   models,  you  can  be  sure  that  he  will   wake  up  tomorrow  and  decide  to  become  a   monk.  You  can  translate  that  risk   management  into  exchange  bankruptcies,   the  10th  of  October  liquidation,  the   Luna  disaster,  or  just  hodel  strategy   when  it  turns  out  that  quality  projects   can  actually  dump  90  to  99%.  Remember   Solana  dropped  97%  in  the  previous   cycle.  So  there  is  more  to  it  but  it  all   builds  on  this  very  simple  insights  of   trends  in  technology  assets  which  I   don't  think  is  going  away.  Today  is  the   last  day  in  year  of  the  snake.  I've  read   up  on  it  and  the  snake  year  is  supposed   to  be  bad  and  if  the  numbers  add  up  how   much  is  it  quickly  quickly  nine.  It   signals  ending  very  bad  and  2025  was  a   very  bad  year  for  many  in  Bitcoin  and   crypto.  But  for  me  overall  2025  was   amazing.  So  if  that  was  a  bad  year,  I   can't  wait  for  the  good  one.  Tomorrow  is   the  first  day  in  the  year  of  the   firehorse.  And  I  invite  you  to  start  the   new  year  by  investing  in  yourself.

And  if  you're  an  old  OG  member  from   years  back,  but  you're  not  on  Line  Pro   yet  for  some  reason,  there's  a  lucky   envelope  for  you  to  just  send  me  an   email.  Everyone  taken  care  of.  My  horse   is  waiting.  Ah,  the  Bitcoin  chart.  You   have  to  be  able  to  keep  multiple  time   frames  in  your  head  at  the  same  time.   Strategically,  long-term,  I'm  mega   bullish  on  Bitcoin.  I  covered  why  in  the   previous  video,  so  I  won't  repeat  it.   Tactically  mediumterm  the  trend  is  still   down.  There's  no  confirmed  bottom   pattern  yet.  And  in  previous  cycles  the   downtrends  have  lasted  longer  for  about   a  year  and  have  gone  deeper  than  we  have   now.  And  I  hope  that  repeats  very  short   term.  There  is  some  strength  definitely.   I  even  bought  some  here.  Price  was   62,776   when  I  posted  it.  And  if  Bitcoin  can   break  up  above  this  short-term   resistance,  there  are  good  chances  that   price  at  the  very  least  runs  up  and   seriously  challenges  the  next  major   resistance  at  74K.  And  if  that  breaks  up   too,  the  short  to  medium-term  situation   definitely  changes  more  favorably.  If  it   breaks  down  instead,  I  set  my  sights  on   40  to  44K  based  on  this  volume  profile.   we  can  get  some  wild  chops  the  next   quarters.  If  we  break  above  this,  it's   absolutely  possible  that  we  run  up  into   the  next  meat  of  the  volume  here  at  80k   plus  and  then  still  hit  this  circle  in   October.  The  good  news  is  that  execution   wise,  I  don't  need  to  predict  how  this   goes.  I  will  simply  react  to  what   actually  happens.  Bitcoin  cannot  go  to   $250,000500,0001   $1  million  with  the  trend  down.  Can't   happen  mathematically.  City  of.com  hours   left  on  the  discount.  Press  the  button.   Welcome  on  board.  Thank  you,  Tuck.  Now   my  horse  is  waiting.  CTO  Lson  out.",

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin piacán jelenleg csökkenő tendencia figyelhető meg, bár lehet, hogy az árak rövid távon fellendülnek. A videó szerzője hangsúlyozza, hogy a piac előrejelzése nem varázslat, hanem a trendek megfigyelésén alapul. Az emberek hajlamosak elfeledni, hogy a megőrzés nehézségekkel jár, és könnyen elmerülnek a spekulatív vásárlásokban. A magabiztos, sikertelen kereskedők, mint például Vincent, képesek lehetnek változtatni, ha megszabadulnak eddigi hibáiktól. A Bitcoin jövője a trendek és a technológiai eszközök stabilitásán múlik, de a szerző szerint az erősebb verseny és a folyamatos tanulás kulcsfontosságú a sikerhez. Az elemzés végén úgy vélik, hogy a Bitcoin piaca 2025-ben társulhat komoly kihívásokkal, de a fordulatok is valószínűek.",
    "summary_en": "Currently, a downtrend is observable in the Bitcoin market, although there could be a short-term bounce in prices. The presenter emphasizes that market predictions aren't magic but are based on observing trends. People tend to forget that preservation in trading involves difficulties and easily get lost in speculative purchases. Confident yet unsuccessful traders, like Vincent, can make changes if they learn from past mistakes. The future of Bitcoin depends on the stability of trends and technological assets, with the presenter highlighting that continuous improvement and learning are essential for success. Toward the end of the analysis, it is suggested that the Bitcoin market may face significant challenges in 2025 but that reversals are also likely.",
