    "transcript": "running  scared.  Bitcoin  clinging  on  as   tech  stocks  also  struggle.  The  chances   of  another  rate  cut  recede  and  crypto's   fear  and  greed  index  falls  to  its  lowest   level  ever.  Idiocracy.  As  a  South  Korean   exchange  accidentally  sends  out  billions   of  dollars  worth  of  BTC,  is  it  any   wonder  people  don't  take  crypto   seriously?  Counterfactual.  As  it  becomes   clear  that  the  only  people  to  have  made   money  this  cycle  are  the  Trump  family,   we  have  to  ask,  would  crypto  have  been   better  under  Kamala?  And  we'll  have  the   tweets  of  the  week,  dates  for  your   diary,  and  some  top  quality  TAs   sprinkled  on  top.  This  is  the  Coin   Bureau  News  Live.   Hello  friends.  This  is  the  Coin  Bureau   News  Live.  Welcome  everyone.  It  is  great   to  see  you  again.  Uh  it  is  great  to  be   back.  Nick,  hello.  Hello.   >> Great  to  be  back.  How's  it  going  guy?   >> Yeah,  I'm  good.  I'm  all  right.  I'm  all   right.  I  mean,  I'm  just,  you  know,  I'm   just  bearing  up.   >> Yeah.  Congratulations  to  all  the   Americans  out  there.  I  know  it's   President's  Day  and  if  you're  tuning  in   for  President's  Day,  you  know,  I  know   you've  got  other  more  important  things   to  watch  like  Trump's  speech   >> about  why  he's  the  best  president  in  the   world,  but  now  you're  here  with  us.   >> A  very  happy  President's  Day  to  all  who   celebrate.  Um,  yes.  So,  that  means  uh  US   markets  are  closed  today,  right?   >> Yeah,  exactly.   >> Okay.  Well,  I  mean,  given  what's  been   going  on  recently,  that's  probably  a   good  thing  at  all.  Maybe  they  could  just   remain  closed  for  the  rest  of  the  week   and  give  us  all  a  break.   >> Um  Oh,  yes.  So,  smash  the  like  button,   everyone.  Um,  if  the  uh  if  the  counter   get  down  below  Nick  gets  to  100%  we'll   we'll  I  don't  know  we'll  do  something   outrageous.  Shall  we?   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  They  can  they  can  tell  us   what  to  do  in  the  comments.  Tell  us  what   you  guys  want  us  to  do  if  we  reach  100   100%  likes.   >> Yes.   >> 1,000  likes.  There  we  go.   >> Absolutely.  Yes.  Uh  and  a  very  good   morning  or  good  afternoon  or  indeed  good   evening  to  everyone  watching.  Um  and   just  to  remind  you  folks,  it  is  not  my   birthday  today.  So  don't  don't  let's   start  that  again.  Today  we  are  going  to   uh  we're  going  to  look  back  on  a  week   where  as  we  said  in  the  in  the  headlines   there  the  fear  and  greed  crypto's  fear   and  greed  plunged  to  its  lowest  level   ever.  Um  and  it's  still  not  it's  still   not  quite  at  zero.  Maybe  maybe  we  could   get  it  there  today.  Maybe  this  will  be   what  finally  tips  it  to  zero.  So  we're   going  to  talk  about  that.  And  uh  yes,   we're  going  to  have  a  uh  a  light-hearted   look  at  some  stupidity  uh  in  the  crypto   space  that  was  uh  making  headlines  last   week.  And  uh  and  then  look,  you  know,  we   have  to  ask,  as  I  said,  we  have  to  ask,   would  it  have  been  better  under  Kamala   because  it  ain't  been  great  under  Donald   >> on  this  President's  Day  guy?  We  get   sacriiggious.   >> It  seems  appropriate.  It  seems   appropriate  to  be  uh  to  be  discussing   presidential  matters.  Um  okay,  Nick's   gym  routine.  Yeah,  that'  probably  be   good.  And  a  tea  recipe  from  Guy.   >> Look,  you  can  have  the  tea  recipe  for   free.  You  get  a  tea  bag,  plop  it  in  some   hot  water,  bit  of  milk.  Bosch.   >> You're  not  a  big  tea  drink  tea  drinker,   but  you  do  have  a  good  coffee  recipe.   >> Yes.  It's  it  involves  a  very  very   involved  process  of  bean  selection,   grinding  and  all  that.  So   >> yeah,  we  had  some  Ethiopian  beans  in  the   office  today.  It  was  lovely.  Um  and  what   they  wanted  a  500k  BTC  as  well.   >> Oh,  we  can  get  that  for  them  for  1,000   likes.  We'll  try  our  best,  guys.  You   know,   >> we'll  uh  we'll  at  this  stage  it's  more   chance  of  a  500k  BTC  than  you  guys   getting  a,000  likes.   >> That's  where  we  are,  folks.  That's  where   we  are.  Okay,  Nick.  Um  let's  uh  that's   the  housekeeping  done.  Let's  kick  off   and  uh  and  talk  about  last  week  in   Bitcoin  cuz  it  was  eventful,  wasn't  it?   >> It  was  inventful  indeed.  So  uh  as  per   usual,  Monday  started  off  with  Sailor   hitting  the  buy  button  or  he  obviously   disclosed  the  purchases  he  made  the  week   prior.  $90  million.  It's  okay.  It's   doing  well,  still  managing.   >> And  he  also  says  he  will  buy  forever.   >> Okay.  Yeah.   >> He'll  just  he'll  just  keep  buying  uh   until  he's  dead.   >> Indeed.  Yeah.  We're  going  to  be  we  we're   not  going  to  be  selling.  are  going  to  be   buying  Bitcoin.  Um,  but  unfortunately   for  him,  Strategy  is  still  underwater  by   as  much  as  $5  billion.  The  average   purchase  price  of  uh  the  Bitcoin  on   Strategy's  balance  sheet  is  $78,815.   >> Okay.  Yeah.   >> Okay.  All  fine  then.  Um,  okay.  Uh  then   Tuesday  uh  the  white  house  hosted  a   meeting  around  uh  with  so  this  was  um   crypto  companies  and  crypto  exchanges   and  banks  about  the  clarity  act.   >> Ah  yes  but  the  banks  weren't  having  it.   Uh  there  was  little  progress  made.  We   did  a  video  on  this  last  week  as  well,   but  the  banks  are  adamant  that  they   don't  want  any  sort  of  yield  paid  on   stable  coins.   >> Yeah,  this  is  this  is  starting  to  look   like  a  bit  of  an  impass,  isn't  it?  I  I   must  say,  I  don't  know  about  you,  I'm   not  all  that  hopeful  this  Clarity  Act  is   going  to  get  passed.  And  actually,  in   its  current  form  with  banning  stable   coin  yield,  I  don't  think  we  want  it   passed,  but  uh  it  doesn't  look  like  it's   going to  pass.   >> Doesn't  look  good,  Brav.   >> Yeah.  Um  meanwhile,  um  but  h  you  know,   it's  this  odd  relationship  between  banks   and  crypto  because  on  the  one  hand,   you've  got  banks  uh  you  know,  they  hate   it.  Uh  on  the  other  hand,  you've  got  the   likes  of  Goldman  Sachs  um  actually   upping  their  crypto  exposure.   >> Yeah.  up  to  $1.1  billion  in  Bitcoin,   ETH,  um,  and  XRP.  It's  just  0.33   percentage  of  their  total  assets,  but   it's  something.  It's  It's  something.   >> It's  not  much,  but  it's  honest.   >> Here  we  go.   >> Um,  that  takes  us  to  Wednesday.  Then,   uh,  Bitcoin  uh,  went  below  68K  and  then   67K  as  well.  More  of  the  red  candles   that  we've  come  to  know  and  love.  So,   well,   >> indeed.  Um,  NFP  numbers  came  out  and   they  were  actually  pretty  good  on  the   surface.   above  expectations  130k  versus  forecast   of  66k.  However,  all  that  glitters  isn't   gold  and  that  shows  you  where  the  uh   jobs  were  coming  from  and  spoiler  alert,   most  of  the  jobs  were  coming  from  the   health  care  sector.   >> Okay,  this  is  pretty  crazy.   >> This  is  presumably  all  the  people  who've   been  recruited  as  psychiatric   professionals  to  deal  with  all  the   crypto  bros   >> with  all  the  crypto  bros  and  all  the   people  who've  lost  their  jobs  because   there's  not  been  any  job  creation  in  any   other  sector.  So  you're  either  in  the   psychiatric  ward  because  you  were  a   crypto  bro  or  because  you  are  losing   your  job  because  there's  no  jobs  being   created  in  anything  else  other  than   healthcare  in  the  US.  So   >> great  for  mental  health.   >> Okay.  Wonderful.  This  meant  uh  of  course   that  the  chances  of  another  rate  cut  at   the  next  FOMC  meeting  took  a  tumble  um   which  duly  punted  Bitcoin  uh  below  66K.   >> Yep,  there  we  go.  Below  66K.  And  get   this  guys,  the  fear  and  greed  fell  to   its  lowest  level  ever.  Five.  Crazy   stuff.   >> Where  were  you  when  the  Daddy,  where   were  you  when  the  fear  and  greed  index   hit  five?   >> I  know  it's  mental.  Although,  to  be   honest,  it  is  possible  that  it  could   actually  go  to  a  zero.   Tired  of  winning,  man.   >> Oh,  wonderful.  I  I  did  like  the  cartoon   as  well  where  they  were  just  uh  someone   had  just  painted  on  an  extra  bit  below   zero.  So  we  could  go  negative  perhaps.   >> Okay.  Um  so  all  that  takes  us  to   Thursday.  Tech  stocks  are  also  selling   off.  We're  not  alone  folks.  It's  not   just  crypto.  Tech  stocks  are  having  a   bit  of a  nightmare  as  well.   >> AI  fears.  There  was  a  lot  of  AI  moves   last  week  in  terms  of  new  models  being   released  and  a  lot  of  fear  around  what   these  could  be  doing  to  companies  and   jobs  and  everything.  So  that  caused  the   tech  sector  to  sell  off  particularly  in   the  software  sector.  Y   >> um  but  then  remember  guy  our  favorite   institutional  price  predictor  the  one  on   the  in  the  one  standard  charted  Mr.   to  Standard  Chartered.  Presumably,  these   guys  are  ultra  bullish  and  they  say   we're  going  to  the  moon  within  the  next   couple  of  weeks,  right?   >> For  context,  guys,  you  got  to  know   Standard  Charters.  They  probably  make   better,  they  probably  make  more   parabolic  Bitcoin  price  predictions  than   Tom  Lee  or  your  average  crypto  YouTuber.   And  they  had  a  price  prediction  out  at   as  late  as  July  last  year  that  Bitcoin   would  hit  $200,000  by  the  end  of  the   year.   >> And  now  they've  come  out,  they've  said,   \"Well,  it's  still  going  to  hit  $100,000   this  year,  end  of  this  year,  but  we  go   into  $50,000.\"  which  presumably  given   their  track  record  means  we're  probably   going  down  to  $10  before  it  shoots  up  to   1  million.   >> Just  capture  that  spread  and  you'll  be   absolutely  fine.  Um,  yes.  So,  uh,  so   that  standard  chart  is  it's  I  find  it   quite  reassuring  that  basically  everyone   is  getting  this  wrong  like  that,  you   know,  it  it  just  it  just  proves  no  one   knows  anything,  doesn't  it?  Which  and   there's  there's  some  comfort  to  be  taken   from  that.  Um,  this  takes  us  to  Friday.   Uh,  CPI  numbers  um,  they  were  pretty   much  in  line  with  expectations,  weren't   they?  Yeah,  indeed.  Uh  and  um  then  that   basically  kept  took  us  to  the  weekend.   Bitcoin  managed  to  reclaim  70k.  Um  and   then  Sailor  also  release  released  a  plan   to  deal  with  the  debt.  And  that's   basically  to  equitize  it  essentially   slowly  convert  the  debt  over  the  next  3   to  six  years  to  equity.   >> Okay.   >> And  we'll  get  to  why  that's  important  a   bit  later  on  tweets  of  the  week.   >> Mhm.  Um  now,  uh  we  we  talked  about  uh   employment  numbers.  Um  this  is  this  is  a   bit  more  recent.  Uh  yeah,  here  we  are.   US  unemployment  figures,  a  massive  1   million  downward  correction.   >> Yeah,  indeed.  So  basically  all  those  job   that  all  that  job  growth  we  we  we   thought  we  saw  last  year   >> almost  evaporate  like  only  only  100,000   jobs  then.  Okay.  Over  the  whole  year.   >> So  all  those  mental  health  professionals   were  recruited  realized  that  they  had  to   spend  most  of  their  time  speaking  to   crypto  bros  and  Julie  uh  resigned.   Exactly.  That's  what  happened  guys.   >> Okay.  Well,  it  was  fun  while  it  lasted.   Um  okay.  And  that  takes  us  to  uh  well   let's  have  a  bit  of a  look  ahead.  So,  as   Nick  pointed  out  at  the  top  of  the   stream,  today  is  President's  Day.  What   do  you  What  do  you  Americans  do  on   President's  Day?  Is  it  just  an  excuse  to   get  drunk  again  or  do  you  do  you  erect   effiges  of  your  favorite  president  and   then  burn  them?  How  does  it  work  over   there?  What  do  you  What  do  you  do?  I   >> I  really  wonder.  Yeah,  I  mean,  Trump  is   obviously  getting  involved  in  some  of   these  crypto  crypto  pump  and  dumps   there.   >> We've  also  got  the  FOMC  minutes  coming   out  on  Wednesday  and  the  PCE  inflation   numbers.  So,  we'll  get  back  onto  those   in  a  bit.  Quickly  taking  a  look  at  the   charts  on  the  weekly.  This  is  a  very   important  chart.  This  basically  shows   that  this  is  it's  not  looking  good.  I'm   just  going  to  be  straight  up  guys.   Firstly,  it's  the  fourth  weekly  negative   close.  So,  the  fourth  weekly  down   candle.  It's  also  the  fourth  weekly   close  below  the  100  week  moving  average.   And  it's  also  the  first  weekly  close   below  the  previous  alltime  or  the   previous  cycle  all-time  high.   >> So,  the  trend  is  not  our  friend.  And  if   all  indications  are  as  they  are,  it   seems  we  could  potentially  that  that  200   week  moving  average  uh  down  there  at  the   the  60k  level,  but  slightly  below  the   60k  level  could  be  the  next  target  in   the  next  few  weeks.  Um  and  then  another   thing  to  reinforce  that  is  the  onchain   levels.  And  this  is  particularly   interesting.  This  is  the  uh  cost  basis   distribution  heat  map.  Basically  shows   the  price  at  which  a  lot  of  coins  were   traded  in  the  past.  Uh  it's  you  can  see   the  the  warmer  the  color,  the  more  coins   were  traded.  And  we  currently  now   holding  between  this  uh  60  to  uh  70k   level  which  basically  if  you  look  at   that  previous  dist  um  zone  back  in  the   previous  2024  there  was  a  lot  of   distribution  of  coins  uh  due  in  in  that   price  range  and  so  far  we  holding  within   it  which  means  that  there  are  buyers   stepping  in  at  this  level.  Hopefully,  we   hold  it  because  if  we  do  fall  below  60K,   you'll  see  there's  that  big  blue  ocean   over  there.  That's  quite  deep.  And  that   basically  shows  there's  not  been  a  lot   of  uh  trading  in  those  levels  recently.   And  as  a  result,  it  could  we  could  go   into  a  bit  of  a  trap  door.  So,  let's   hope  we  hold  within  this  range  at least   for  the  next  few  days.  But  uh  if  you   guys  are  looking  to  trade  these  markets   um  and  you  and  you're  bullish  or   bearish,  whatever  which  way  you  want  to   go,  uh  the  best  place  to  do  it  is  on  uh   Tubbit,  which  is  a  top  tier   international  exchange  and  one  of  our   brand  partners  over  here.

Uh  Nick,  I'm   going  to  give  you  a  rundown  of  the   sentiment  in  the  comments  here.  Um  just   this  is  how  far  uh  crypto  has  come.   Space.youtube  is  just  here  for  the  goat.   >> So  you  know,  not  even  here  for  the  top   notch  crypto  knowledge.  Don't  don't   Yeah,  I  think  the  greatest  of  all  time.   I  think  he  must  space.  I'm  I'm  I'm   flattered.  I'm  flattered.  Um  uh   meanwhile  Brett  uh  good  old  reliable   Brett  as  ever.  I  mean  this  is  this  is   one  of  the  more  principal  ones.  Brett's   comments  today.  If  anyone  can  get  it  to   zero,  it's  you  guy.  Thank  you,  Brett.   It's  I  It's  you.  I  do  it  for  um  uh  some   questions  about  the  coffee  as  well.  Have   the  beans  passed  through  the  gut  of  a   rodent?  Uh  yeah,  obviously.  Obviously,   Dre,  come  on.  What  do  you  think?  We  are   >> a  rodent.  Gutter  rodent.   >> Yeah,  I  think  um   >> isn't  there  But  isn't  there  like  a  civ?   That's  not  a  rodent.  A  civet  is  a  cat.   >> No.   >> All  right,   guys.  Let's  go.   >> Welcome  to  Coffee  Bureau.  Today  we  are   talking  about  if   >> which  correct  piece  of  animal  does  a   coffee  bean  need?  Who   >> honestly  eats  a  coffee  bean  out  of  the   rodent  out  of  the  like?   >> Let's  move  on.   >> Let's  move  on.  Let's  move  on.  Um   Alexander  the  Beast.  That  is  a  great   name.  I'm  not  celebrating  any  president.   Um  so,  uh  yes,  a  few  a  few  bits  about   this  Dan.  Uh  nobody  celebrates   President's  Day  in  my  62  years.  Um  it's   a  fake  holiday  made  to  replace  the   birthdays  of  Washington  and  Lincoln.   That's  disappointing.   >> I  thought  I  I   >> think  about  it.  No  fireworks,  nothing   like  this.  Fourth  of  July.  No,   >> no,  apparently  not.   >> No  parade  for  his  excellency   dye  like  I  know  they  dye  the  Chicago   River  green  on  St.  Patrick's  Day.  I   mean,  could  you  dye  um  the  PTOAC  red,   white,  and  blue  or  something?  I  don't   know.  Come  on,  America.  Sort  it  out.   >> Um  okay.  And  some  here's  some  here's   some  useful  perspective  from  Christopher   P.  Sounds  like  a  sounds  like  a  good   upstanding  person.  Christopher  P.  I   first  bought  BTC  in  2015,  £2,000.   Within  five  days,  it  dropped  to  £400.   Sit  tight  and  hold  your  nose  or  buy  more   if  you  can.  Chris  in  London,   >> hold  your  nose,  cover  your  eyes,  and   >> yeah,  we've  been  here  before.  We've  been   here  before,  I  think,  is  uh  is  what  is   what  Chris  in  London  is  trying  to  say.   So,  uh  yeah,  some  much  needed   perspective  there.  Okay,  so  that  is  the   sentiment.  as  ever.  You  guys  are  doing  a   great  job  of,  you  know,  even  in  tough   times  like  this,  keeping  the  uh  keeping   the  the  the  the  sentiment  up.  Love  to   see  it.  Okay.  Um  now  we  this  is  a  story   we  we  debated  whether  to  talk  about  this   um  because  you  know  on  the  one  hand  it's   you  know  it's  not  the  biggest  crypto   story  perhaps  of  all  time.  Um  but  it   really  did  sort  of  spark  quite  a  lot  of   debate  in  the  office.  So  we  thought  we   better  talk  about  it  uh  on  the  news  this   week.  So,  um,  Nick,  can  you  can  you  fill   us  in  sort  of  on  what  basically  went   down  here?   >> Imagine  guys  getting  sent  2,000  Bitcoin   accidentally  to  your  uh  your  exchange   account.  What  would  you  do?  What  was   your  first  reaction?  You  see  2,000   Bitcoin  in  your  exchange  account  because   this  is  what  happened  last  week.  So,  it   got  it  actually  got  a  lot  of  mainstream   press,  which  isn't  the  best  thing,   >> but  um  so  what  exactly  happened?  So,   this  is  Bit  Hump,  which  is  one  of  the   biggest  Korean  crypto  exchanges,  and   they  had  this  random  box  promotional   event,  and  they  intended  to  reward  695   users  with  a  small  cash  prize  of  2,000   Korean  one.  For  rough,  for  reference,   that's  roughly  $1.40.  I  don't  know  why   on  earth  anyone  would  be  happy  to   receive  a  $1.40  gift  to  be  honest,  a   promotional  gift,  but  whatever.  Mhm.   >> Um,  however,  a  staff  member  accidentally   set  the  reward  unit  to  Bitcoin  instead   of  one,   and  as  a  result,  winners  were  credited   with  at  least  2,000  Bitcoin  each,  which   is  approximately  $140  million  per  per   person.   >> Oh  my  word.  Yes.  So,  uh,  yes,  that's  a   great  that's  a  great  roundup  of  it,  uh,   Nick.  So  yeah,  um  as  we've  seen  that   this  kind  of  made  uh  this  kind  of  made   the  mainstream  news  headlines,  which  was   really  frustrating,  wasn't  it?  Because   this  is  this  is  the  sort  of  crypto  story   that  the  mainstream  media  absolutely   loves,  you  know?  It's  like  when  when   crypto  goes  bad,  when  someone  does   something  really  stupid.  Um  and  uh  and   this  was  it.  So  yeah,  I  mean  there  are   there's  so  many  things  to  sort  of  get   your  head  around  here.  It's  the  first   like  I  mean  just  like  they're  sending   out  like  what  is  it  a$140s  worth  of   rewards  and  it  you  know  that's  that's   what  they  meant  to  send  out.  It's  like   oh  thank  you  very  much  gosh  it's  I'd   rather  get  nothing  at  all.   >> I  mean  come  on  really  guys  honestly.   >> Um   >> what  is  with  these  stupid  exchanges   sending  $140  rewards.  You  I  mean  rather   90k  in  trading  rewards  and  don't  forget   two  bit  guys  and  scam.   Seamless,  Nick.  Seamless.  Um,  yeah.  So,   um,  yeah.  So,  they  they  did  you  talk   about  how  they  how  they  got  around  this?   >> Well,  first  of  all,  okay,  so  basically   just  to  in  context,  guys,  that  this  they   accidentally  in  their  own  systems   distributed  technically  in  terms  of  what   was  given  out,  620,000  Bitcoin,  which   represents  roughly  3%  of  the  total   Bitcoin  supply.  It's  worth  noting,  of   course,  they  don't  they  didn't  hold   that.  It  was  just  an  internal  system.   >> Mhm.  So,  obviously,  what  do  you  So,  guy,   what  do  you  do  if  you  see  you  got  2,000   Bitcoin  sent?   >> I  mean,  I'm  with  a  lot  of  people  in  the   comments  here,  as  we  we  we  had  a  bit  of   an  argument  about  this  earlier,  didn't   we?  But  like,  if  if  that  happened  to  me,   I  would  I  would  start  withdrawing.  I   would  like  obviously  if  you  tried  to   withdraw  206  to  your  gold  wallet,  that   is  going  to  flag  up  KYC,  AML,  all  that   sort  of  stuff.  But  I  would  I  would,  you   know,  I  would  go  with  you,  you  know,  if   if  it's  in  my  if  it's  in  my  wallet,  it's   uh  you  know,  my  keys,  my  coins.   >> They're  gonna  the  moment  that  happens,   they  got  your  KYC  documents,  you  get  in   legal,  you  get  in  legal  cases  sent   against  you.  But  anyways,  what  they  did,   what  did  happen  was  a  lot  of  these  guys   who  saw  they  got  this  and  thinking  it's   too  good  to  be  true,  they  what  am  I   going to  do?  I'm  going  to  cash  out.  So   they  dumped  their  Bitcoin  on  their   internal  order  books.  And  if  you  dump  in   that  much  Bitcoin  on  their  internal   market  maker  order  books,  it's  going  to   do  something  to  the  price.   >> Yeah.  So,  we  saw  basically  a  localized   flash  crash  on  Bithham.  Um,  at  the  time,   Bitcoin  was  trading  at  around  7  $70,000.   Um,  Bithham,  it  actually  went  down  to   $55,000.  That's  a  17%  plunge  on  uh  on   this  one  exchange.  Imagine  if  you're  the   guy  who  buys  who  it  goes  down  to  55K  and   you're  like  a  random  other  user  and  you   see,  oh  my  god,  Bitcoin's  down  to  55K   and  it's  on  trading  on  70k  on  an   international  exchange.  I'm  going to  go   and  buy.   >> Then  you  have  to  reverse  those  orders  as   well.   >> Kimchi  premium  is  back.  Let's  load  up.   Um  absolutely  crazy.  So  um  so  basically   uh  Bitum  managed  to  successfully  recover   um  this  was  what  was  reported  at  the   time.  Successfully  recover  99.7%   of  the  mistakenly  sent  funds.  Um  they   did  this  mostly  by  basically  reversing   internal  ledger  entries.  So  they  just   kind  of,  you  know,  tweaked  the  books.   >> Yeah,  exactly.  Um   >> um  for  the  accounts  that  hadn't  moved   the  coins,  but  um  some  actually  had  and   there  was  a  great  quote,  I  think  it  was   in  the  Guardian  article  um  which  we  may   have  quoted  on  the  uh  on  on  the  Tik  Tok,   but  uh  they  said  um  that  they  were  uh   having  basically  Oh  yes,  the  exchanges.   So,  this  is  from  the  Guardian  article   reporting  this.  The  exchange  is  now   holding  what  it  described  as  one-on-one   persuasion  talks  with  roughly  80   customers  who  cashed  out.   >> Come  on,  guys.  Let's  talk  about  this.   Please,  let's  talk  about  this.  Pretty   please.  You  got  to  come  in  for  a  nice   chat  in  the  office.  We  can  have  a  chat.   >> I  mean,  I  just  imagined  this  I  just   imagined  these  talks  as  sort  of,  you   know,  starting  off.  It's  like,  please,   please  just  give  it  back.  Please.  And   then  it  just  gets  escalated  further  and   further  up  the  chain  of  command.  Bithham   CEO  is  basically  screaming  at  them  down   the   >> or  basically  because  they  have  your  KYC   information,  you  get  a  knock  on  the  door   with  some  a  few  a  few  heavy  set  guys   basically  like,  \"Yo,   >> you  know  those  bitcoins,  we're  going  to   need  those  back.\"  Um,  yeah.  So,  an   absolute  an  absolute  um  mess,  let's  say.   >> There's  also  regulatory  issues  there   because  it's  triggered  an  emergency   response  from  South  Korea's  regulators.   Regulators  launched  an  on-site   inspection  claim  citing  that  the  error   quote  exposed  the  vulnerabilities  and   risks  of  virtual  assets.  Again,  not  the   best  look  for  crypto.   >> No.  No.  Um  so,  uh  as  we  understand  it  at   the  moment,  a  just  over  100  uh  bit  BTC   will  withdrawn  and  remains  unreovered.   Um  Bit  Hum  obviously  has  begun  legal   proceedings.  Um  so  we'll  see  how  that   plays  out.  Um  I  mean,  you've  got  to  kind   of  side  with  the  little  guy  on  this  one,   haven't  you?   our  mistake.   >> I  mean,  no,  but  come  on.  You're  giving   like,  come  on.  It's  like  it's   >> I  think  they  should  let  them  keep  some   of  it.  I  think  they  should  let  them   like,  you  know,  at least  give  them  a   multiple  on  the  pathetic  amount  that   they  were  offering.   >> It's  not  like  they've  identified  a   vulnerability.  It's  just  they  were  lucky   guys  that   >> I  think  they  have  identified  a   vulnerability.  They've  identif   Are  we  back?   >> We're  back.   >> Oh  god.   >> Apologies,  folks.  We  see  we  seem  to  have   an  interruption  to  service.   >> The  same  guy.  Yeah,  we  got  bit  tech   support  on  the  on  our  Streamyard.  Um   >> BitM  executing  executing  a  DOS.  Yeah,   but  if  you  guys  if  you  guys  have  an   exchange  account  and  you  are  sent  2,000   Bitcoin  accidentally  and  you  do  want  to   store  it  in  a  cold  wallet  for   safekeeping,  we  couldn't  think  of  a   better  way  to  place  put  it  than  on  a   Tandem  hardware  wallet  device.  So,  these   are  your  all-in-one  crypto  solution  with   no  seed  phrases,  middlemen,  or   compromises.  Just  tap  and  go.   >> Yeah,  absolutely.  Couldn't  be  easier  to   set  up.  Um,  and  if  you  scan  the  QR  code   there,  you  get  a  10%  discount.  get   yourself  one  and  then  when  your  exchange   fat  fingers  you  2,000  BTC,  you  know   where  to  send  it.   >> Yeah,  there  we  go.   >> Um,  surely  the  big  winner  surely  uh   there  was  champagne  being  popped  at  the   upbit  offices  whilst  all  this  was   happening  was  because  Bitham  Bitum  if  I   remember  is  is  the  second  largest   exchange  in  in  South  Korea.  Up  is  by  far   the  largest  but  I  mean  they  must  be   absolutely  loving  it   >> possibly  or  I  mean  if  it  invites  a  lot   of  regulatory  scrutiny,  who  knows?   >> Yeah,  let's  see.  Okay,  so  we've  got  to   talk  about  this,  folks,  because  when  uh   when  Donald  Trump  won  the  election  um  in   November  of  2024,  uh  obviously  we  all   knew  that  he  was  pro  crypto.  He  he'd   shown  just  how  pro-  crypto  he  was.  And   uh  we  were  confident  that  he  was  going   to  put  his  money  where  his  mouth  was.   Crypto  prices  obviously  ripped  as  a   result.  Um,  and  here  we  are,  uh,  a   little  over  a  year  later  and  yeah,  the   vibes  ain't  as  good.   >> Definitely  not.  Especially  on  crypto   Twitter,  if  you  take  a  look  at  some  of   these  accounts,  um,  people  have  been   questioning,  there's  been  a  lot  of   people  questioning  whether  crypto  would   have  been  better  under  a  Camala   presidency.   >> Yeah.   >> Um,  and  uh,  I  mean,  it's  not  just   people's  sentiment  on  the  timeline.  It's   also  the  question  of  uh  and  this  is  of   course  relates  to  crypto  prices  because   you  know  Bitcoin  has  roundt  all  the   gains  since  Trump  was  elected  not  even   just  inaugurated.   >> Wow.  So  he's  all  the  gains  that  we've   seen  from  the  election  price  have  been   retraced  and  als  basically  didn't  even   have  much  gains  to  retrace  to  be  honest   because  it's  it's  you  had  a  one  a  little   little  bit  of  a  pump  in  November   >> but  since  then  it's  been  down  only  and   it's  pretty  much  in  the  down  there  in   Goblin  Town  for   >> Yeah.  Now  of  course  who  do  we  think  is   currently  sitting  sitting  back  on  their   laurels  feeling  pretty  pleased  with   themselves?  Oh,  no.  I'm  sure  he's  there.   He's  basically   >> he  is  how  fortunes  change.  You  know,   just  over  a  year  ago,  this  guy,  we  were   all  doing  victory  laps.  We  were  all   dancing  on  Gary  Gendler's  grave.   >> I  imagine  he  is  feeling  pretty  uh   >> vindicated  indeed.   >> Pretty  vindicated  now.  Yeah.   >> But  it's  not  just  Crypto  Bros  in   general.  I  mean,  I  found  this  pretty   crazy.  This  is  like  apparently  a  poll   over  the  weekend  over  the  past  few   weeks.  Uh  but  it  and  it's  and  Axio,  so  I   don't  I  mean,  take  it,  you  know,  take  it   for  what  it  is,   >> but  there's  some  majority  of  voters  say   that  Biden  was  better,   >> which  is  crazy.   >> Yeah.  Trump's  approval  ratings  not  great   at  the  moment.  Now,  look,  we  need  to  be   uh  we  need  to  be  fair  here  because  uh   Trump  and  his  administr  they  have  they   have  done  a  lot  of  pro-  crypto  stuff   there.  Stuff  has  happened  that  perhaps   we  we  definitely  wouldn't  have  seen   under  the  Biden  administration.  And  you   know  it's  it's  very  likely  we  wouldn't   have  seen  under  under  a  Kamala  Harris   presidency.  For  instance  uh  we  had  the   uh  the  Genius  Act  um  which  was  passed  uh   late  last  year.  Um  now  this  you  know   really  is  a  landmark  bill  uh  as  far  as   stable  coins  and  go.  We  also  got  a  pro   crypto  not  only  the  SEC  but  also  the   CFTC  as  well.  Um  the  SEC  obviously  as  we   as  we  just  referred  to  with  Gary  Gendler   was  raidly  anti-crypto  and  we  now  have   the  complete  opposite.   >> Yeah,  exactly.  Uh  and  we  also   potentially  well  I  mean  look  the  clarity   act  is  still  being  worked  on  as  we   discussed  earlier.  Scott  Besson  says   crypto  will  recover  if  clarity  act  is   passed.   >> Mhm.   >> Although  let's  be  honest  guys  as  we   mentioned  it  seems  unlikely  due  to  the   banks  that  are  blocking  the  provisions   around  stable  coin  yield.  Um,  and  yeah,   I  mean,  we've  got  to  get  this  done   before  February,  and  if  it  doesn't  come   before  February,  then  uh  I  think   midterms  will  take  priority.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  So,  it  does  very  much  feel   like  what  like  like  time  is  kind  of   running  out  um  to  get,  you  know,  to  get   this  this  last  bit  of  legislation   passed.  And  actually  talking  about  the   SEC,  you  know,  there's  been  there's  been   lots  of  talk  about  the  innovation   exemption.  This  was  this  was  going  to  be   a  period  of  time  whereby  it  was  kind  of   legal  to  do  anything  cryptoreated  in  the   US.  Now,  this  was  supposed  to  come  last   month.  Paul  Atkins,  pro  pro-  crypto  SEC   chair,  uh  was  talking  about  it  for  a   bit.  He  said  January  January  came  and   went.  Uh  we're  now  over  halfway  through   February.  There's  no  sign  of  it.  Um,  so   it's  all  very  well  kind  of  having,  you   know,  nice  words  and  nice  sentiment   talked,  but  at  the  moment  without  sort   of  positive  action,  it's  it's  it's   nothing  but  hot  air  really.   >> Oh,  yeah.  Words  are  bubbles  in  water  and   deeds  are  drops  of  gold.  Um,  so   >> poetic.  There  we  go.  Indeed.  Getting   very  philosophical  today.  Um,  but  I  mean   also  in  terms  of  what  we  did  get  be  not   just  the  the  bulls  that  did  pass.  We  got   u  multiple  uh  projects  um  you  know  meme   coins,  scandals,  questions,  negative   publicity  around  uh  presidential  uh  you   know  projects  and  potential  double   dealing  and  all  this.  And  let's  not  of   course  forget  the  the  meme  coins  that   Trump  that  launched  the  day  like  just   literally  before  the  inauguration  Trump   and  Melania  which  are  basically  we  can   we  can  call  these  rugs  straight  up  rugs.   I  mean  they're  not  going  anywhere.   >> Yeah.   >> Which  is  crazy.   >> Yeah.  Um,  and  yeah,  I  mean,  I  think  we  I   think  we  all  had  a  kind  of  sinking   feeling  when  that  Trump  memecoin  first   appeared,  didn't  we?  Because  that  was   that  was  that  came  during  the   pre-inauguration  ball  when  all  these   sort  of  crypto  bigwigs  had  gathered  and   suddenly  this  Trump  meme  coin  appears   out  of  nowhere.  And  I  guess  if  you  want   to  if  you  want  to  take  this  back,  if  you   want  to  pinpoint  a  moment  where  it   started  or  when  the  dream  kind  of   started  to  die,  that  was  it.  I  think  it   launch  of  the  Trump  memecoin   >> and  it's  and  unfortunately  the  public   perception  has  taken  a  massive  nose   dive.  I  don't  know  if  you  guys  are   watching  the  uh  Super  Bowl  last  week  uh   there  was  in  between  the  Bad  Bunny   performance.  Uh  there  was  a  ad  and  there   was  a  Coinbase  ad  that  basically  was  a   tech.   >> It  was  a  bit of  a  rug  pull,  let's  be   honest.  Actually,  it  literally  was   because  they  teed  it  up  with  a  sing   along  to  some  Backstreet  Boys.  But   anyways,  this  is  a  viral  clip  of  some  uh   people  watching  the  ad  at  home  and  uh   one  of  the  um  one  of  the  people  who   watching  when  they  noticed  it  was  a   Coinbase  ad,  they  voiced  their   displeasure  uh  in  a  particular  way.   >> Yes.  Yes.  It  uh  yeah,  it  kind  of  it  it   speaks  a  lot  about  where  we  are  at  the   moment.  And  you  know,  it's  I  I  kind  of   feel  that  say  what  you  like  about  the   the  the  Biden  administration  and  and  the   state  of  crypto  under  it.  was  tough,  but   crypto  kind  of  had  that  that  image  still   of  being  something  kind  of  something  the   out  something  for  the  outsiders,   something  that  was  that  was  def   something  almost  cool,  something  that   was  defying  uh  the  man.   >> Sticking  it  to  the  man  now.   >> Sticking  it  to  the  man  somewhat.  And  now   >> you're  being  rugged  by  the  man.   >> Now  the  man  has  rubbed  us.   >> That's  what  it  is,  girl.  So,  so  I  mean,   >> yeah,  it's  unfortunate.  Uh,  I  mean,  this   question  will  rage  a  lot  on  the  on  the   timeline  for  as  long  as  possible.  Uh,   we'll  have  to  see  how  things  turn  out   with  the  midterms.  Who  knows?  Uh,  but   irrespective  of  how  you  feel  about   crypto  guys,  understand  that  there  is   always  a  bull  market  somewhere.  And  if   you  don't  necessarily  want  to  trade   crypto,  you  can  still  trade  traditional   assets  like  stocks  and  commodities  on  an   crypto  exchange.  And  of  course,  one  of   the  best  places  to  do  that  is  a  BitGet,   our  second  brand  partner  here,  our  third   brand  partner.  So,  uh,  if  you  don't  have   a  BitGet  account,  you  can  create  one   right  now  by  scanning  the  QR  code  link   down  below.  And  over  there,  you  can  swap   your  USDT  and  trade  tokenized  gold  and   other  assets  like  stocks.  Uh,  and,  um,   you  basically  trade  directly  with  the   USDT  up  to  500  times  leverage  and  deep   liquidity.  um  cranky  as  well  as  50k  in   uh  potential  sign  up  off  bonuses  as   well.  So  it's  not  bump  level  stinginess   here.   >> Okay,   >> that's  good  to  know.  You  know,  I  I   should  say  as  well,  we  we're  pretty  sure   BitGet  aren't  going  to  actually  credit   your  account  with  2,000  BTC,  you  know,   just  to  manage  expectations.  Okay.   >> Um  okay,  it  is  time  now.  Last  week  we   sprang  a  TA  surprise  on  you.  Um,  we  had   uh  Aaron  uh  on  the  TA  instead  of  uh  our   regular  Lewis.  Um,  this  week  we  have   someone  different  for  you.   >> One,  another  person  from  the  coin  bureau   trading  family  has  decided  to  take  over   the  TA  today.  And  take  it  away,  Jordi.   >> What's  up,  guys?  Guys,  it's  Jordan  Crypt   here  with  a  quick  rapidfire  TA  update.   Starting  on  the  weekly  time  frame,  it  is   good  to  see  that  our  weekly  RSI  is   actually  sitting  in  the  oversold  area   and  it  is  rhyming  with  our  stoastic  RSI   in  that  oversold  zone.  The  stochastic  is   slowly  moving  towards  its  moving  average   and  a  breakthrough  of  this  moving   average  would  be  a  good  sign  for  upwards   momentum  and  a  possible  signal  of  a   reversal  and  a  continuation  of  this   regular  RSI  back  up  into  its  momentum   zone  towards  that  50  line.  The  last  time   our  weekly  RSI  did  come  into  this   oversold  zone  was  all  the  way  back  here   in  June  2022  down  at  around  $20,000.   This  is  a  good  sign  that  we  are  already   looking  oversold  for  the  RSI  up  here  at   68K.  Although,  please  be  aware  that  we   could  still  come  down  to  much  lower   levels  within  this  oversold  range.   Looking  at  my  favorite  indicator,  the   market  cipher  indicator  on  this  weekly   time  frame.  And  there  are  full  tutorials   on  these  market  cipher  strategies  on  the   coin  bureau  trading  channel.  Awesome  to   note  that  the  market  cipher  did  catch   the  bearish  divergence  all  the  way  up  at   $119,000.   Now  around  50%  up  in  profits  on  the   downtrend  on  spot.  Our  green  trigger   wave  on  the  weekly  then  managed  to  get   us  this  nice  uptick  of  about  14%.  And   now  we  are  seeing  the  continuation  of   this  red  dot  to  the  downside  at  the   break  of  our  bare  flag  pattern.  I  think   most  of  you  are  fully  aware  of  this  bare   flag  pattern  and  we  have  now  finally   reached  our  full  price  target  which  is   also  another  reason  why  we  could   potentially  see  a  reversal  from  these   levels.  Something  interesting  I  am   seeing  on  the  charts  here  and  I  don't   want  to  be  the  bearer  of  bad  news  but  if   I  see  a  pattern  I  have  to  bring  it  to   the  community  and  we  are  seeing  what   could  potentially  play  out  to  be  a   pretty  crazy  head  and  shoulders  pattern   with  a  lower  high  coming  in  for  the   right  shoulder  anywhere  in  the  next  few   weeks  to  months.  As  you  can  see  if  we  do   put  in  this  right  shoulder  this  is  an   extremely  bearish  price  target  and  as  we   know  with  Bitcoin  anything  is  possible.   This  price  target  would  bring  us  to  a   very  bearish  $12,000  level.  Personally,   I  don't  expect  levels  this  low,  but  we   have  to  be  aware  of  what  the  charts  are   telling  us.  Something  very  nice  to  note   here  on  the  weekly,  and  congratulations   to  those  smart  money  concept  traders  who   managed  to  get  the  sniper  entry  on  this   week  long.  There  is  a  smart  money   concept  order  block  tutorial  on  the  coin   bureau  trading  channel.  But  in  very   basic  terms,  we  saw  the  break  of   structure  here  to  the  upside  with  our   impulse  move.  And  our  last  red  candle   before  that  breakup  structure  was  this   dogee  candle  here.  And  as  we  can  see,   that  gave  us  a  beautiful  sniper  entry   right  at  the  tippy  top  of  our  bullish   OB.  Another  thing  in  my  opinion  to  be   very  aware  of  is  this  $86  to  $87,000   support  and  resistance  flip.  Here  we  can   see  support  established  broken  through   and  we  have  not  yet  come  up  to  properly   retest  that  and  flip  it  into  resistance.   In  institutional  trading  terms,  this  is   known  as  the  scene  of  the  crime  and  it   means  there  are  a  lot  of  big  orders  for   shorts  sitting  around  this  level.  And   one  of  the  reasons  why  that  level  is   acting  as  a  magnet  on  our  charts.   Something  else  most  traders  will   probably  be  aware  of  is  of  course  our   CME  gap  that  has  not  been  properly   filled.  I  like  to  look  at  these  gaps  on   the  4hour  time  frame.  And  we  can  see   here  that  there  is  still  an  imbalance  on   the  charts  and  this  is  one  of  the   reasons  our  84k  level  is  also  currently   acting  as  a  magnet  for  price.  And  this   will  be  a  nice  price  target  for  those   who  did  get  in  on  the  smart  money   concept  bullish  order  block  long.  Going   back  to  the  weekly  with  a  bit  of  market   structure  analysis  we  can  see  that  from   all-time  highs  we  have  now  dropped   around  52%.  Typically  historically  our   bare  markets  have  brought  us  down  from   all-time  highs  around  75%  within  that   last  year  of  the  4-year  cycle.  So,  if   history  is  going  to  rhyme  in  any  way,  we   should  have  at  least  another  25%  down   within  and  around  the  next  240  days.  And   that  brings  us  round  about  to  $44,000.   And  this  could  be  a  potential  bottoming   level.  We  did  see  our  fear  and  greed   index  go  all  the  way  down  to  five.  And   typically,  these  extreme  fear  levels  are   also  a  sign  that  we  are  coming  down   towards  whale  accumulation  zones.  Going   now  to  the  daily  time  frame,  it's  very   important  to  be  aware  of  your  fixed   range  volume  profile  on  your  micro  range   at  all  times.  And  it's  clear  to  see  now   that  we  are  hovering  around  the  POC,  the   point  of  control.  The  next  place  that  I   will  be  scouting  for  longs  will  be   within  the  value  area  low  of  this  range.   And  we  don't  currently  know  how  low  that   value  area  goes  because  we  are  currently   establishing  this  range.  And  clear  to   see  our  major  levels  of  volume  above  us   are  sitting  at  78,800.   A  nice  high  volume  zone  around  82  to   $84,000.  And  then  some  nice  high  volume   here  between  88  and  $91,000.  Those  could   be  some  nice  areas  for  sculps  and   potential  continuations  on  the   downtrend.  A  juicy  level  for  me  that's   looking  like  a  nice  potential  short   could  be  the  95,000  level.   >> Okay,  thanks  a  lot  Jordy  there.  Yeah,   that  was  an  in-depth  analysis,  the   in-depth  TA  over  on  just  Bitcoin.

Check  out  the  t  the   growing  team  of  gigab  brains  over  at   Coin  Bureau  Trading.  It  it  occurs  to  me   that  the  um  uh  the  sort  of  TA  section   that  we  have,  you  know,  whether  it's   being  delivered  by  Jordi  or  Aaron  or   Lewis  or  whoever,  it's  a  bit  like  it's  a   bit  like  the  kind  of  weather  section  of   the  news,  isn't  it?  The  mainstream  news   like  sort  of  diagrams  this  might  happen.   >> The  forecast  exactly  and  the  different   personalities  of  and  you  know  the   different  uh  Yeah.  I  mean,   unfortunately,  the  weather  reports  not   been  too  good  more  recently.   >> Indeed.   >> It's  a  bit  like  a  British  weather   forecast.  Like  it's  like  it's  like  Louis   Lewis  doing  the  US  weather's  like  ah   it's  too  I'm  just  going to  go  and   take  a  look  at  the  Brazilian  weather   right  now  when  he  goes  to  metals.   >> Just  going  to  see  what's  happening  in   Brazil.   >> Yeah,  in  Ecuador.  Um  yeah,  it's  uh  yeah,   the  the  the  crypto  weather  is  a  bit  like   the  weather  in  Britain  now.  You  know,   there  are  some  parts  of  Britain  that   have  had  rain  every  single  day  this  year   so  far.   >> Really?   >> Yeah.   >> Really?   >> Yeah.  There's  a  weather  front  sort  of   stuck  over  the  UK.   >> Oh  my  god.   >> Um  so  yeah,  fortunately  I'm  not  there.   Um,  okay.  Uh,  let's  now  have  a  look  at   some  tweets  of  the  week.   >> Yep.  Cool.   >> So,  this  is  the  context  of  of  this  one.   I  don't  know if  you  guys  saw  this  video.   Uh,  it  was  Michael  Sailor  being   interviewed  on  CNBC   >> and  uh,  essentially  he  was  basically   they  were  asking  him  for  hypothetical   scenarios.  What  happens  if  Bitcoin  goes   to  particular  levels?  And  he  he   begrudgingly  answered  one  question  and   he  said  you  know  we  we  are  okay  even  if   we  go  down  to  8K  um  which  prompted  a   question  from  and  then  he  said  if  we  get   down  to  8K  it's  fine  no  problem  we  can   just  refinance  the  debt  and  um  you  you   know  trying  to  refinance  billions  and   billions  of  dollars  of  debt  with   collateral  that's  worth  a  tenth  of  that   is  probably  she  going  to  be  a  little  bit   of  an  upset   >> anyway  she  asked  him  refinance  where   Michael  and  then  he  answered  and  you   know  but  the  point  of  the  matter  is  it's   become  a  bit  of  a  meme  especially  her   reaction  in  that  in  that  particular   question.   >> So,  refinance  where  Michael.  So,  yeah,   Santa  has  not  had  a  good  week  last  week.   >> Her  face  is  priceless,  isn't  it?  It's   like   >> what   >> exactly?   >> What  the  hell?   >> Okay.  Uh  so,  uh  Michael  Sailor,  our   patron  saint,  still  flying  the  flag   there.  Um  next  up,  we  have  uh  this  one   from  Hugo  Martingale.  um  predicting  how   uh  how  crypto  might  react  um  if  we  get  a   change  of  administration.   >> Yeah.  So,  also  a  bit  of  context  guys,  if   you  haven't  been  seen,  uh  SBF  has  been   glazing  Trump  on  the  timeline   essentially  trying  to  uh  um  Yeah,   essentially  trying  to  get  a  a  pardon  by   the  end  of  this  year.  He's  probably   going  to  be  the  only  crypto  bro  still   supporting  Trump.   >> Yeah.   >> To  get  that  pardon.  Him  and  his  and  his   sons.   But  yeah,  this  is  the  this  context  that   this  is  what  happens  if  it's  in   Elizabeth  Warren  presidency  in  the  2028   election  and  he's  looking  for  a  pardon.   Going  to  go  over  there.   >> Yeah.  Canny  guy  SBF.  Um  all  right.  Uh   next  up  we  have  uh  this  one  from  um   who's  this  one?   >> Bashara.  So  basically   he  says  you  need  to  make  your  own  exit   liquidity  guys.  If  you  if  you're   struggling  to  find  exit  liquidity,  you   can  make  your  own.  And  uh  essentially   here  is  a  scene  and  this  must  be  a  real   scene  of  some  guy  basically  doing  a   presentation  out  in  the  old  age  home  in   the  retirement  village  and  the  granny's   and  grandpas  watching  how  to  trade   crypto.  So  he's  trying  to  engineer  his   own  exit  liquidity  and  uh  yeah  I  mean  if   there's  nobody  else  who's  watching  your   streams  anymore  on  um  on  on  YouTube  or   on  Twitter  or  anything  you  just  go  to  a   captive  audience  who  can't  basically   leave  because  they  can't  move.  And   >> coming  soon,  Coin  Bureau  presents  Crypto   for  Seniors,  coming  to  a  retirement  home   near  you.   >> What's  this  on,  sweetie?  I  thought  I  was   watching  The  Bold  and  the  Beautiful.   >> Okay.  And  we  also  have  uh  this  tweet   here  from  uh  who's  this  one  from?  Oh,   okay.  So,  this  is  um  this  is  Nick  Carter   replying  to  Sam  Alman.  So,  um  do  you   want  to  give  the  context?  context  is.  So   this  guy's  um  the  uh  Peter  Steinberger   is  the  guy  who  created  the  Claudebot   that  open-  source  uh  AI  tool  that  it  was   gone  went  viral  over  the  past  two  weeks   fork  of  um  and  utilizing  Claw  Claude's   code  and  essentially  um  he  the  long   story  is  he's  he'd  been  pested  by  a  lot   of  crypto  community  members  who  wanted   him  to  launch  a  memecoin,  join  their   memecoin,  potentially  earn  some  fees   from  the  memecoin,  get  a  get  a  bag  in  in   crypto  terminology  of  this  memecoin  and   he  basically  was  he  was  pested  uh  and   harassed  to  exhaustion  and  he  was  even   on  quoted  on  the  Lex  Freedman  podcast  as   saying  that  it  was  the  worst  form  of   online  harassment  he's  ever  had  is  ever   and  that's  because  they  also  sniped   domains  they  sniped  names  and  all  this   kind  of  stuff.  So  essentially  he  said   out  to  to  hell  with  a  and  he's   basically  gone  and  joined  open  AI  and   the  funny  the  funny  comment  there  from   Nick  Carter  is  basically  uh  and  people   were  telling  him  to  cash  out  by   endorsing  a  memecoin.  Yeah.  I  mean,  a   200k  cash  out  versus  a  multi-million   dollar  deal  to  join  OpenAI.   >> Sure.   >> Wow.  The  Crypto  Bros  unleashed.  Yeah.   God,  that's  that's  really  cringe,  isn't   it?  Um,  now  folks,  uh,  I  know  that,  um,   uh,  you  may  be  thinking  that  the  video   quality  has  diminished.  It's  not,   actually.  It's  just  the  fact  that  your   eyes  have  teared  up  because  you're  just   watching  us  through  tears.  It's  nothing   to  do  with  the  video  quality.  Um,  cheer   up,  guys.   >> Yeah.  Cheer  up.  Come  on.  It's  not  that   bad.  It's  not  that  bad.  Um,  okay.  Uh,   Nick,  do  you  want  to  quickly  give  us   some  dates  for  the  diary?   >> So,  on  the  February  the  18th,  uh,  we've   got,  uh,  the  FOMC  minutes.  Uh,  these   will  be  closely  scrutinized  as  markets   search  for  deeper  insights  into  the   Fed's  economic  outlook  and  policy   direction,  particularly  any  details  that   have  not  been  fully  revealed  during  the   January  meeting.   >> Okay.  Um,  20th  of  February,  we  have  the   core  PCE.  Um,  2.8  is  expected.  Um  and   then  what  2.9  for  2.8  is  the  headline.   >> 2.9  is  the  2.8  is  the  headline  expected   and  then  2.9%  is  expected  for  core.  And   then  we  also  on  the  February  20th  we've   got  uh  GD  Q4  GDP  numbers   >> and  again  potentially  uh  a  settlement  of   well  a  judgment  in  the  tariff  case  uh   from  the  Supreme  Court.  So  there's  a  lot   to  look  forward  to  on  the  February  the   20th.  So  put  that  in  your  calendar  guys.   >> Absolutely.  Absolutely.  Okay.  Um  well,   yes,  we  do  apologize  for  the  quality  of   the  stream.  Not  quite  uh  not  quite  sure   why  that  is,  but  um  X  is  down  also,  so   people  haven't  been  able  to  watch  us  on   X.  Um  uh  Dre  said,  I'm  not  sure  what  Dre   is  referring  to  here.  Yes,  guy.  It's   been  awful.  Is  that  the  stream  or  the   weather  in  the  UK?  I'm  not  sure.  Um  and   uh  I  know  there's  been  a  bit  of   speculation.  Don't  worry,  folks.  Lewis   uh  will  be  back.  He's  just  taking  uh   he's  just  taking  some  time  out  to  sort   some  stuff  out.  um  you  know  probably  his   metals  addiction  among  other  things  and   he  will  be  back  with  us  soon.  Um  now   we've  got  we  we  got  a  coffee  update.   Nick,  are  you  ready  for  this?   >> Yeah,  tell  me.   >> I'm  I'm  sorry  to  say  that  you  may  have   actually  been  proved  right.  Copy  luak  is   produced  from  coffee  cherries  that  are   eaten  partially  digested  and  excreted  by   the  Asian  palm  civet,  a  small  cat-like   animal  found  in  Indonesia.  I  knew   watching  all  those  days  the  National   Geographic  and  uh  David  Atenburgh's  you   know  break  the  breakdowns  pay  off  one   day  when  I  did  a  crypto  stream  talking   about  your  coffee  addiction  guy   >> your  childhood  wasn't  all  wasted  Nick   and  uh  Brett  as  ever  reliable  old  Brett   giving  us  some  uh  giving  us  some  extra   information  there  the  Asian  palivot   paradoxus  hemaphroditis   well  we  all  knew  that  Brett  come  on  come   on  add  something  add  something  more   >> all  right  um  so  we  will  leave  it  there   folks.  Um  we  will  be  back  next  week  with   a  better  quality  of  picture  I'm  sure   once  you  wipe  the  tears  from  your  eyes.   Um  and  lots  more  to  look  out  for  from   all  our  channels  over  the  week  too.  So   thank  you  for  watching  Nick.  Great  to   see  you  again.   >> You  too  and  guy.  You  too  guys.  And  see   you  next  week.   >> See  you  next  week.   >> Why  is  there  no  modernday  Monty  Python   with  Guy?  Nick  and  LMO   pre-  rich  and  now  poor.   Great  video.  I  do  enjoy  this  channel.   Don't  trip  by  the  dip.  Nick  aka  the   count  of  Monty  Crypto.   Where  in  the  world  are  you  watching   from?  Pits  of  this  fair  guy.  Secret   lair.
