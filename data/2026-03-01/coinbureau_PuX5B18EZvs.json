    "transcript": "On  the  30th  of  January,  Vitalik  Berin   posted  on  X  that  the  Ethereum  Foundation   was  entering  a  period  of  what  he  called   quote  mild  austerity.  He  framed  this  as   a  strategic  pivot  to  deliver  on  an   aggressive  roadmap  while  ensuring  the   foundation's  long-term  sustainability.   And  then  he  announced  something  that  on   the  face  of  it  seemed  like  a  confident   long-term  commitment.  He  said  he  had   personally  withdrawn  16,384   ETH,  worth  roughly  $43  million  at  the   time,  to  fund  a  suite  of  open-source   software  and  hardware  projects  spanning   everything  from  privacy  tools  and   encrypted  communications  to  biotech  and   secure  operating  systems.  The  funds,  he   said,  would  be  deployed  towards  these   goals,  quote,  over  the  next  few  years.   He  even  mentioned  he  was  exploring   decentralized  staking  to  generate   additional  runway  on  top  of  it.  Now,  the   market  reacted  exactly  as  you  would   expect.  ETH  dipped  about  7%  on  the  day,   but  the  long-term  framing  reassured  most   investors.  Austerity,  yes,  but  a   considered  strategic  multi-year   austerity.  The  Ethereum  Foundation  was   tightening  its  belt,  not  running  for  the   exit.  Analysts  praised  the  transparency,   while  community  members  called  it  mature   stewardship.  And  that  right  there  is   where  the  onchain  data  starts  to  tell  a   very  different  story  because  4  days   after  that  announcement,  the  selling   began.  Starting  on  the  2nd  of  February,   onchain  trackers  including  Look  onchain   and  Arkham  Intelligence  began  flagging   significant  ETH  movements  from  wallets   attributed  to  Vitalik.  Between  the  2nd   and  the  5th  of  February  alone,   approximately  6,183   ETH  were  sold  at  an  average  price  of   around  $2,140.   That  is  roughly  13.24  million  in  under  4   days.  ETH,  which  had  been  trading  near   $2,360   at  the  start  of  that  window,  fell  to   $1,825   by  the  end  of  it,  a  22.7%   decline.  Then  came  a  roughly  two-week   pause  before  it  started  again.  On  the   22nd  of  February,  Vitalik  withdrew  3  and   a  half  thousand  ETH  from  the  Ave  lending   protocol  and  began  swapping  portions  of   it  into  stable  coins  on  cow  protocol.   Over  the  following  2  days,  another  1,869   ETH  was  sold  worth  approximately  $3.67   million.  ETH  fell  5.7%  in  those  48  hours   alone.  And  by  the  24th  of  February,  the   running  total  had  climbed  to  somewhere   between  10,700  and  10,800  ETH  sold  this   month,  valued  at  approximately  $21.74   million.  Now,  I  know  what  you're   probably  thinking.  He  said  a  few  years.   He  sold  nearly  half  the  allocation  in  3   weeks.  Those  two  things  are  not  easily   reconcilable.  But  here  is  where  I  need   to  give  you  the  full  picture  because   intellectual  honesty  matters  more  than  a   clean  narrative.  The  sales  were  not   secret.  The  30th  of  January  withdrawal   was  a  public  announcement  on  X  cited  by   CoinDesk  the  block  and  Decrypt  within   hours  and  the  sales  are  not  going  to  a   centralized  exchange  to  be  cashed  out.   They're  instead  rooted  through  cow   protocol,  a  decentralized  exchange   aggregator  that  uses  batch  auctions   specifically  designed  to  minimize  price   impact  and  protect  against  the  kinds  of   front  running  bots  that  can  turn  a  large   sale  into  a  market  moving  event.  And   Vitalik's  remaining  holdings  around   224,000   ETH  worth  approximately  $416  million.  So   the  total  amount  sold  this  month   represents  less  than  4%  of  his  stack.  So   why  does  this  matter  at  all  if  the  sales   were  pre-announced  and  the  scale  is   relatively  small?  Well,  because  optics   are  a  force  multiplier  in  financial   markets  and  the  timing  here  not  great.   >> The  crypto  fear  and  greed  index  hit  an   all-time  low  of  five  on  the  6th  of   February.  as  in  five  out  of  100.  And  to   put  that  into  context,  the  index   bottomed  at  six  during  the  FTX  collapse.   So  sentiment  is  now  worse  than  it  was  in   the  wake  of  one  of  crypto's  biggest  ever   catastrophes.  ETH  has  fallen  45.7%   from  its  14th  of  January  price  of   $3,354.82   to  the  5th  of  February  trough  of  $1,823.   And  in  that  same  period,  ETH   underperformed  BTC  by  nearly  11   percentage  points.  BTC  fell  roughly  35%   from  peak  to  trough.  ETH  fell  45.7%.   That  gap  does  not  close  on  its  own.  It   requires  an  explanation,  and  the   explanation  is  partly  structural,  but   the  founder  selling  into  maximum  fear  is   the  match  thrown  onto  an  already  fuel   soaked  floor.  Okay,  now  let's  talk  about   what  that  selling  actually  triggered   because  the  direct  impact  of  Vitalik's   transactions  is  only  one  piece  of  a  much   larger  demolition  job.  On  the  1st  of   February  2026,  over  $2.5  billion  in   crypto  positions  were  liquidated  in  24   hours.  Ethereum  led  the  carnage  with   $1.15  billion  in  positions  wiped  out  as   it  fell  as  much  as  17%  in  a  single  day.   434,000   traders  were  liquidated  in  that  window.   Of  the  total,  roughly  93%  were  long   positions.  Now,  these  were  the  retail   investors  who'd  been  accumulating   through  the  late  2025  rally,  using   leverage  to  amplify  their  exposure  and   who  got  absolutely  hammered  when  the   floor  gave  way.  Then  on  the  5th  of   February,  a  second  wave  hit  over  $1.45   billion  in  additional  liquidations   across  the  market  with  ETH  long   positions  again  accounting  for  the  lion   share.  Now,  to  understand  why  these   cascades  happen,  you  need  to  understand   the  doom  loop  that  lives  inside  the   derivatives  market.  Here's  how  it  works.   At  50  times  leverage,  a  2%  price  drop   hits  margin  requirements  and  forces   exchanges  to  automatically  close   positions.  Those  force  closures  dumps   supply  onto  the  market,  which  pushes  the   price  down  further.  That  lower  price   then  triggers  the  next  layer  of  leverage   longs,  which  creates  more  force  selling.   Market  makers  trying  to  hedge  their   exposure  start  pulling  liquidity.  Retail   sees  the  red  and  joins  in.  And  spot   price  craters  even  though  the  original   selling  was  relatively  small.  It's  a   self-reinforcing  machine  and  it  runs   fastest  when  the  initial  sentiment  shock   is  something  emotional  like  for  instance   a  founder  selling.  Now,  even  though   Vitalik's  $21  million  represents  roughly   0.1%  of  Ethereum's  daily  trading  volume,   the  psychological  signal  it  sends  to  a   market  already  drowning  in  extreme  fear   is  worth  multiples  of  that  in  panic   selling.  And  speaking  of  tracking  these   moves  before  they  become  headlines,  this   is  exactly  why  you  need  the  Coin  Bureau   Telegram  channel  in  your  life.

So,  sign  up  today  using  the   link  down  below  or  by  scanning  the  QR   code  on  screen.  Now,  here  is  where  the   story  gets  genuinely  complicated.   Because  the  very  same  day  that  Vitalik   was  continuing  his  selling  on  the  24th   of  February,  the  Ethereum  Foundation   announced  something  that  the  founder  is   dumping  narrative  conveniently  ignores.   The  foundation  revealed  it  is  staking   approximately  70,000  ETH  with  all   staking  rewards  directed  back  into  the   treasury  to  fund  protocol  research,   ecosystem  development,  and  community   grants.  At  the  current  staking  yield  of   around  2.8%,  that's  roughly  1,966   ETH  per  year  flowing  back  into   operations.  And  crucially,  staking  is   not  selling.  The  principle  stays  locked   and  the  supply  is  removed  from   circulation.  The  opposite  of  dumping.  In   other  words,  it  signals  long-term   conviction  in  the  network's  proofofstake   security  model.  So  let's  be  precise   about  what  is  actually  happening  here   because  conflating  the  two  is  how  you   get  bad  analysis.  Vitaliputerin  is   selling  from  his  own  personal  wallet   through  a  philanthropic  vehicle  called   Kenro  to  fund  projects  he  publicly   committed  to  on  the  30th  of  January.  The   Ethereum  Foundation's  treasury  meanwhile   which  holds  approximately  172,650   deployable  ETH  is  not  being  sold.  It  is   being  staked.  Now  these  are  two  separate   actors,  two  separate  pools  of  capital   and  two  fundamentally  different   intentions.  The  legitimate  critique  is   not  that  Vitalik  is  betraying  the   network  but  that  selling  half  your   allocation  in  3  weeks  when  you  said  a   few  years  is  a  concerning  gap  between   communication  and  action.  And  when  the   market  is  in  extreme  fear,  that  gap  has   consequences  that  go  far  beyond  the   dollar  value  of  the  ETH  sold.  But  here's   the  harder  question  that  the  Vitalik   story  is  actually  masking.  Because  even   if  every  single  ETH  sale  stop  tomorrow,   Ethereum  has  a  structural  problem  that   no  staking  announcement  can  paper  over.   Cast  your  mind  back  to  March  2024  when   the  Denkun  upgrade  launched  EIP4844.   This  introduced  dedicated  blob  space  for   layer  2  networks  to  post  their   transaction  data  to  the  Ethereum  mainet   at  dramatically  reduced  cost.  The  stated   goal  was  to  scale  Ethereum  by  making   rollups  cheap  and  it  worked.  Layer  2   usage  exploded.  But  something  else   happened  at  the  same  time  that  nothing   in  the  marketing  materials  mentioned   prominently.  The  fees  that  layer  2   networks  had  been  paying  to  the  Ethereum   base  layer  absolutely  collapsed.  In   2024,  L2  Networks  paid  approximately   $130  million  to  Ethereum  in  security   fees,  representing  about  41%  of  their   total  revenue.  In  2025,  that  number  fell   to  $10  million.  Less  than  10%  of  their   revenue  is  now  going  back  to  the  base   layer.  The  remaining  $119  million  was   retained  as  profit  by  the  layer  2   operators.  base.  Coinbase's  layer  2   generated  over  $75  million  in  revenue   last  year.  Ethereum  mainet  meanwhile   generated  $39  million.  So  to  put  it   plainly,  Ethereum  built  the  highway,   paid  for  the  tarmac,  and  then  watched   the  toll  booths  get  installed  by  someone   else.  Meanwhile,  average  gas  fees  on   mainet  are  now  around  0.5  gay.  A  year   ago,  they  were  7.14  gay.  That  is  a  93%   collapse  in  the  cost  to  use  the  base   layer.  And  if  you're  wondering  why  the   ultrasound  money  thesis  has  gone  quiet,   well,  this  is  exactly  why.  ETH  is   supposed  to  become  deflationary  through   EIP1559,   burning  coins  with  every  transaction.   But  when  fees  are  near  zero,  burns  are   near  zero,  and  with  issuance  continuing,   Ethereum  is  now  mildly  inflationary.  The   supply  narrative  that  underpinned  a   significant  chunk  of  the  bullcase  is   currently  broken.  The  Faka  upgrade   introduced  a  burn  flaw  for  blob  fees  in   December  that  has  partially  addressed   this,  but  the  ultrasound  money  story  is   not  fully  restored.  And  you  can  see  all   of  this  reflected  in  the  ETH  BTC  ratio.   This  is  the  most  brutal  single  chart  in   the  Ethereum  story  right  now.  The  ratio   currently  sits  at  approximately  0.02.   0287.   The  10-year  average  is  0.044.   The  ETH  BTC  ratio  has  now  been  below   0.05  for  14  consecutive  months.  The  only   comparable  streak  in  Ethereum's  history   was  the  33-month  period  from  August  2018   to  April  2021.  In  other  words,  we're   approaching  the  duration  of  a  full   crypto  bare  market  in  terms  of  ETH's   relative  underperformance  versus   Bitcoin.  Now,  this  matters  enormously  to   the  institutional  story,  which  is  the   final  piece  of  this  picture.  Because   while  Vitalik  is  selling  from  a  personal   wallet  and  L2s  are  quietly  cannibalizing   mainet  revenue,  the  institutions  are   watching  all  of  this  with  billions  of   client  money  on  the  line.  Black  Rockck's   ETHA,  the  largest  spot  Ethereum  ETF,  has   seen  negative  one-month  net  flows  of   $819.96   million.  Its  year-to-ate  return  as  of   the  24th  of  February  stands  at  333.7%.   And  here's  the  number  that  should  make   every  ETF  holder  uncomfortable.  The   average  acquisition  cost  across  all   holders  of  spot  Ethereum  ETFs  is   approximately  $3,500   per  ETH.  So,  with  ETH  currently  trading   below  $1,900,   the  average  ETF  investor  is  sitting  on   unrealized  losses  of  over  45%.   Across  all  five  ETH  ETFs,  that's   approximately  $5.15  billion  in  paper   losses.  Bit  mine,  which  made  a   celebrated  pivot  to  an  Ethereum  treasury   strategy,  is  reportedly  sitting  on  a   paper  loss  of  roughly  $8.8  billion.  And   this  is  where  the  exit  liquidity   question  becomes  genuinely  uncomfortable   because  the  pattern  we're  watching  plays   out  in  crypto  with  grim  regularity.   Insiders  accumulate  early  at  prices   retail  never  sees.  Tokens  go  public  or   reach  all-time  highs.  Retail  floods  in   at  the  top  using  leverage.  Insiders   begin  to  gradually  exit.  Prices  fall.   Retail  gets  liquidated.  Insiders  are   out.  Now,  to  be  absolutely  clear,  that   is  not  what  Vitalic  Buteran  is  doing.   His  proceeds  are  publicly  committed  to   open-source  software,  privacy,   infrastructure,  and  biotech.  This  is  not   a  rugpool  and  not  personal  enrichment.   He  still  holds  224,000   ETH,  after  all.  But  the  optics  of  a   founder  selling  into  a  market  where   retail  is  underwater,  the  fear  and  greed   index  is  at  8  and  cascading  liquidations   have  wiped  billions  from  leverage   positions.  Not  great.  And  there's  one   more  element  to  this  equation  that   deserves  mention  because  it  arrived  on   exactly  the  same  day  as  this  story   reached  its  latest  chapter.  On  the  24th   of  February,  a  separate  whale  wallet   with  the  identifier  0x  EADC  offloaded   16,924   ETH  worth  $31.97   million  within  30  minutes  at  $1,889   per  ETH.  $32  million  of  Ethereum  sold  in   half  an  hour.  That  single  transaction   dwarfs  anything  Vitalik  moved  on  a  given   day.  But  this  is  the  environment  ETH  is   trading  in  right  now.  Multiple  large   holders  distributing  simultaneously  into   thin  liquidity  while  leveraged  retail   absorbs  the  impact.   >> What's  the  verdict?   >> Well,  let's  be  blunt  about  all  of  it.   First  off,  the  Vitalic  secret  dumping   framing  is  wrong.  The  sales  were   publicly  announced  and  the  mechanism   designed  to  minimize  market  impact.  His   remaining  holdings  are  enormous.  But  the   tension  between  a  few  years  and  3  weeks   is  real.  The  structural  challenge  from   L2  fee  cannibalization  is  real.  The  ETH   BTC  ratio  at  multi-year  lows  is  real.   The  $5  billion  in  ETF  unrealized  losses   is  real.  And  the  psychological  damage  of   watching  any  founder  sell  into  maximum   fear,  regardless  of  stated  purpose,  is   absolutely  real.  Now,  what  gives   Ethereum  its  long-term  case  is  still   there.  The  Glamsterdam  upgrade  targeting   Q2  or  Q3  2026  aims  to  increase  the  block   gas  limit  towards  200  million,  introduce   parallel  processing,  and  drive   meaningful  L1  activity  back  to  the  base   layer.  Black  Rockck  has  filed  for  a   staking  enabled  ETH  ETF  that  would   generate  yield  for  institutional   holders.  Standard  Charter's  year-end   target  remains  $75,000.   The  foundation  staking  70,000  ETH  is  a   genuine  long-term  conviction  signal,  but   conviction  signals  don't  pay  margin   calls.  And  right  now,  the  retail   investors  holding  leverage  long   positions  have  already  discovered  that   the  hard  way.  So  the  question  now  isn't   whether  Ethereum  survives.  The  network   is  as  technically  robust  as  it  has  ever   been.  No,  the  question  now  is  whether   the  people  who  believed  the  few  years   language  and  bought  Ethon  leverage  have   any  capital  left  to  participate  in  the   recovery  when  it  eventually  comes.  But   what  do  you  think?  Is  Vitalik  justified   in  selling  at  this  pace  to  fund  his   development  commitments  or  does  the  few   years  framing  demand  a  much  slower   timeline?  Let  me  know  in  the  comments   down  below.  If  you  want  to  understand   what  the  institutional  ETF  flows  are   actually  signaling  for  Ethereum's   recovery  timeline,  then  check  out  our   video  on  that  right  over  here.  And  if   you  want  to  see  how  Ethereum's  layer  2   competition  is  reshaping  which  chains   actually  win  in  2026,  well,  that  video   is  right  over  here.  Okay,  thank  you  all   for  watching  and  I'll  see  you  again   soon.  This  is  Guy  signing  off.",
