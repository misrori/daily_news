        "transcript": "This here pisses me off. And I'll tell you why. JP Morgan is warning their institutional clients. Bank of America is warning their institutional clients. Goldman Sachs are warning their institutional clients about the following that nobody seems to really understand. While we're all celebrating GDP data that is just fake, just nonsense. And it annoys me because the institutions always have this information edge, this understanding edge and it doesn't get passed on to us because mainstream media spews whatever the heck they want. So let me take a few minutes. I'm going to walk you through the data points. I'm going to put the charts on the screen here for you. This will be brief. This will be to the point. And it's not a doom and gloom video. By the way, there's some good news here. So stick around. This is not a oh my god, it's all over kind of clickbait nonsense. This is Winston's research. And you you know you know you can trust that knows. So, what have we got? We've got eight straight months in a row here where hedge funds are incredibly bullish. They're so bullish. They're not just using their own money, you know, they're using everybody else's money, too. They're leveraged to the hilt. Insane level of bullishness there. And that means there is risk because they can't get much more bullish. They can really only get more, you know, cautious. And then we have the S&P. Eight months of bull market. We've all forgotten about the almost it liberation day. Let's make American investors poorer again. Um and and and that's all behind us and you know we're on this incredible rally. It's the longest winning streak since 2018. That year obviously was a good one, wasn't it? Um Goldman's got a an indicator that says it's the it's their sentiment indicator. Basically, how's everyone feeling? institutional money mostly, but also you and me. And guess what? It's stretched. It is stretched. What does that mean? Well, it means people are pretty freaking bullish and it's harder to get a lot more bullish, right? JP Morgan, they have an hedge fund indicator and they're saying, look, they're insanely bullish right now. I'll put the chart on the screen here for you. That's from JP Morgan. And then look, before we talk about the GDP number, which is what lifted the market yesterday, and I enjoy the rally. I mean, I make money out of rallies, but that good news is something we need to break down because again, it's not what you think it is. Look, I'm actually bullish on this market. Like, just be honest about it, right? I'm so bullish, in fact, I just literally just invested yesterday a million dollars of my own money on a strategy that is the strategy that institutions use. It's the strategy that the smart money uses. And again, it pisses me off. They literally don't think you are able to understand it and implement it because they think they're sort of gold's gift to, you know, money. And if you look at this, actually a viewer of mine, he wrote a very, very nice comment. No dig against this chap. He's obviously a nice guy. He wrote, I'll printed it out here. He said, \"Haha, I'm trading on the VIX curve, which is one of the fundamentals of like the way we trade. Very good indicator. I'd say the only indicator needed, the only one.\" He said that. And then he says, \"Don't put investors into this. That's you. They would not understand a thing, right? Um, you need to be basically a market maker in a big bank or a hedge fund, right?\" And I wrote back, \"Well, I think you're spot on, but it's good job our head coach is a market maker. In fact, I've got three market makers on my team, and my mission is to spread that knowledge and that strategy. And I believe we've broken it down in a way that is so easy to understand, a complete novice can understand. I think I think I could teach it to a 10year-old and they do better than almost everybody else out there because it really is not complicated. So what my offer is to you is I'm going to walk you through how that works. You can judge for yourself. Like it's an experiment. I'm trading the way the big boys trade. I'm using a million dollars of my own cash. I'm risking that. I could lose it all in theory. Right now we would still have the lights on. You know, my risk levels might be different to yours. So obviously don't just copy trade me. But what I'm saying is I'm going to break down that system, how it works. I'm going to do that for you between the holidays. So, 27th of December. It's a link down below, felix.org/webinar, and you can sign yourself up for a free seat. 3,000 people have already signed up for that. It's going to be a big one. It's going to be a fun one. It's going to be a a nice way to round out the year and spread the knowledge and quite honestly, just prove those backers on Wall Street wrong. Because managing your money well is not about being smart. Like I met a lot of bankers. They're not that smart. You know, I used to be one. Come on. Right. So, you know, Winston's a lot smarter than me. Anyway, so sign up for that. There's a free link down below. Let's go back to the GDP data. So, the market yesterday lifted very nicely. Brilliant. We're all happy about it. Why? Because the GDP data came in better than expected. So, the US economy grew more than expected according to the government. Now, if you actually dig into the data, what is the almost the entire GDP growth? Surprise. It's healthare. What do Americans spend on healthcare? It's not actually the drugs or anything. No, it's health insurance, which is, you know, why we're holding UNH stock. Again, not telling you to do that, but um it's been a bit it's done all right. Actually hasn't done that brilliantly. I'm still hopeful on that one. Why do you spend more money on health insurance? Is it because you just think the health insurers deserve a good year-end bonus? No. Because they increased their rates. So, the GDP, the US economy grew because your health insurance got more expensive. Does that sound like just madeup data, useless data, or does that sound like a strong economy? You got to judge that for yourself, but we just it's a load of nonsense. And then, yeah, the greed greed index is back in uh in in greed in greed, right? And there is something out here which is do you remember the Gordon Gecko that lovely film Wall Street the quote from him is the sheep gets slaughtered which is you're the sheep by the way that's the way they look at it from a Wall Street point of view you and me both and look everybody is bullish if you look at all the investment banks out there every single one is bullish on 2026 there isn't a single outlier everyone's saying the market's going to go up and everybody is basically saying the same thing. It's going to go up 15%. Now, are these guys usually right or wrong? I don't know why these banks employ these forecasters, you know, thumb in the wind economists, useless. But when everybody is bullish, it does concern me a little bit because I am also bullish and I'm thinking, am I part of the sheep? Am I going to get slaughtered? So how do we deal with that? We deal with that by understanding when institutions are getting worried about the market. You don't see it in the stock price necessarily, but there is another thing you can see it in. I'll break that down for you on Sunday uh Saturday even this the 27th. It's essentially the called the VIX curve. So maybe you heard of the VIX is a fear indicator, but it's also got a curve behind it, which is where it gets a little bit more complex. I'm not going to lie to you, but it's simple enough to understand. So I'll break that down for you. and and so at the moment I'm pretty aggressively positioned but if that indicator flips if that indicator changes and we've built our own on the basis of it and a bunch of 10 other things then I will move maybe half my money into cash and I be a lot more conservative and most retail investors never do that they don't know when to take profits and that's what it would be for me would be taking profits and going into safety right and and I think that's really something it's all about risk management it's not actually about just finding the greatest, you know, latest ship building uranium quantum stock in 2026. It's just about keeping these gains because we've got some beautiful years behind us. We want to make sure we hold on to that. But yeah, Bank of America says um their investor sentiment is the highest since July 2021. And after 2021, July 2021, we collapsed pretty harshly. It's higher than the 2018 tax cuts. It's just like it's pretty pretty insane actually. It's really only the 2010 we were a little bit more bullish than that, but it's pretty rare that we are this bullish. So, what is that saying to me? It's saying to me, enjoy this beautiful rally. Take all the money that the market gives you. The government's going to print loads of money that's going to go somewhere as in the market. Um, and if AI works out, I think there's a fair chance it will, brilliant. Um, there might be some wobbles. I'm not saying there won't be. There will always be wobbles. And a wobble could be a 20 or 30% draw down, by the way. Just a big wobble. Um, but if we can handle those bigger wobbles better and we can be less fearful because we understand the structure and we understand the fundamental strategy that Wall Street uses to deploy their money. I think we can potentially have a truly brilliant and exceptional 2026. And that's what I'm planning for. That's why I'm running this experiment with a million dollars. So, join me on the 27th after the Christmas holidays. Just roll yourself to the nearest screen. Uh, be on time. It could be that the room is full. Um, and therefore you want to be there on time. Don't be late. We're trying to figure out how we can make that room a bit bigger. At the moment there's a 3,000 limit and we've got 3,000 signups which is like super exciting. I I I love your guys' desire to learn, especially when I'm putting out something that the Wall Street guys say. It's too complicated for you, right? It's too complicated. You can't handle the truth. I think you can handle the truth. So, we're going to give it to you. Winston says, uh, what does Winston say? Winston, any thoughts, Winston? Any thoughts? He says, uh, have a very happy Christmas and enjoy the days. I hope they're peaceful and calm and not stressful for you. And I hope to see you back on the 27th. All the best. Look at this number. That is $1 million of my own cash. Well, about half of it. The other half is sitting with the bank that is meant to send it and they are making money off it in the process. Bastards. and"
