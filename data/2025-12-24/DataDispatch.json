        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. I hope everybody is having a good day this holiday week, especially with tomorrow. That's going to be a shortened trading session, uh, followed by Christmas, which of course the markets will be closed before, uh, we see them reopen on Friday. Uh, in terms of the broader market today, we have it basically closing at all-time highs. We're seeing a heavy rotation back into the MAG 7. Nvidia at a very interesting spot. And specifically, we'll be talking about Palanteer as it consolidates, possibly getting ready to gear up towards a $200 testing of a resistance point if the macroeconomic uh basically momentum move continues to be bullish. Uh what we've seen is a positive GDP report. Uh the market's trying to price this in with the changing in expectations for January interest rate cuts. And also on top of that, we're seeing some of the small cap stocks that we've been talking about that are announcing some major headlines, though some of these stocks aren't moving. What could this possibly indicate for the future? So, if you're a new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos. We're trying to hit 30,000. And I'm probably not going to make videos over the next 2 days just because we got the holidays coming up, markets are going to be closed. So, I hope everybody has a great Christmas, enjoys it, and we'll come back getting ready to go. Pop it up on the screen here. Let's talk about Palanteer right here at 193. Uh basically consolidating on the day, not making a ton of large movements. Uh in terms of where it's sitting at though, I do like this consolidation zone where it's taking a breather. Reason being is cuz Palanteer really likes to base out and has consolidated since September and even before that between this 170 and 185 zone. It loves this area. It likes to sit in here. we finally were able to break through some of this resistance at the 190 and now Palanteer is just chilling all right here at 194. So I think as as this base breaks out, you know, it kind of lays out here, that could mean a possibly bigger breakout if the move does actually come. Not all moves, just because we're seeing something technically doesn't mean it's actually going to come to fruition. Um, just looking into more of a bullish type of short-term prediction. The typical saying that we've seen technically, the longer the base, the bigger the breakout. Um, so what we've seen is just looking at order flow here, a lot of leaps coming in. Uh, possibly getting ready for a move in 2026. Um, I'm still bullish on Palenteer. Uh, not a ton of individual big headlines with the stock. Um, in the short term, I think we could be testing 200 in the near future. I don't know if that means, you know, before the end of the year or anything like that. just in the short term here within the next couple uh at least in the next month or two I think this could test 200 especially after it's had its last local kind of swing bottom here to the 150s before reaccumulating into this zone right here uh and now past its consolidation area talking about the market like I've talked about before in the beginning of the video we've seen a big rotation back into the mag 7s and that's what we've seen here uh especially with the index closing right here at 6900 and kind of like I talked talked about yesterday, you know, in terms of what I'm looking at, anything above the 6,800 support zone that the S&P 500 has been trading in for a while, and we recently had this dip back in here to, you know, 6,700. Now, it's back at market all-time highs. I like this personally in terms of the bulls having control. We see the S&P 500 is well above its 50 and its 200 moving day averages uh at its 50 right here at 6890. Basically, I really like this move. And couple that with how Nvidia is doing right now. Nvidia is also back above its 50-day right here at about 188. Nvidia comes up about 3% on the day and does a good job bringing some resiliency and holding up the market in terms of the broader index. Uh one of the big things that I think we saw that is causing some volatility within the markets of course was the GDP report that came in at 4.3% surpassing the Dow Jones consensus estimate of 3.2. 2%. Now 4.3% is quite well right here. This report had initially been delayed by the government shut down. Uh initially led traders to lower their expectations of interest rate cuts early next year. So what we're seeing is Fed futures, they're indicating still two rate cuts by the end of 2026. However, what we're seeing here on bar chart, the odds of a January rate cut have plunged below 15%. Um, so the market is probably pricing this in as we speak, especially with a pretty good GDP report. Now, there's some criticism and some skepticism behind this actual percentage that is reported, but nonetheless, here's the GDP report that came in and the economy looks like it is still doing uh quite well even with a lot of the naysayers out there and a lot of the top callers. So, depending on what kind of volatility is going to be coming in in terms of momentum here, we're not seeing a ton of movement within the small and the midcaps. However, the large caps, like I said, are doing a good job holding up the broader index. Um, speaking of some of the individual news that we've seen in some of the smaller caps, let's talk about Cipher. You know, recently I've been pretty bullish on Cipher and on the whole AI data center trade. Uh, some of the top stocks that I personally like right now in the AI data center are Nebius, Cipher, and IN. Now, specifically looking at Cipher right here and what we've seen here, Cipher has acquired a 200 megawatt Ohio State uh new uh aliasis, if I'm saying that right, I don't know how to pronounce that right, with secured power and PGM across um and access, which marks its first expansion outside of Texas. Now, in terms of kind of a geo kind diversification, uh, in terms of what Cipher is doing, this is great to see that we've seen a lot of these AI data centers within Texas specifically, we see its first expansion now outside of Texas. Uh, this positions here, Cipher, they say as a landlord in the AI utility era by owning power and its other sites are going to be renting it. Now, Cipher is doing a good job um executing these plans and what they're looking for is that quarter 4, I think, of 2027, I think I saw in the report, to become fully energized. So, um what we've seen though with Cipher is not really any movement, just up about 75% today. Uh you know, up about 12 cents, basically consolidating here at the 16s. Um in terms of a short term, looking at Cipher right here, it is both below its 50 and it's 200. It's 200 right now is at right here. This area 1640. I think once it recaptures this, maybe we'll have more bullishness back into Cipher specifically. However, I like it at least above the 14s. That's where we've seen some nice support that is held there above the 14s and some nice consolidation. So, um that's where if we see some bullishness kind of back into these midcaps or the even these smaller caps right here, you could see a possible push of 20. Um interesting to see some of the price targets out there. And specifically looking at IEN here, I like IEN above the 40s. Uh especially as recently, we've kind of had that triple bottom area um for I ren kind of the monthly look right here uh before we saw that nice dip here into the 33. And I think people that added here at 33 uh did a really good job kind of timing out that bottom. Uh currently I ran at 42. I like it here. I like it higher. Uh just thinking, you know, not that long ago Ian was up here in the 70s. So crazy to see here. Uh personally bullish on Cipher and Iran and do have personal exposure to that. Uh you know looking at ESTS right here this is still doing quite well especially with some large swings here. Uh you see AS right now in the overnight hours up about 3% currently at 8839. Uh the big news that we do have for that is they had launched sorry I had it on here I don't have it anymore but they officially I think had launched their bluebird satellite uh into orbit or it's basically right on track um and we have that is continuing to do a great job building out the cellular broadband network. Um tackling over here to cryptocurrency where you see Bitcoin and Ethereum basically not moving at all. uh just hanging out here. You got uh Ethereum at 3,000 right underneath 3,000. It does not want to hold that 3,000 floor and Bitcoin is also hanging out here at the same point in terms of yesterday's video. I think both of these cryptos right here, Bitcoin needs a recapture 90 hold there before we see some possibly reaceleration and momentum back into these names. And you know, Ethereum right here at 2900. Well, you see here the BNR, you know, Tomley is continuing to add Ethereum at a very rapid pace. really wants to get to that 5% is doing that quite quickly. Uh Bitmine here adding 67,000 Ethereum um adding 201 million to the massive Ethereum treasury. So, you know, Todd Lee typically is right on his price kind of targets and general direction. However, typically he's not right on the time. uh you know and I was listening to a lot of Tom Lee and actually took a lot of faith in this move what we've seen with this whole tokenization type of hybrid and kind of traditional finance synergizing with the whole decentralized type of economy right here. Uh and with BMR it's just kind of hanging out right here below 30s and 30s is this important area for BMR in terms of support even though the stock is heavily correlated to the price of Ethereum. Uh but nonetheless, you know, a lot of people I think have lost some faith recently in Tom Lee uh because of his end of the year price targets that he had for Ethereum and Bitcoin and you know in terms of those moves uh those could definitely you know happen I think at some time but uh people unfortunately are very unpatient impatient especially in the crypto space. So we'll see what happens. you know, I do have a little bit of exposure, but not too overweighted or anything like that because I'm more more bullish on the AI trade uh specifically looking at the technology that is showing massive improvements right now as we speak and the earnings are also reflective of that. So, uh you know, we'll see what happens. We'll come back here on Friday talking about that and then kind of get ready for the new year and depending on where these stocks are going to go. But right now, I like where the general direction is. The bulls have a strong take. Um, of course, we could get some pullbacks along the way, but I'll just be looking to add on those dips as the general trend is still looking long-term bullish towards me, you know. Peace out. Take care. I'll catch you guys later."
