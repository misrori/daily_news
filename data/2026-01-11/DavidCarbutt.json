        "transcript": "I've got three cracking clips for you today. One on how David Saxs is likely to be missing out on a billion dollars through his decision to be working with the US government. Secondly, Chimath on nobody being ready for what Elon Musk is potentially building here in 2026. And then a bonus clip for you guys at the end. Firstly, David Saxs and how he's potentially missing out on $1 billion. I devested my Gro shares as part of joining the government back in like February or March. >> Oh god. >> So, >> oh by the way, by the way, what would that cost you like what the last triple up? >> No, it was a small position that came from Grock acquiring Sunny's old company. We didn't invest in Grock. So, it wasn't big. But the point was >> Yeah. It's just another example of you sacrificing for the country, which I give you a lot of credit for. >> It's good for Sachs to put that on the record. >> Yeah. Well, it's just so ridiculous because I'm accused of somehow doing this job for money when it just keeps costing me money. >> It's negative money. >> XAI just raised an up round at twice the valuation >> from the last round and we had to divest that too. >> Yeah. No, no, we didn't sit it out. Hold on. Let's be clear. We didn't sit it out. We divested it. >> Oh, so you place the bet and then before you get to collect the ticket, you lose the last double up or triple up. The economic cost to Sachs will probably exceed a billion dollars by the time he leaves. >> Personally, this is crazy. I mean, people need to know this. It's a very important thing to put on the record. I think it's important for >> I think everybody should know. All these dumb reporters don't get it, but Sax has sacrificed >> financially an enormous amount to work on behalf of the government and the people. That's that's really amazing. It's fine. I wouldn't even say anything about it if it weren't for the fact that we got these mainstream media reporters lying and saying the opposite that somehow this job is making me money, >> right? >> I wouldn't say a word about it otherwise. >> The billionaires are evil narrative completely breaks down when you look at David Saxs losing a billion dollars in personal wealth to serve the government instead. For example, Sax sold his Grock position when he joined the government. Since then, Grock has run out massively, especially after Nvidia signed a $20 billion licensing deal. He also divested from XAI right before it doubled its valuation. Jim estimates that the total cost will exceed a billion from David Saxs deciding to divest. But the real kick in the nuts is meanwhile this is going on, mainstream media keeps accusing him of taking the job to enrich himself. Now for Sachs, the timing has been a little bit unlucky and it was him who personally decided to divest when he joined government. So he placed bets, watched them starting to pay off, then cashed out before collecting the money. So the Nvidia Grock deal, for example, Sax would have captured huge amounts of upside if he stayed in Silicon Valley. Instead, he's in government meetings while his former positions are making other people very wealthy. So the billionaires are greedy model can't explain this behavior. Sax has a very impressive track record. He built Yammer and sold it to Microsoft for over a billion dollars. He helped build PayPal, which helped create online payments. His firm Craft Ventures backs companies solving real problems. Wealth has followed him because the companies he's invested and worked on have solved actual problems. When you build products that millions of people use voluntarily, the money is a scorecard of the value delivered. That's different from rent seeking or monopolies or fraud. Are there bad egg billionaires? Of course, some people get rich through shady practices. You find bad actors at every income level, but painting all wealthy people as villains ignores the ones building useful things. Saxs could have stayed in tech, kept making money, avoided the stress of the government work. Instead, he's taking congressional hearings and bureaucratic meetings, and watching his net worth suffer as his portfolio companies grow without him. And he's also paying for the privilege. The media narrative is backwards. Reporters who don't understand startup equity write stories about supposed conflicts of interest. They assume everyone in the government is there to get rich. But Sax is losing dollar amounts on specific positions in real time because of his decision to work in government. Every funding round his companies raise is gains he hasn't captured. Every licensing deal is money he'll never see. The billionaires are villain story misses this completely. Someone here is taking massive personal losses because he thinks he can help fix actual problems. The makers and the builders create value. The more they contribute, the more they are worth. And sometimes they contribute by walking away from the money entirely. Next up, Chimath on his contrarian bet for Elon Musk in 2026. >> Chimath, biggest deal 2026. What do you got? >> It's not a specific deal, but it's an approach. I think that M&A cannot happen. And so it's the IP license M&A workaround. And I think you're going to see hundreds of billions of dollars of these kinds of deals. So this is the deal that Google did with Character AI. It's the same thing that they did >> Microsoft did it. Yeah, >> Microsoft did it. It's obviously what Nvidia did with Grock. Why are these deals happening? Well, if you just look at what Facebook tried to do, they tried to buy Manis for $2.5 billion. Manis was a Chinese company that then left China and essentially rebuilt itself as a Singaporean business. The Chinese have now said, \"We're going to look at this. They are going to actively import export controls. They're going to actively look at which technologies and even which researchers are working on things that are critical enough that it just can't go abroad in this existential flight that they believe they're in with the United States. The United States is an equivalent such position. All of this leads me to believe that traditional M&A is effectively dead. I think it's going to be impossible to get a large transaction done. So how will you do it? You'll do what Sundar did. You'll do what Satya did. You'll do what Jensen did. >> You'll do what we just did with scale AI. These huge licensing deals that basically replace M&A. And I think that that as a deal type >> will get better and more refined and tighter and better executed. We were the third or fourth of these kinds of deals and even the third or fourth iteration was quite good. By the time that you're into the middle part of next year and you've done 15 or 20 of these things, I think the lawyers that work on these things and the accountants will just be bulletproof. >> Chimath, which what's on your uh contrarian belief? >> Gosh, I have two. Well, I'll give you them both and you can just see. My contrarian belief number one is I don't think SpaceX will IPO. I think that it will reverse merge into Tesla and I think Elon will use it as a moment to consolidate control and power of his two seminal assets into one cap table. >> Oh my god, I love that. Wow. >> Well, he's talked about that before. He's talked about having a holding company for years of all of the collection. You could put Neural Link in there too, right, Jim? You could put in the Boring Company as well. >> Sure. I'm just giving you my contrarian take. There will be no IPO for SpaceX. I think it will just be it specifically will be a reverse merger. >> Elon's separate companies are starting to overlap in ways that make Jamal's prediction of a SpaceX Tesla merger actually increasingly logical. Jamath thinks SpaceX won't IPO but will instead reverse merge into Tesla. As a Tesla shareholder, I personally would be very happy with this. SpaceX has launch capabilities, satellites and Starink. Tesla has years of chip design experience. XAI has the models. These pieces could all fit together. Imagine space-based data centers powered by Starling connectivity using Tesla's chip expertise to run XAI's models in orbit. The synergies are real. Tesla spent years developing custom silicon for full self-driving. Those same chip design capabilities transfer to other compute inensive applications. SpaceX already launches payloads and operates a satellite network through Starink. XAI needs massive compute and has models worth running at scale. Stack them together and you've got vertically integrated AI infrastructure spanning from orbit to the ground here on Earth. Data centers on Earth face power constraints, cooling costs, and real estate fights. In space, you've got unlimited solar power, natural cooling in a vacuum, and no zoning boards. Latency may well be higher as the data centers could be physically away from the end user. But for certain workloads, training large language models, running simulations, processing satellite imagery, that doesn't matter. If SpaceX can launch cheap enough, the economics start making sense. A reverse merger gives Elon one unified entity. Right now, he's splitting time across multiple companies with separate boards and shareholders. Combining them creates efficiency and lets him move faster. Some Tesla shareholders would hate it because they bought a car company, not a space conglomerate, and others, like me, would absolutely love it. But if the technical synergies are real, if Tesla's chips actually power SpaceX orbital data centers running XR's models, then the combined company is worth more than the parts. JW is calling it a contrarian take because most people think SpaceX goes public traditionally in 2026. But Elon has spoke previously about a holding company structure for years. Berkshire Hathaway owns everything from insurance to furniture stores. Google restructured into Alphabet. When you got a founder with controlling stakes in multiple related businesses, combining them eventually makes sense. The question is timing. Does Elon wait until all the pieces are mature or does he move sooner to build something unprecedented? Now, check out this bonus clip. It's a clip I really enjoyed from the most recent all-in pod. >> So, here's the funniest thing is we're all in the chat group discussing the California wealth tax, whether people are going to leave or not. So, Chimath, he's making a big show. I'm going to stay and fight. I'm not leaving my home. They can't drive me out. And then meanwhile, I get a call from my broker who says she's helping Chimath find a place. >> Uhoh. WHAT'S GOING ON? >> IS CHAMOTH DOING BACK DOOR TRADE? I'm shocked that Chamath tells you one thing and is doing another. >> Oh my god. >> He's at least hedging his bets. >> He's hedging his bets. >> A lot of people are hedging their bets. A lot of people are hedging. >> Sergey is in Florida. He got a I'm sorry. Uh Larry's got a beautiful place in Florida. I see. According to the news, a lot of people and I saw Governor Abbott uh reached out to you. >> That's right. He welcomed me to Texas on X. A lot of people did. >> Michael Dell did. >> Ted Cruz. >> Ted Cruz. And yeah, it was a real welcome reception. It's funny. I never got anything like that when I was in California. >> Jason, I I put it on >> the politicians were never >> They weren't embracing you. >> Yeah, they were embracing me. I don't know why. >> Who knows? I put this on X. When you look at our friends that have all explicitly left, it's about half a trillion of net worth, which I think is very bad for the long-term budget of California. Then I can pick about 25 people just off the top of my head. And then if you think about all the people that will stay and fight, I still intend to stay and fight, but where if we're forced to look down the barrel of a an asset tax that has god knows what methodology, >> it's the only thing that's united everybody on the left and the right. Even Reed Hoffman thinks this is insane. I think a lot of other people will leave. It's probably half the total wealth that the budget estimated would be available to be taxed will be gone. Wow. I mean, these are I don't understand. That has huge implications to the social programs and the general budget of California. One of our clients started with zero audience.
