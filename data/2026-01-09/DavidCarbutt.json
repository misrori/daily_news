        "transcript": "Dan Ives just said we're entering the golden chapter for autonomous vehicles and robotics. Here come two massive Dan I clips. Check this out. >> Physical AI, it's really about autonomous robotics. I mean, this is now what I view as the consumer AI revolution starts in terms of physical AI. And I think what you saw with Nvidia, they're laying out endto-end platform on autonomous. We've talked about it's why we're so bulletin Tesla given robo taxes and the autonomous sort of vision there. But this is this is the next stage of AI but it's all fueled by the godfather of AI Jensen Nvidia. >> Dan, one of the things I heard from uh CES and Nvidia, they launched this Alpha Mayo platform. Tell us what this is because this gets a little scary for some people I think. Yeah, I mean like you could say it's reasoning or really AI meets autonomous. It's an endto-end platform that Nvidia is basically laying out as their answer for autonomous. It's really something that ultimately better than a human driver, >> right? >> And I view it as just like what Tesla's doing on robo taxis, just like what we're seeing on autonomous. Nvidia is going to be a supplier from the chip perspective, but also they're going to play an endto-end platform play as well. >> Dan, I know we we kind of knew this CES was going to be all AIcentric here. As you talk to investors, are you sensing any AI fatigue that maybe it's played out or boy, it's it's hard to handle these valuations or boy, their numbers are getting so big. What's the conversations you're having with clients about just >> I actually Yeah, Paul, I think when you you know the time we spent there with Nvidia and Jensen and on the floor, you cannot come away think that there's an AI bubble. I mean, we're still in the early days of playing out because you see what's happening on embedded devices on the chip releases. Obviously, some recent AMD and others and I think it's not fatigue. I think investors are starting to realize that this next stage of the AI revolution is now taking hold. >> Dan, help me here with this. Paul mentioned CES. Where do the smaller AI companies fit in? Are we going to like perplexity? Are we going to see M&A this year for all of these names like Claude and the rest that I don't understand? Are we going to see an AI rollup? I think you're gonna see a lot of acquisitions, strategic financial acquisitions in terms [clears throat] of tech. We talk about robotics, that's one of our favorite area names like still serve robotics is a good example. Look, the reality is is that it's an arms race that's playing out. It's going to be a lot of acquisitions, a lot of consolidation, and I think that's why >> it's just going to be year three of an 8 to 10 year build out of the AI revolution. Nvidia's Alpha Mayo, interesting name, announcement, actually validates everything Tesla has been doing for years. Dan Ies put it clearly. Physical AI is really about autonomous robotics. And when Dan talks about the competitive landscape, he keeps coming back to two companies. Nvidia for chips and infrastructure and Tesla for the actual product. So Nvidia drops this Alpha Mayo platform at CES and everyone freaks out. Oh no, Nvidia is coming for Tesla's lunch. They're building an end-to-end autonomous stack. Competition is finally coming. And yeah, I get why people reacted that way. Jensen on stage announcing a driving AI platform sounds scary if you're long Tesla like I am. But think about what actually happened. Nvidia spent years pushing lidar. They spent years saying you need radar. You need all these expensive sensors to make self-driving work. And now they show up with Alpha Mayo which is primarily vision based. They're essentially copying large amounts of Tesla's approach. Tesla committed to that approach back in 2019 when everyone said they were crazy, but Nvidia still isn't vision only like Tesla is. Sedan calls this the consumer AI revolution, shifting to physical applications, and that framing matters. We spent the last 2 years talking about chat GBT and software AI. The money has flowed to cloud compute and language models. Physical AI is different. Physical AI means robots in factories, cars driving themselves, machines operating in the real world. That's a much harder problem and a much bigger opportunity. What Nvidia is doing is smart for their business. They sell chips. They want every car company to buy their hardware and software stack. But there's a difference between selling the picks and shovels and actually mining the gold. Nvidia is the supplier. Tesla is building the mine. Sudan is bullish on the physical AI opportunity, but he's even more specific about what it means for Tesla's stock. And when he gets pushed by the skeptics and their concerns, his answer surprised me. Dian got confronted with fair criticism. Musk promises things and they usually get delivered late, or at least they often get delivered late, especially around FSD. The robo taxi fleet was supposed to be 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year. They're currently at somewhere around 50 to 80. So why should anyone trust Tesla's autonomous thesis? >> Tesla. >> Okay. So So here I have I have no I have no skin in this game. Okay. And I never have. I've I was short the stock years ago. Got my head handed to me. >> But my problem is I just don't trust Elon. I don't trust what he says. I mean, example, >> he said a couple of conference calls ago that he was going to have 500 autonomous vehicles in Austin. He's got 80. the basic business, the electronic vehicle business, that's not doing well because the credit, all the the government subsidies have gone away. That's bad. >> Robotics is on the come. >> EV, you know, electronic vehicle autonomous driving is on the come. It's all >> to me it's all hype. And and and until I actually see that the his robo taxes really work autonomously, I'm I'm on the sidelines. you tell me what you think. >> So, look and obviously like for me, you know, knowing Musk, you know, from the early days and being such a believer in tech, there were so many times where like things like they were a year and a half late. 2018, like you could argue like, you know, they were on the verge of like a bankruptcy or pseudo bankruptcy. My view is like Musk right now is is a wartime CEO. Like, what does that mean? What that basically means is that he's so laser focused almost like in a war time. But wartime being the battle versus other attacking, you know, the competition that he understands that this autonomous chapter robo taxis. It's going to be the most important chapter ever in Tesla's history. And to to your I understand the skepticism, but I believe we sit here a year from now. You're in 30 cities. The geoence area significantly expands. You're basically at level four. >> Okay. So, let me push back. Imagine that that does not happen that that a year from now within time frame that it's important, we're basically where we are today. >> What do you think then? >> Then that would be I mean that that's like a bare thesis. Like that would be one way. That's the thing. >> The stock's like a whatever sub $300 stock if that happens. I think it's 6 to800 cuz they >> because you think it it happens. It's binary. >> That's my target too. And Steve, I think the the problem here is you lay out this very elegant reasoning, which may very well be true, of why none of this stuff plays out. Yet, one problem. The chart looks great. >> Yeah. >> And it's probablyart probably the best chart of the Mac 7 uh uh at this point. So if I'm going to kind of lean on narrative or lean on price action, I'm always going to choose price action. So the price action is encouraging me to be more imaginative about what could happen over the next year or two years and whether it's 600 or 800, I'll take either. But I think the direction's higher >> just because of the way the chart looks. >> Yeah, it's it is emerging as the leader in in Max. >> And I would just add to your point like when it comes to physical AI plays in the world, they might there's Nvidia and Tesla. Those are the two best physical physical AI. But I'm saying like instead of like when you talk about just traditional AI like software use cases LM physical AI being like robotics car I'm to my physical actual AI and you look what everything like Nvidia is going after like the robotics the >> fuk in Japan that's what's I don't even know what that is >> Japanese robotics I mean you want to see a pretty chart go look at a 20-year chart of like this is the real deal >> okay >> humanoid robotics in Japan and in China is ahead of where we are in the US. >> Tesla is a binary bet where the autonomous thesis either works, i.e. robo taxis and Optimus, and if it doesn't, the stock could face a lot of pressure. Dan didn't sugarcoat it. He said if a year from now, we're basically where we are today. That would be a very bare thesis. And he thinks the stock would be sub $300. But he also said he thinks we get to $6 to $800 if Tesla can execute. I appreciate that Dan acknowledges the skeptics here. He was confronted with legitimate concerns. M said 500 robo taxis in Austin and they currently have way less than that. The EV business clearly isn't booming. You can't hide from that. And Optimus, it's still very early days. These are fair points and Dan didn't dismiss them. He just said he's betting on the other side of the trade. Dan Ives is saying Elon knows this is the most important period in Tesla's history and bar going bankrupt I definitely agree the autonomous chapter either works or it doesn't and when Musk is locked in on something historically he tends to deliver late usually yes but he delivers. SpaceX was supposed to fail. Tesla was months away maybe even weeks or days away from bankruptcy but Elon Musk somehow pulls it off. What I find compelling is that the charts agree with Dan. Tesla is arguably in place for the strongest year out of all the MAG7 right now. And there's an old saying in markets, when narrative and price action diverge, follow price action. The skeptics have logical arguments, but the stock keeps making higher highs. This usually means the market knows something the skeptics don't. Physical AI is going to be a massive theme in 2026. Dan thinks there are really only two pure plays for this. Nvidia for the infrastructure layer and Tesla for the application layer. If you believe autonomous driving is happening in the next 5 years, you probably want to follow both closely. But Tesla is the one that actually deploys cars on the roads right now. Nvidia is selling the tools. Tesla is building the infrastructure. If I could recommend one place to start learning AI, it would be the course I put together. It's clear, structured, and designed for beginners who want to get genuinely knowledgeable on AI. You'll get lifetime access to all lessons, including future modules. We're thinking about adding a new module soon. And just a heads up, the price rises as more modules are added. So, it's currently at the lowest price you'll see now.
