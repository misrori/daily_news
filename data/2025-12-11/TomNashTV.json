        "transcript": "This is a critical warning to every single investor out there. I don't want you to click nothing, smash nothing, or buy nothing. Just listen. What I'm about to say today, what I'm about to show you and explain to you might actually save your portfolio from a world of trouble. So, you certainly don't want to miss out on this video. Please listen to everything I have to say today. This is super important. Now, right now, there are two groups of investors. On the one hand, we got people saying, \"Well, you know, we had such a beautiful year. We've done 15% on the S&P 500. It's well above average. The last three years were wonderful. The market is so expensive. It's bound not to give us the so-called Santa rally and instead of it give us a lump of coal. So, let's get out before that happens. And that's fine. That's a good strategy. And if you don't do it and the market collapses, you're going to feel horrible. On the other hand, there's this second subset of investors who hold the opposite position saying, well, you know, this is all nice and dandy. The market is in this beautiful kind of upward momentum. The bull run has been going on for a while, but the Santa rally is set up in such a way that it would be silly not to partake because if you sit on the sideline and the market ends up doing another 10% in two weeks, which is the annual return on the S&P 500 in a normal year, well, that would be a darn shame and that would be kind of annoying. So, let's stay in the market and write it out. Now, these two groups basically reflect the decision that every investor has to make right now as we go into the end of the year. This is basically the dilemma. Investors are paralyzed because they don't know what to do. If they sit on the sideline, miss out, it's going to be horrible. If they stay in and the market collapses, well, that's going to be horrible as well. So, what do we do? What do we do? Don't worry, I got you in this video. In this video, I'm going to give you a clear answer what I think is going to happen. Of course, ain't financial advice, just my opinion. And I'll share with you my scenario, my thought process, and my prediction as to what happens over the next few weeks. But just to clarify, the market is a very wild beast. And maybe everything I just said right now doesn't materialize. The market can stay rash and crazy longer than any of us can stay solvent. So take it with a little bit of a salt, with a grain of salt. But nevertheless, this is what I think. So, I think that we will get an initial drop over the next couple of days heading into the final couple of weeks of this year. I believe there is one more shakeoff event that's about to play out. I don't know how big it's going to be, but if I had to guess, probably two to 3% drop on the S&P 500, maybe 4%. Something that scares people enough to sell out and to think that the rally isn't coming. I think that plays out over the next three, four, five, six, seven days, whatever that case may be. I don't know exactly when, but once they clear out all the weak hands from the market, the rally is actually going to start and the last 10 14 days of the year are going to be an absolute roller coaster into the huge stratosphere, if you want to put it this way. But it's going to be very, very pleasant to be in the market for this Santa rally, which I think is happening. And here's why I think it's going to play out this way. Number one, we are at a stretched positioning a little bit on the short term. If you look at the S&P 500, we have done about 17% year-to- date, but the majority of what we've done this year, we have done over the past 6 months, not the past 12 months. So, the past 6 months have basically been a major spike pretty much since April, we've been on a tear, right? Past six months is up 14% out of the 17 that we got year to date. So, which means that we're heading super hot into this center rally and which means we will have to have a cooling down period before this spike is going to happen. That's normal. That's part of the game. I just don't want people to think that this is the reversal that everybody's afraid of. It's just profit taking some tax loss harvesting where it's available. These endofear pullbacks inside the bull run is pretty normal. And as you zoom out, you kind of almost don't even see them or feel them. But at the moment, like a 3% drop on the S&P 500 over the course of, let's say, a week is going to feel very much real. So, I just want you to be at ease with yourself and relax. Relax. This is a normal pullback. Now, the second thing is if you look at the fear and greed index right now, we still have that wall of worry very much intact. Right now we are at max fear with 36 on the fear and greed index. That is insanely bearish. The market is holding the opinion that this is not a good setup. Right now we're in full fear mode, not in full euphoria mode. So that actually may contribute to a shortterm pullback. When the market is fidgety, when the market is nervous, when retail is basically kind of in fear mode, every little jitter might actually accelerate that pullback, that correction that is designed, and by the way, it ain't something new. You should know this by now. It is designed by the institutional players to shake out the weak hands from retail and get them to leave the market so they can improve their cost basis upon that dip. It's not the first time they've done it. It's not the last time. You just have to know the rules of the game. On top of this, we have the Fed cutting the rates as was expected. But here's the thing in the stock market is for traders. You have to understand that for these guys, it's by the rumors still the news. So every time you have a positive event for the stock market that is completely priced in ahead of time, when the event actually plays out as expected, there is a pullback, there is a correction because there is profit taking and the traders essentially selling the news. Now that on top of as I said tax loss harvesting, end of year planning, a lot of different things that happen in the market normally towards the end of the year might actually bring out the correction. That correction is going to cost people a lot of money. People who don't have long-term investing mindset, people who are not really understanding what they are in the market. Sometimes they're long-term, sometimes they're traders, they can't make up their mind. And this is a sort of shakeoff that's going to be very detrimental to their investing journey. What I think happens after the shakeoff towards the last 10 14 days of the year is that we will certainly go up and the rally might be 5%, might be 10%, maybe even 15%, I don't know, but it's going to be a pretty hefty rally because we will have more liquidity right now in the market because the Fed just opened the floodgates again with the rate cut and with the beginning of quantitative easing. [snorts] On top of it, historically speaking, the last two weeks of December are one of the strongest period in the market. And right now, we have no reason to think that it should be any different because there is nothing in the setup that says, \"Hey, this December is a little bit different. Maybe it's macro, maybe geopolitics as it stands right now. We are on a normal year, which means that historically speaking, December should be very strong. On top of this, the flip side of having this wall of worry, that 36 fear and greed score is that when it actually starts to crack the flat gates open, and I think that's what we're going to see is that this wall of worry collapse and all the water is going to pour out. On top of this, as I mentioned before, and it's not me bringing out this idea. It's Tom Lee's thesis, and I do agree with it, is that we have a lot of fund managers who are dying to jump into this market and improve their performance towards the end of the year. So, it doesn't look as bad as it is. And if we have a little pullback of 5%, 3%, 4%, they're going to pile into the market trying to get ahead of this rally, which is going to essentially cause the rally to happen. It's a little bit weird to think about it. It's a self-fulfilling cycle. And on this topic, this Sunday, I'm about to have one of the most important lectures I've ever given for my academy members. I have 25,000 members in my academy, pat.com/dommnash. We will have a full 2026 prediction, roadmap, game plan, strategy, all my thoughts about what's going to happen 2026, what my strategy is going to be, and let me just give you a hint. I think 2026 is going to be extremely abnormal. I know you're nervous about the next couple of weeks on the stock market, but looking at it from a perspective of somebody who has been around some of the world's best investors, I can tell you right now, they are not nervous. None of them is. None of them is panicking. None of them is nervous. You know why? Because what they do essentially, they work based on a system. Every single rich investor I've seen, every single top 1% performer I've seen works on a sacred system which no matter what the circumstances are, they do not digress from that system. And they work that system. Doesn't matter what the macroeconomy is, what the stock market says, what the headlines, they work their system. And that system is generating insane amounts of profits for these guys. None of this happens overnight. I know it seems like in the films there's a sudden event, somebody just made a lot of money overnight. None of the people that I've made, at least have made their money overnight. It was a slow burn process. It was a marathon. And they mainly understand that for them to slow down the compounding effect on their money, it has to be something cataclysmic. As you look at this investing world, the number one lesson that I've learned from rich people is that they understand the importance of compounding. The minute you take your money off the market, number one, there's this famous number with the top 10 days. Missing the top 10 days over the past 20 years would have cost you 50% performance. Just 10 days in 20 years, right? But that put aside just losing the compounding effect is insane. So, for them to take out their money, it has to be aliens landing, taking over. It doesn't happen. Okay? I'll show you an example. If you put in $50,000 in the stock market right now, and you keep adding another $1,000 every month, you'll have $320,000 within 10 years. Every six years, if you just sit in the S&P 500, you're going to double your money. I mean, that's pretty much what happened over the past 100 years. These guys understand the insane cheat code that is compounding. So they don't pull out their money every time they think a pullback is coming. None of them does this. In fact, when COVID came in 2020 and the market dropped 30% and everybody was convinced that the world is ending that this is it, Vanguard actually showed that from the 1 million and above portfolios, 99% of them have not sold. 99%. The only ones who sold out and ran around like headless chickens were retail investors. But the main thing I want to show you here is like on average, and that's based on Vanguard research, the average holding period of a stock by a top 1 million portfolio and above is 12 years. So on average, rich people, successful investors hold a stock for 12 years on average. Understand that before you start to analyze what the next two weeks are looking like. None of these rich people I worked with for the past 20 years is stressing about what the Fed is going to say, what the rate cut is going to look like, what the next two weeks are going to look like. Okay, we have a plan for the next two weeks, 3 weeks, whatever it may be, which is stay in the market. If a pullback comes, realize it's temporary. DCA double down, improve your cost average, and write out the rally. And if the rally doesn't come, well, then you just keep on buying and keep on investing until the correction actually stops. And at that point, you enjoy the ride back up. Whether it happens in the next two weeks, in the next four weeks, in the next two months, it doesn't really matter. Okay. Now, again, as I mentioned, 2026 is going to be insane. 2026 is not going to be like any year we've seen over the past three or four decades. It's going to be an absolute abnormal phenomena. If you actually want to understand what I'm talking about and go beyond, well, you know, the market is stretched, the P ratios are high, we're due for a crash. That talk is for headlines on Google for free articles. If you want to understand what actually is going to happen 2026 based on what I'm seeing in front of me right now, join the Patreon, join the academy. patreon.com/dommnash. Would love to see you there. It's not for traders. It's not for people with short-term mindset. It's not for impatient people. If you're a long-term investor, I invite you to join the academy. join the lecture and I'll see you"
