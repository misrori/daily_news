        "transcript": "So, what do you need, Frank? A gazillion dollars in unmarked Bitcoin? I don't have a price. >> Not sure what he meant by unmarked, but all Bitcoins are traceable. Here's why. When you send a Bitcoin to your friend, that transaction and its details are permanently carved into Bitcoin's blockchain, which by the way is public. And because all transactions are chained, anyone can trace where a Bitcoin has been and check its full transaction history. It's like printing every transaction directly onto a dollar bill each time it gets used."
