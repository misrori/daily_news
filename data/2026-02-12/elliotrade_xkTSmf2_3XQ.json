No,  no,  no.  We   are  live.  And  oh  yes,  it's  another   bloody  day  in  the  markets.   But  to  be  honest,  I  think  we  all  knew   this  was  coming.  At  least  on  this   channel,  we've  been  giving  you  the  the   hard  and  fast,  the  honest  truth  for   quite  a  while  now,  which  is  that  when  we   lost  that  100k  range,  when  we  cascaded   down  to  the  80s,  it  was  pretty  obvious   that  it  was  time  to  play  defense.  And   so,  we  obviously  made  the  housekeeping,   you  know,  video,  we  took  some  profits  up   in  the  '90s  if  you  did  that.  And  if  you   didn't,  we're  going  to  be  navigating   this  next  section  together  because  we   are  here  not  trying  to  be  dogmatic,  not   trying  to  cling  on  to  anything  that   happened  in  the  past.  We're  here  with   one  mission  and  one  mission  only,  which   is  to  make  the  absolute  most  amount  of   money  over  the  next  few  months  and   years.  Because  as  much  as  this  is   annoying,  as  much  as  this  is  one  of  the   most  painful  times  that  most  of  us  have   experienced  in  crypto,  the  truth  is  that   in  2026,  the  chessboard  is  moving   extremely  fast.  It  is  one  of  the  most   exciting  moments  in  history.   And  for  that  reason,  I  think  we  are  all   very  very  lucky.  We  are  all  very  very   lucky.  And  I'm  going  to  tell  you  quite   honestly,  I  believe  that  this  will  be   one  of  the  most  important  and  also   easiest  times  to  make  a  huge  amount  of   money  in  history.  And  it's  not  going  to   be  the  simple  buy  altcoins  and  Bitcoin   and  wait  for  the  four-year  cycle.  We're   going  to  be  far  more  actionable.  We're   going  to  be  far  more  specific.  And  we're   going  to  be  far  more  evidence-based,   fact-based,  and  all  of  this  will  be  in   our  control.  Yes,  we  will  make  a  ton  of   money  in  crypto  by  buying  the  bottom  and   by  riding  up  the  next  cycle.  And  if  you   are  an  active  trader,  we  will  make  a  ton   of  money  when  there  are  short   opportunities.  However,  if  you  are  not   an  active  trader  and  you  are  looking  for   something  more  exciting  than  just   waiting  for  the  next  cycle,  then  I   promise  you  that  we  will  be  bringing  you   some  absolute  fire  over  the  next  weeks   and  months.  Because  I  have  been  working,   no  doubt,  the  most  I've  ever  worked  in   my  life.  And  it  feels  like  fun.  Even   though  I  got  absolutely  wrecked  last   year,  even  though  financially  I   definitely  would  have  been  better  off  if   I  had  sold  X  in  December  of  2024  or   whatever,  that's  all  the  past.  I  can   tell  you  that  I  am  so  enthusiastic  about   what's  happening  right  now  in  the  world.   And  it's  almost  been  maybe  eight  years   since  I  felt  this  way.  It  reminds  me  of   when  I  first  found  crypto.  It  reminds  me   of  the  good  old  days.  Let  me  show  you   something.  Let  me  show  you  something.   Okay,  you're  looking  at  my  new   dashboard.  I'm  making  this  dashboard  and   I'm  not  going  to  it's  not  public.  It's   not  for  other  people  yet.  It's  just  for   me  right  now.  But  I'm  making  a  dashboard   where  I  have  everything  that  I  need  to   analyze  markets,  make  trades,  make   content,  everything  I  need  to  do  in  one   place.  And  I'm  going to  give  it  to  you.   This  is  a  very  easy  way  to  see  this,   okay?  Everything  is  down  today.   Everything  is  bloody  today.  And  I  told   you  guys  this  a  few  episodes  ago.  What's   happening  to  crypto  is  a  canary  in  the   coal  mine  of  what's  happening  across  the   economy.  Why  is  crypto  crashing?  Well,   crypto's  crashing  because  Bitcoin's   crashing  and  Bitcoin's  crashing  because   everything's  crashing.  The  question  is   why  is  everything  crashing?  And  we've   been  trying  to  get  to  the  borderline,   the  baseline  truth  of  what  is  happening   there  for  quite  some  time.  And  I  think   one  of  the  key  realizations  here  is  that   liquidity  itself  is  not  growing.  This  is   the  number  one  thing  that  we've  all  been   looking  forward  to  is  when  are  we  going   to  get  more  liquidity,  right?  And  what  I   think  we  should  all  be  looking  at  right   now  is  the  S&P  500  because  the  S&P  500   is  showing  a  pretty  obvious  what  they   call  bearish  divergence.  Okay?  And  this   is  not  a  highly  technical  thing  to   understand.  This  is  a  very  simple  thing   to  understand.  Just  look  at  the  bottom   of  the  screen  and  you'll  see  uh  a   decreasing  strength.  This  is  the  RSI.   You  can  see  that  in  these  orange  bars,   you  had  a  slightly  increasing  uh  price   for  the  S&P  and  a  decreasing  strength   for  the  S&P.  And  in  this  time,  you  call   this  a  divergence,  right?  It's  not  super   hard.  It's  a  simple  concept.  They  can   take  a  long  time  before  they  actually   play  out,  which  is  why  they're  not  super   actionable.  You  can  see  that  this  one   started  in  December  of  uh  2024  and  it   took  until  February  for  it  to  actually   break  down.  We  can  see  that  we  have   something  kind  of  similar  happening  and   it  started  all  the  way  back  in  October   of  last  year.  But  we  know  October  wasn't   a  good  month.  Wasn't  a  good  month  for   anything.  And  even  though  the  main   indexes,  these  indices  of  the  S&P  500   have  recovered.  The  truth  is  that  we   have  had  this  massive  falloff  in   strength.  Right?  So  this  is  what's   happening  not  just  in  crypto.  This  is   what's  happening  across  the  entire   economy  right  now  is  that  there  is  a   lack  of  strength.  And  I  believe  that   what  we  are  looking  at  is  probably  a   precursor  to  a  leg  downward  in  the  S&P.   Now,  this  yellow  line,  it  doesn't  mean   anything.  I'm  just  saying  down,  right?  I   don't  care.  It  might  go  down.  It  might   just  tag  this  prior  low  of  6,500,  which   is  really  not  a  big  that's  not  a  big   discount  at  all.  From  the  highs  here,   you're  talking  about  what  is  that  7%.   That's  not  even  remotely  uh  a  a  down   market.  That's  not  that's  a  that's  a   slight  pain.  That's  a  twitch.  If  you're   in  crypto,  that's  literally  not  even   pulling  your  hamstring.  That's  not  even   a  day  off  from  the  gym  in  crypto.  You're   training  right  through  that.  You're   pushing  right  through.  You're  doing  set   three.  you're  doing  set  set  four.  Okay,   that  doesn't  even  hurt  you  if  you're  in   crypto  7%.  Okay,  but  what  might  hurt,   what  might  be  a  bit  of  a  sting  is  if   this  doesn't  hold  and  we  go  lower.  And   so  you  have  a  few  other  sort  of  little   levels  that  have  emerged  here.  And   again,  these  are  not  meant  to  be  hard   and  fast.  We  have  this  prior  high  around   6100.  We  have  this  little  low  here,  but   it  doesn't  matter.  It  ends  when  it  ends.   It  goes  down  to  where  it  goes  down  to  if   it  goes  down.  These  things  tend  to  take   a  while  before  they  actually  dump.  But   when  they  do  dump,  it  opens  up  massive   opportunities  because  almost  always  or   let  me  be  very  clear,  always  since   forever  the  market  rallies  after  it   dumps.  So  unless  this  time  is  different,   and  I  don't  believe  it  is,  I  don't   believe  this  time  is  ever  really   different,  right?  Uh  we  will  find  that   we  have  amazing  buying  opportunities   here  in  the  year  after  the  year  after   the  having  aka  the  midterm  year,  which   is  the  cyclical  bare  market  year  for   crypto.  Now,  I'm  not  a  big  fan  of  this   cyclical  stuff.  I'm  going  to  be  honest.   The  cyclical  stuff  is  boring  for  someone   who  spends  all  day  every  day  in  the   charts,  in  the  news  trying  to  figure  out   why  or  how  to  get  ahead  of  the  market.   And  maybe  it's  as  simple  as  just  letting   the  market  do  its  thing.  Maybe  that's   what  Bitcoin  is.  It's  a  four-year  timer   and  it  just  reacts  to  liquidity  flows.   Maybe.  Maybe.  I  do  believe  though  that   we  will  see  at  least  buying   opportunities  starting  to  come  into  the   picture  when  that  4-year  cycle  typically   bottoms.  I'm  not  a  big  believer  that  you   can  just  set  a  timer  and  forget  it   because  there's  too  many  people  now   after  the  uh  October  high  that  will  be   looking  to  just  buy  in  October  of  the   next  year.  But  that's  something  to  have   on  your  calendar.  You  know,  if  if  if  the   calendar  if  the  astrology  the  the  male   astrology  if  the  if  the  instead  of   asking  your  girl  her  birth  sign,  you  ask   her,  \"Hey,  did  you  buy  the  bottom  of  the   four-year  cycle,  baby?\"  Um  that's  what   we're  going  to  be  doing  together.  And  uh   we're  going  to  be  trying  to  find  the   best  deals  and  we're  going  to  be  trying   to  make  a  lot  of  money  in  between  that   time  because  we  want  to  make  obviously   everyone  here  wants  to  buy  in  bulk  the   lows  of  Bitcoin  and  sell  out  the  highs   and  that's  what  we're  going  to  try  to   do.  So  with  that  in  mind,  I  think  this   is  the  big  thing  that's  happening  is  the   S&P  is  obviously  obviously  rolling,   right?  You  can  see  these  obvious  sort  of   shapes  to  the  chart.  And  when  you  look   at  obvious  shapes,  who  knows  exactly   does  this  break  down  now?  Does  this  keep   going  for  a  few  months?  I  don't  have  a   crystal  ball,  but  this  is  what's  showing   on  the  chart,  and  you're  starting  to  see   some  pretty  significant  weakness  here.   Now,  that  said,  uh  when  you  look  at  uh   my  dashboard  view  here,  uh  and  by  the   way,  we're  going  to  talk  a  little  bit   about  uh  AI  in  this  video.  If  you're  not   following  the  trends  with  AI,  I  highly   suggest  you  do  if  at  the  very  least,   just  so  you  understand  how  amazing  these   tools  have  gotten,  uh  scary,  but  it's   amazing.  For  example,  I  coded  this  and  I   iterated  on  it  in  like  one  night.  Like   one  night.  It  was  actually  insane.  Uh   but  I  just  wanted  to  show  you  this  sort   of  dashboard  view  where  you  can  see  all   of  the  the  assets  we're  tracking  here   are  just  absolutely  uh  blood  red.  Okay.   And  so  one  of  the  things  that  I  think   has  been  under  reportported  and  under   discussed,  I  agree  with  this  TXMC  tweet.   Michael  Howell,  he's  like  the  godfather.   He's  the  godfather  of  global  liquidity   theory.  And  everyone  and  their  mama  has   been  saying  liquidity  is  about  to  surge   in  2026  because  Trump's  going  to   stimulate  because  Trump's  going  to  drop   interest  rates.  The  new  Fed  share  is   going  to  just  pump  pump  it  up.  We  know   that  Trump  is  going  to  come  with  a   liquidity  bazooka.  That  has  been  the   narrative.  That  has  been  my  narrative   because  that's  as  much  as  I  understood   it  was  the  case.  But  Michael  Howell  is   the  actual  godfather  of  global  liquidity   as  an  actual  useful  macroeconomic   metric.  and  he's  actually  emphasizing   that  the  US  liquidity  cycle  has  peaked   has  peaked  already.  Now  a  lot  of  us  will   be  looking  at  this  entire  liquidity   cycle  and  say  how  can  that  be?  We  didn't   even  get  a  liquidity  cycle  liquidity  has   been  drained  from  the  economy  just   systematically  for  the  last  four  years.   How  do  we  get  a  peak  in  US  liquidity?   How  is  that  even  possible?  And  what  I   want  to  put  on  your  radar  is  that  it   could  be  possible.  Right?  We  do  not  know   what  Kevin  Walsh  will  do  when  he's  in   the  Fed.  We  do  not  know  if  there  will  be   stimulus.  We  do  not  know.  So,  what  I   want  to  do  here  on  this  channel  going   forward  is  be  a  truth  seeker.  That's  all   I'm  trying  to  do  is  seek  the  truth.  It's   not  about  seeking  the  truth  that  we  want   to  be  true.  It's  about  seeking  the  truth   that  is.  And  in  this  case,  we're  trying   to  figure  out  has  this  happened?  Has   liquidity  peaked?  Because  if  it  has,   then  an  asset  that's  reflexive  and   responsive  to  liquidity,  Bitcoin  should   be  going  down.  That's  doing  what  it's   supposed  to  do.  Think  about  it  that  way.   If  you  want  liquidity  or  if  you  want   Bitcoin  to  go  up  to  a  million  dollars   because  they're  printing  money,  then  you   also  need  it  to  go  down  when  they're   removing  money  from  the  system  or  when   liquidity  starts  contracting.  That  is   the  double-edged  sword.  You  don't  get   the  pumpity  pumps  without  the  dumpity   dumps.  That  is  just  the  game.  Now,  if   Michael  How  is  right,  and  believe  me,   he's  got  a  lot  more  experience  in   predicting  things  these  things  than  I   do,  um,  I  encourage  you,  I'm  not  going   to  go  through  his  whole  research  here,   but  this  is  very  interesting  that  he  is   claiming  that  the  liquidity  cycle  may   have  peaked  because  if  that  is  the  case,   then  that  would  indicate  that  the  S&P,   which  by  the  way  also  is  just  a  gauge  of   liquidity,  right?  Like  this  is  only   going  up  because  there's  more  and  more   and  more  money  in  the  world.  these  uh   valuations  in  the  S&P  keep  growing  in   relation  to  GDP,  in  relation  to  the   underlying  profits  because  there's  just   more  money  in  the  world,  right?  So,  this   is  a  liquidity  sensitive  asset,  the  S&P,   so  is  Bitcoin.  And  as  we  uh  discussed  on   the  last  episode,  we  are  finally   starting  to  see  a  re  reaceleration  here   in  the  ISM,  which  was  another  indicator   of  an  economy  that  is  recovering.  So   just  because  liquidity  is  contracting   doesn't  mean  that  the  economy  is   contracting.  And  this  is  where  we  get   into  the  weeds  of  why  macro  can  be  so   difficult  and  why  our  new  system  is   going  to  be  what  keeps  us  safe.  Because   the  new  system  might  overweight  this   pump  in  the  ISM  and  say,  you  know what,   ISM  or  the  old  system  might  have   overweighted  the  pump  in  the  ISM  that   we've  been  waiting  for  for  literally   four  years  and  say,  okay,  well,  now  it's   time.  Now  it's  go  time.  Now  it's  time  to   buy  crypto.  And  it  might  be  the  case   that  right  now  is  the  bottom.  But  we   don't  have  to  guess.  We  do  not  have  to   guess  because  the  new  system  will  take   all  of  these  things  into  account  and  we   can  get  a  narrative  or  fundamental  view   of  the  market.  And  then  we  can  trade   purely  purely  based  on  prices  when  they   uh  agree  with  that  fundamental  view.   Because  price,  I'm  telling  you,  if  we're   going  to  go  to  the  Bitcoin  chart,  price   doesn't  seem  like  it's  been  responding   to  any  kind  of  pump.  This  to  me  looks   like  a  down  arrow.  I  mean,  you  don't   have  to  be  a  rocket  science  scientist.   You  don't  have  to  be  super  biased  about   this  to  say  this  chart  seems  to  be  going   in  one  direction.  Now,  will  this  be  the   bottom  and  it  springs?  Maybe.  Maybe.  I   hope  it  is.  Believe  me,  I  hope  it  is.   But  is  there  any  evidence  of  that  yet?   And  the  answer  to  that  is  not  yet.  And   so  we  will  take  into  account  all  of   these  bullish  factors,  but  we  will  trade   based  on  the  triggers  from  the  chart.   And  the  first  major  trigger  that  we  want   to  see  is  getting  above  this  level  right   here.  It's  not  very  complicated  and  it's   not  very  far  away.  And  then  we  can  start   analyzing  what  is  the  plan  from  there.   So  first  of  all,  let  me  get  this  uh  this   sloppy  circle  out  of  the  way.  this   little  peak  above  72K.  We  started   talking  about  this  all  the  way  as  we   cascaded  down  here,  which  is  that  until   we  reclaim  the  72K  and  more  importantly   when  we  first  fell  through  that  7274K   range,  that  was  a  very  bearish  sign,   right?  Because  that  was  a  huge  huge   level  on  the  chart  that  we  talked  about.   So,  this  is  the  first  big  boss,  right?   That's  how  the  charts  work.  there's  big   bosses.  And  often  times  what  I've  seen   is  that  these  wicks,  these  kind  of  uh   freaky  little  thin  wicks  can  tend  to  be   very  important  levels.  If  you  see  here   back  on  Sunday,  we  had  a  little  pop  up   above  72  and  it  immediately  reverted   down.  You  see,  it  just  had  this  baby   little  wick.  It  didn't  even  close  a  one   or  I  think  it  closed  one  one  minute   candle  above  72K  and  it  was  allergic  to   it.  It  was  literally  like  if  you  have   that  friend  with  a  peanut  allergy  where   someone  breathes  like  they  have  a  peanut   uh  flavored  cologne  and  they  breathe  in   the  other  room  and  all  of  a  sudden  they   explode  with  hives.  That's  what  happened   when  Bitcoin  hit  72K.  It  was  allergic  to   it.  Okay.  So  the  easy  way  to  to  think   here  is  while  Bitcoin  fails  to  get  above   this  level,  I  would  assume  that  we  are   probably  going  to  test  lower.  And  and  if   you  look  at  just  the  shape  of  the  chart,   it  has  this  kind  of  like  arcing  shape.   It's  pretty  clear  that  there's  not  been   any  real  pumps.  Uh,  look  at  this.  Each   15minute  candle  closes  slightly  lower   than  the  one  before.  Each  little  peak  of   the  15-minute  chart.  And  you  can  see  it   barely  barely  went  up  here  and   immediately  slammed.  I  mean,  look  at   this.  The  one  time  the  one  time  that   Bitcoin  actually  did  get  above  its  prior   15minute  high  right  here,  which  which  is   in  the  circle,  it  immediately  went  down.   What  was  this?  5%.  Yeah,  four  or  five%.   just  to  give  you  a  sense  of  how  allergic   Bitcoin  is  to  going  up  right  now  and  how   much  people  are  trying  to  get  out  of   Bitcoin  or  some  seller  is  trying  to  get   out  of  Bitcoin.  So,  that's  just  the  the   the  current  status.  Now,  could  this  be   the  bottom?  I  certainly  hope  it  is.  Um   my  good  buddy  Will,  not  good  buddy,  but   my  uh  person  I  like  here.  I  I  want  to   just  in  in  in  light  of  all  the  recent   documents  have  come  to  come  to  light,   you  never  want  to  say  anyone's  your  good   buddy  and  unless  you  really  have  a  close   relationship.  But  another  crypto   commentator  who  I  think  is  very  smart.   I'll  put  it  that  way.  Crypto  commentator   I  think  is  very  smart.  Uh  this  guy  Will   um  I  think  I  call  too  many  people  buddy   pal  guy.  Uh  he  said  this.   Um  where  was  this?  I  lost  this  tweet.  Ah   throughout  Bitcoin's  lifespan  we  have   seen  two  indicators  continue  to  be  the   best  global  market  bottom  signals.  The   mayor  multiple  distance  from  200E  moving   average  and  the  200E  moving  average  or   200  day  moving  average  and  the  200WE   moving  average.  And  you  can  see  here  he   has  them  shown  here.  Um,  and  you  can  see   that  we  have  the  mayor  multiple  is   apparently  firing  off  here.  I  actually   don't  know  how  the  mayor  multiple  is   calculated.  If  you  do,  go  ahead  and   comment  in  the  comment  section.  And  then   we  have  the  200  day  moving  average,   which  I  believe  uh  is  somewhere   somewhere  up.  Um,  actually,  we  don't   have  to  believe.  Let's  go  ahead  and   look.  Let's  go  ahead  and  look  where  the   200  day  moving  average  is.  Uh,  SMA  200.   And  we  get  ourselves  101K.  So,  we  are   currently  down   about   36%   from  the  200  day  moving  average.  Roughly   35%.  That's  pretty  significant.  Um,  and   obviously  what  will  saying  here  is  that,   you  know,  this  is  this  is  not  normal,   right?  This  typically  would  be   indicative  of  being  near  a  bottom.  And   in  normal  times,  I  would  say  yes,  this   is  probably  indicative  of  being  near  a   bottom.  Again,  if  you  want  to  go  based   on  onchain  metrics  and  that's  the  system   you  want  to  use  to  trade  long-term,  I   have  no  doubt  that  Bitcoin  will  trade   much  higher  than  where  we  are  now.   Depends  on  where  you're  at  and  what  type   of  moves  you're  trying  to  make.  I'm   trying  to  be  much  more  directional.  I'm   trying  to  get  direction  right.  I'm   trying  to  get  trend  right.  That's  what   I'm  trying  to  get  right.  And  right  now,   the  number  one  metric  I'm  looking  at  is   price.  And  so  until  I  see  buyers   stepping  in  significantly,   I'm  not  convinced  yet  that  we've  seen  a   bottom.  And  I  want  to  be  very  clear.  I'm   not  going  to  time  the  bottom.  That's  not   what  I'm  trying  to  do.  I  do  want  to  time   the  reversal  from  the  bottom  and  ride   that  trend.  That's  my  goal.  Once  a   bottom  has  been  established,  I  want  to   see  the  breakout  above  that  range  and   say,  \"Okay,  looks  like  Bitcoin  has   finally  been  accumulated  and  it's  ready   for  its  next  cycle.\"  And  in  the   meantime,  I'm  going  to  be  looking  for   more  uh  liquidity  sensitive  trades   because  there's  a  lot  of  stuff  I  want  to   invest  into  this  year.  And  it's  not  only   Bitcoin.  And  I'm  going  to  be  telling  you   this  because  I  think  this  year  is  going   to  be  one  of  the  most  important  times   ever  in  investment  history.  And  I  will   be  giving  you  that  information  in  just  a   minute.  I  actually  will  be  giving  not   just  one,  two,  but  an  entire  new  series   of  content.  I'm  actually  debating   opening  an  entire  second  channel  for   this  because  I'm  become  so  passionate   about  some  of  the  opportunities  coming   into  the  world  today.  That  to  me,  one  of   the  things  that  I'm  so  excited  about  is   I'm  very  confident  that  they  will   deliver  what  is  being  advertised  on  the   tin.  And  that's  been  one  of the  things   that  I've  been  so  upset  with  crypto  is   that  it  hasn't  always  delivered.  In   fact,  it's  rarely  delivered  what  it  said   it  was  going  to  do.  And  that's  where  I   believe  we  can  speculate  on  crypto  long   term,  but  we  can  also  speculate  on   things  that  are  having  real  world  impact   today.  Uh,  and  one  of  those  things  in  my   opinion  is  AI.  Uh,  and  the  other  thing   that  hasn't  been  priced  in  is  robotics.   And  that's  going  to  be  where  I'm  going   to  be  focusing  most  of  my  time  this   year.  I'm  going  to  be  telling  you  a  lot   more  about  it.  Um,  and  I  just  I  just   really  think  that  uh  what's  happening  is   is  spectacular.  I  was  able  to  vibe  code   this  uh  this  entire  portal  with  all   kinds  of  trade  setups  um  with,  you  know,   hooks,  ideas,  scripts,  uh  narratives  to   track.  This  one's  pretty  cool.  You  can   see  all  these  different  narratives.  Uh   nuclear,  uh  gold  squeeze,  Bitcoin  ETFs.   There's  just  a  ton  of  information  that   I've  been  able  to  amalgamate,  which  I   usually  go  to  all  these  different  sites.   Uh  instead  of  being  on  Twitter,  I  can   now  have  Twitter  sort  of  in  this  in  this   hub.  I'm  gonna  be  building  the  tools   that  make  me  better  each  and  every  day.   And  I  really  I  really  hope  you  all  hop   on  this  train,  too,  because  it's  just   incredible  what's  happening.  It's  not   the  point  of  today.  But  also,  I  want  to   be  clear,  maybe  this  is  the  bottom,   right?  Bitcoin  versus  silver,  XAU,   right?  Or  is  that  gold?  Is  XAU  gold  or   silver?  Well,  anyway,  I  think  it's  gold.   But  anyway,  Bitcoin  versus  gold.  Uh   Blunt's  here,  one  of  the  best  chartists   here  on  Twitter.  He's  saying  this  is  the   completion  of  the  whatever  wave.  He's  an   Elliot  wave  guy.  Maybe  this  is  the   bottom.  Maybe  it  is.  Let's  find  out.  Uh,   in  the  end,  I  don't  think  you  need  to  be   uh  using  any  system  you  don't  want  to   use.  But  my  system  that  I  want  to   confirm  things  is  price.  The  reason  why   I'm  doing  that  is  because  if  I  had  used   a  very  simplified  price  sensitive  weekly   support  and  resistance  system,  I  would   have  sold  very  near  the  top  and  I  would   have  ridden  every  single  trend  both  up   and  down  throughout  the  last  cycle.  And   we're  going  to  do  that  this  time  because   crypto  is  a  great  place  to  trade.  It's   an  incredible  place  to  trade.  If  you   have  high  confidence  in  directional   moves,  you  can  make  so  much  money,  it'll   make  your  head  spin.  And  that's  what   we're  going  to  be  doing.  And  in  fact,  I   did  make  a  good  amount  of  money  shorting   last  uh  last  during  that  collapse.  And  I   want  to  get  to  the  point  where  I'm   confident  enough  sharing  those  setups.   Now,  one  of  the  other  things  I  want  to   share  is  that  despite  what  everything's   going  through,  the  CIA  has  discovered   that  being  optimistic  can  literally   improve  the  odds  uh  while  trading.  In   199  uh  1989,  the  CIA  literally  approved   uh  literally  approved  that  approaching   the  markets  with  intention  produces   different  results.  Um  I  don't  think   that's  uh  I  think  they  meant  proved,  but   anyway,  the  point  is  if  you  think   positive  thoughts,  you  think  positive   thoughts,  you'll  have  more  positive   outcomes.  That's  just  the  way  it  works.   Okay.  Um  now,  there's  going  to  be  some   noise  this  week  around  uh  the  inflation   print,  uh  the  CPI.  I  think  it's  a   nothing  burger  because  we  have  true   inflation  here  and  true  inflation  is   showing  that  we  have  sub  1%  real   inflation.  There's  no  real  inflation   happening  right  now  and  if  liquidity  is   actually  peaking  I  highly  doubt  we'll   see  an  uptick  in  inflation  uh  very   significantly  again  uh  nowhere  near.  But   I  did  want  to  point  this  out  because   I've  been  thinking  a  lot  sometimes  the   bare  market  can  clear  your  head.  It  can   take  away  the  speculative  excitement.  It   takes  away  your  bias.  You  kind  of  just   get  rendered  as  truthful  as  you  can  be.   One  of  the  things  that  we've  seen   throughout  this,  let's  just  say  the   document  release.  I'm  sure  you  all  have   been  tracking  this,  but  there  was  huge   interference  on  Bitcoin  being  used  in   the  early  days  as  cash.  Um,  and  this  was   a  huge  debate  if  you  were  here  in  2017.   Bitcoin,  there  was  an  entire  war  over   whether  it  should  have  big  blocks  or   small  blocks,  whether  it  should  be   digital  gold  or  whether  it  should  be   digital  cash.  And  I'm  convinced  that   that  war  being  won  over  by  the  digital   gold  people  was  the  single  biggest   mistake  in  the  history  of  Bitcoin,  in   the  history  of  Bitcoin.  and  that  if  it   had  gone  a  different  way  or  if  the   Bitcoin  community  is  able  to  correct  the   direction  and  make  the  Bitcoin  network   fast  enough  to  process  transactions  at   the  speed  and  the  cost  that  you  can  pay   for  a  cup  of  coffee  with  Bitcoin,  I   believe  that  that  is  the  path  not  only   to  sending  it  to  a  million  dollars,  but   to  fixing  money  globally.  Full  stop.   That  is  the  path  because  right  now  I   just  saw  for  the  first  time  this   article.  This  article  actually  didn't   blow  my  mind,  but  it  confirmed  something   that  I  feel  is  just  unfortunately  true,   which  is  that  medium  of  exchange  and   permissionless  finance  and  quick   permissionless  finance  that  you  own  your   own  assets  is  the  actual  biggest   breakthrough  here.  Obviously,  having  a   speculative  asset  to  make  money  on  like   Bitcoin  was  life-changing  for  the  early   cohort.  Having  a  fixed  supply  with  the   money  supply  is  amazing,  but  in  reality,   this  is  the  product  that  people  want.   People  want  a  stable  coin.  And  so   there's  forecast  now  that  Tether  may   flip  Bitcoin  itself.  And  to  be  honest,   to  be  honest,  guys,  I  actually  buy  that.   I  buy  that  because  Bitcoin  got   kneecapped  when  the  devs  chose  to  sell   its  soul  and  to  make  it  only  digital   gold  and  to  ignore  the  realities  that   people  want  fast,  cheap,  easy  to  access   and  that  that's  what  makes  financial   products  really  spread.  And  if  we  can   get  back  on  the  right  track  because  we   now  know  that  it  was  Mr.  J  that  funded   the  development  that  stopped  Bitcoin   from  being  what  it  should  have  been.  And   we  now  know  that  that  was  the  wrong   decision.  We  also  know  that  he  funded   Tether.  And  so  here  you  have  the  thing   that  derailed  Bitcoin.  You  you  see  the   clear  links.  The  question  is,  are  we  as   a  community  going  to  put  it  together?   Are  we  going  to  raise  the  awareness?  And   are  we  going  to  steal  back  the  soul  of   Bitcoin  that  was  stolen?  Because  when   you  look  at  the  Bitcoin  white  paper,  the   first  thing  it  says  is  peer-to-peer   electronic  cash  system.  That's  what   Satoshi's  vision  was.  it  was  cash.  And  I   hope  I  hope  that  we're  able  to  see  that   come  to  light.  And  if  that's  what   happens  during  this  bare  market,  which   is  a  focus  on  quantum  and  a  focus  on   making  Bitcoin  fast  and  usable  like   cash,  I  think  that  the  world  will  be  a   much  better  place.  And  that  will  send   our  bags  literally  to  Valhalla.  And  I  I   would  just  be  so  bullish.  I  would  be  so   bullish  on  that  as  an  innovation,  as  a   step  function  change.  Be  amazing.   Anyway,  that's  my  rant.  Uh,  in  other   news,   FTX  invested  500  million  in  Anthropic  in   2021,  securing  an  initial  stake  that  was   later  diluted  to  approximately  8%  by  the   time  of  FTX's  bankrupt  bankruptcy.   Anthropic  announced  today  that  it  closed   a  $30  billion  series  G  funding  at  $380   billion  post  money  valuation.  If  FTX  had   retained  its  stake  instead  of  selling   during  bankruptcy  proceedings  where  it   fetched  around  1.3  to  1.4  4  billion,   that  8%  stake  would  be  hypothetically   worth  about  $28  billion  today.   Absolutely  insane.  If  you  remember,  that   was  more  than  the  actual  entire   insolveny  of  FTX.  They  also  made  some   other  crazy  investments.  I  believe  their   Salana  stake  alone  uh  at  the  peak  of  the   recent  bull  market  would  have  been   worth,  you  know,  almost  10  billion  or   something  crazy.  It's  definitely  one  of   those  things  where  if  Sam  hadn't  gotten   caught  in  that  moment,  he  definitely   would  have  continued  on  rampaging   because  the  dude  made  some  crazy  moves   that  clearly  were  the  right  moves.  Um,   and  he  just  got  caught  with  his  pants   down  uh  using  money  in  the  wrong  ways  at   the  low  of  the  market.  But  this  guy   could  have  survived  that  if  he  didn't   get  called  out  by  CZ.  This  is  crazy.  FTX   would  have  been  the  biggest  financial   institution,  one  of  the  biggest   financial  institutions  in  the  world,  and   they  would  have  owned  most  of  what's   going  on  in  the  AI,  robotics,  and   emerging  health  trend  trade.  It's  just   crazy.  It's  just  insane  to  think  that  he   got  wiped  off  the  board.  And  I'm  sure   this  guy  will  probably  never  sleep   another  day  well  in  his  life  seeing   articles  like  this  because  this  is  more   money  than  he  owed  everyone,  right?  He   he  could  have  paid  for  every  single   dollar  that  was  missing  from  FTX  times   like  four  with  this  amount  of  money  that   that's  just  in  the  anthropic  investment.   Just  unreal.  Um  crazy.  I'm  just  boggles   the  mind.  Anyway,  um  I  know  that's  a   little  bit  of  a  random  piece  of  news,   but  I  wanted  to  bring  it  up  here.  Okay.   Uh  no  longer  are  you  going  to  have  that   little  thing  that  stops  and  starts  your   engine  in  your  car.  I  thought  this  was   just  such  a  good  such  a  good   announcement  because  honestly  it  is  the   worst  and  it  makes  the  car  unsafe.  If   you  have  that  moment  where  you're  making   a  left  turn  and  your  car  engine  just   stops  and  you  have  to  like  rev  the   engine  slightly  and  then  it  kicks  on,   that  can  be  the  difference  between  you   making  the  turn  safely  or  getting  caught   in  the  middle  depending  on  how  risky  you   play  it.  So  anyway,  this  I  think  is  a  a   small  step  for  man,  giant  leaf  for   mankind.   All right,  I'm  going  to  stop.  Let  me  do   a  little  bit  of  chatting  before  I  get   into  the  other  topics  cuz  I  have  some   other  topics  here.  I  have  some  other   topics.  I  just  want  to  get  in  the  chat   for  a  second.  What  happened  to  the  super   cycle?  Uh  brother,  we  got  we  got  cooked.   We  got  cooked  is  what  happened  to  the   super  cycle.  Um  I  believe  that  there's,   you  know,  I  believe  that  anything  is   possible,  but  right  now  the  market  has   completely  risked  off  and  I  would  argue   that  we  didn't  even  get  a  normal  cycle,   forget  a  super  cycle.  Uh  I  could  point   to  a  lot  of  reasons  why,  but  if  I'm   going  to  be  honest,  I  think  it  was   Trumpcoin.  I  think  uh  when  Trump   launched  his  coin,  it  drained  so  much   liquidity  from  the  ecosystem.  Every  coin   sold  to  jump  into  Trumpcoin  and  then   Melaniacoin  came  out  right  after.  And   what  happened  is  that  took  all  of  that   potential  wealth  created  by  people   leaving  other  coins  and  jumping  into   Trumpcoin  and  it  just  broke  it.  And  so   you  had  both  coins  got  drained  and  a  lot   of  the  I  think  uh  credibility  that   crypto  was  building  up  got  drained  by   that.  That  was  one  of  the  worst  thing   that's  ever  happened  in  our  industry.   Like  full  stop.  It  was  one  of  the  worst   things  that's  ever  happened  to  our   industry.  And  the  more  time  goes  by,  the   clearer  it  becomes  that  that  was  the   giant  derailing  of  crypto  in  2025.  So,   um,  yeah,  there  was  other  stuff,  but  I   think  that  Trumpcoin  was  was  one  of  the   worst  things  that  happened  to  us  as  an   industry.  And  I  believe  that  altcoins,   many  altcoins  would  have  uh  made  new   highs  in  2025  if  not  for  that.  That's   what  I  believe.  Okay.   Will  supernova  have  similar  emission   schedule  as  black  hole?  I'll  talk  about   supernova  in  a  minute.  It's  over  here.  I   have  it  here  uh  on  one  of  the  tabs.  So,   we'll  get  there  in  a  sec.  Uh  actually,   let's  do  supernova  now.  Let's  do   supernova  now.  Um  so,  a  lot  of  people   are  asking  about  supernova.  The  team  is   just  super  excited  to  drop  this  product   and  we  know  the  market  looks  really  bad   and  there's  no  sense  of  where  the  bottom   is  if  we're  here  uh  or  if  we're  going to   start  a  new  cycle  soon  or  what's  going   to  happen.  I  don't  want  to  be  uh  out   here  saying,  \"Oh  yeah,  altcoins  are   going  to  do  so  well.  Supernova  is  going   to  cook.\"  I  I  don't  know  what's  going  to   happen  with  Altz  or  the  market   shortterm,  but  I  can  tell  you  that  we   have  one  of the  most  talented  dev  teams   I've  ever  seen  in  my  life  cooking  up   this  product.  They  crushed  it  on  Black   Hole.  They've  absolutely  I  know  that   Black  Hole  obviously  got  cooked  by  AVAC   going  down  in  value,  but  the  exchange   still  processes  half  a  billion  dollars   in  transactions  every  week,  even  at   these  lows,  and  it  provides  better   returns  than  any  of  the  other  V33  dexes   in  the  industry.  Okay,  so  in  its   category,  it  cooked,  right?  However,  the   market's  just  been  horrible.  So  that's   the  reality  is  that  from  a  macro   standpoint,  it  got  caught  up  in  forces   stronger  than  it,  but  it  still  produces   fees  each  and  every  week.  It  still   produces  fees  for  its  holders  and  will   continue  to  do  so  hopefully  in   perpetuity.  Right?  And  the  opportunity   on  Ethereum  is  that  this  is  the  mother   chain  and  Vitalic  is  now  scaling  the  L1   to  the  point  where  high  transaction,   more  complicated,  more  rapid  fire   finance  like  what  happens  on  Salana  can   happen  now  on  Ethereum  and  over  time  it   will  be  more  and  more  the  case.  So  you   have  the  most  valued  chain  having   potentially  real  consumer  level  rapid   transactions  and  that  gives  Supernova  a   huge  design  space  to  work  with  not  just   in  launching  this  DEX  but  once  it  gets  a   foothold  expanding  the  product  line.  So   that's  what  the  team  wants  to  do.   They're  so  talented.  They  work  six  days   a  week  like  16-hour  days.  And  I'm  not   even  exaggerating.  I've  never  seen  work   ethic  like  this  out  of  a  team.  And  so   they  want  to  launch.  And  so  I'm  going  to   do  everything  I  can  to  support  this   launch.  and  hopefully  it  can  be  the  most   successful  launch.  And  uh  what  I  can   promise  you  is  that  this  team  is  built   differently  and  they  are  gritty.  Uh  I   cannot  I  cannot  comment  on  market   conditions,  but  I  can  say  that  once  the   product  gets  up  and  running  um  and  the   flywheel  gets  kicked  off  that  it  will  be   very  exciting  to  see  what  this  team  is   able  to  do  from  a  product  standpoint.   And  I  would  put  them  product-wise   against  any  other  team  in  the  industry.   That's  my  take.  And  if  you  want  to   potentially,  we're  obviously  going  to  do   something  really  sick.  We're  going  to   give  away  uh  a  a  big  bucket  of  VOVA  to   people  who  like,  who  retweet.  So,  go   follow  this  Twitter  x.com/supnovex.   Uh  and  make  sure  you're  following   because  I'm  going  to  be  putting  out  a   pre-launch  video.  Uh  you  can  get  a  some   free  VOVA  from  just  engaging  with  the   socials.  Definitely  do  that.  Obviously,   if  you're  holding  VB  Black,  that's  the   number  one  way  to  get  access  to  VOVA  or   if  you  participated  in  Warp  Speed.  So,   those  are  the  two  big  ways.  Obviously,   if  you're  holding  super,  you  got  a  ton   of  VB  Black.  So  now  you're  still  part  of   the  part  of  the  ride  if  you're  holding   that  VB  black.  Okay.  Uh  however,   Supernova  is  objectively  a  now  a  child   project  of  black  hole,  right?  So  it's   like  a  grandchild  of  the  Superverse  uh   project.  But  if  you  held  Super,  you   staked  it,  you  got  a  ton  of  V  Black.  If   you  had  any  of  the  NFTts,  you  got  a  ton   of  VB  Black.  If  you  had  uh  even  Neotokyo   or  Imposters,  you  got  a  ton  of  VB  Black.   And  so  everyone  who's  been  a  part  of  the   journey  has  ownership  and  a  stake  in   what's  happening  here.  And  I'm  hoping   that  this  can  be  a  truly  next  generation   product.  So  yeah,  anyway,  we're  putting   our  hearts  and  souls  into  the  product.   You  guys  know  I'm  always  going  to  shoot   it  straight.  The  market  looks  bad,  but   we're  going  to  keep  shipping  because   that's  all  we  know  how  to  do.  And  the   team  is  the  team  is  excited.  They  worked   their  tail  off  on  this.  So  I'm  hoping   you  guys  I'm  hoping  you  guys  are   excited,  too.  And  everyone  needs  a  good   free  lunch  in  the  bear.  So  hopefully   this  is  that  for  you.   Okay.  Uh,  let  me  hop  back  into  the  chat.   What's  my  opinion  on  Katana?  Um,  yeah,  I   haven't  seen  it.   Don't  launch  a  separate  channel.  Just   evolve  your  main  flow  into  a  broader   piece.  The  wider  trader,  markets,  tech,   macro  is  where  we  all  have  to  focus.  I   agree.  Uh,  I  agree.  Um,  I'm  going  to  be   honest  with  you.  I've  become   I  I  really  am  obsessed  with  AI.  But   here's  the  other  thing  about  AI  is  as   much  as  I'm  building  tools  to  make  my   life  better,  like  I  have  businesses.  I   have  this  content  uh  channel  that  I've   built,  you  know,  Elot  Trades  is  is  a   business.  I  have  Superverse  and  that   whole  team.  We  have  all  the  different   various  incendiary  parts  uh  from  black   hole  to  superverse  to  the  different   angel  investments  and  and  all  the   different  stuff  I  do  throughout  my  day   and  building  tools  to  make  my  life   easier  so  that  I  can  manage  teams  so   that  I  can  create  content  so  that  I  can   you  know  understand  what's  happening  in   the  world  and  track  it  that  has  been   super  helpful  but  I  don't  think  it's   like  worth  using  AI  in  this  way  where   you're  going  to  be  left  behind  because   the  truth  is  that  if  you  don't  have  a   business  that  you  can  iterate  on  and   make  more  successful  via  uh  using  AI   right  now  or  vibe  coding  something  then   I  don't  think  you're  missing  much   because  in  a  year  all  of  this  kind  of   nerdy  deep  diving  into  vibe  coding  is   going  to  be  made  redundant  by  people   you're  going  to  be  able  to  ping  Siri  and   say  hey  Siri  build  me  a  website  that   does  this  and  it'll  have  all  of  those   technologies  and  so  you're  only  getting   a  couple  of  months  maybe  a  year  or  two   at  max  of  an  advantage  here  now  at  that   point  you  know  the  vibe  coding  and  the   AI  tools  might  be  even  more  advanced  but   I  think  that  using  this  to  at least   lighten  the  load  on  your  day  is  step   one.  It's  kind  of  like  if  you  remember   Becker  had  this  thing  he  would  talk   about  where  he's  like  if  you're  stuck  in   life,  focus  on  eating  healthy  and   sleeping  and  doing  these  basics.  And  I   think  of  it  kind  of  like  that.  If  you're   overwhelmed  with  what  to  do  with  vibe   coding,  focus  on  making  your  day  just  a   little  bit  easier  with  it.  How  can  I   offload  that  repetitive  grindy  task  that   has  me  stuck?  Let  me  do  that.  Oh,  I   spend  a  lot  of  time  doing  emails.  Oh,  I   spend  a  lot  of  time  organizing  and   meeting  with  my  team  members.  Oh,  I   spend  a  lot  of  time  writing.  Whatever   the  thing  that  you  think  you  could   offload  is,  try  to  take  that  thing  and   make  it  automated.  And  that  would  be  the   way  I  think  that  you  make  AI  work  for   you  today.  I  would  not  recommend  trying   to  build  like  an  application.  I  think   that  that's  ridiculous.  I  think  that   there  will  be  no  moat  for  that  because   someone  else  can  build  one  in  5  minutes   and  it's  just  it's  just  not  worth   spending  the  time  or  effort  to  try  to   build  and  launch  an  application  right   now.  I  think  that  there  may  be  some   people  who  squeak  out  some  um  some  money   helping  people  learn  to  use  these  tools,   but  I  think  the  real  unlock  is  making   yourself  and  lightening  your  cognitive   load  so  that  you  can  be  a  better  person,   so  that  you  can  be  more  present,  so  you   have  more  time,  so  you  have  more  mental   focus  uh  to  do  the  things  you  want  to  do   and  and  most  importantly  so  that  you  can   reclaim  your  time  like  your  time  in  this   world  is  your  greatest  asset.  So  reclaim   it,  own  it.  And  uh  I  think  that's  a   beautiful  thing  that's  happening  with   this  current  wave  of  automation.  But  I   wouldn't  become  like  obsessed  with  AI.   And  what  I  am  obsessed  with,  what  I  do   think  this  makes  me  even  more  bullish  on   is  robotics.  And  I  believe  we  are  maybe   one  or  two  years  away  from  seeing  a  wave   of  IPOs  from  the  leading  robotics   companies  and  that  those  will  represent   the  single  biggest  opportunities  to   create  wealth  since  the  launch  of  early   Bitcoin.  you  know,  since  the  opportunity   to  get  in  on  altcoins  in  2016,  like   Ethereum  IPO  or  ICO,  I  think  that  the   new  wave  of  robotics  companies,  they  are   not  only  so  hard  to  replicate  and  that   there's  only  going  to  be  a  couple  of   these,  right?  There's  not  going  to  be   thousands  of  these,  there's  only  going   to  be  a  few  of  these  companies  that   really  reach  scale  and  the  competition   just  isn't  going  to  be  easy  for  people   to  get  in  on.  Uh,  and  as  proof  of  this,   you're  seeing  uh  articles  like  this.   Appronic  just  raised  $520  million.  Uh   for  full  disclosure,  I  am  a  holder  of   some  Appronic  private  markets  uh  private   market  uh  stock.  I  I  bought  secondaries,   what  they  call  off  someone  who  owns  some   Appronic.  And  so  I'm  a  holder  here.  Um   I'm  looking  to  get  a  massive  amount  more   of  this,  a  massive  amount  more.  In  fact,   this  is  kind  of  like  my  my  main  focus.   And  the  reason  is  that  there  will  be   this  wave  of  IPOs  where  we  start  to   finally  understand  that  we  will  have   solved  for  labor  and  it  won't  be   something  where  kind  of  like  AI  all   these  models  are  complete  competing  with   each  other  and  then  you  have  China   releasing  deepseek  and  then  China   releases  Cance  and  then  you  have  these   open-source  models  that  really  are  going   to  disrupt  the  underlying  LLMs.  I'm  not   convinced  it's  easy  to  navigate   investing  into  software  a  AI.  I  think   that  that  wave  has  probably  come  and   that  it's  also  very  vulnerable  to  these   open-source  models  that  can  probably  be   run  more  cheaply,  more  efficiently   locally.  I  don't  really  know  how  to   underwrite  the  risk  around  AI  processing   and  software  AI.  I  do  believe  that   hardware  AI  embodied  AI  and  robotics  is   where  investments  can  be  made  much  much   more  confidently  because  it  takes  tens   of  thousands  of  employees.  It  takes   decades  and  it  takes  a  ton  of  time  to   actually  catch  up  and  build  a  competing   product.  I  don't know if  you  remember,   but  remember  when  Elon  was  sleeping  on   the  floor  of  the  Tesla  factory  because   he  was  trying  to  get  from  Tesla  being   the  hottest  car  company  to  being  a  scale   of  producer  of  manufacturer  and  no  other   EV  company,  no  other  EVon  company  made   it  to  that  level  of  scale.  It  was  pretty   much  only  Tesla.  And  so  just  because  you   get  a  robot  out  doesn't  mean  anything.   It's  about  getting  to  the  scale  of   manufacturing.  And  only  a  few  companies   are  ever  going  to  be  able  to  pull  that   off.  And  so  I  think  that  when  you  think   of,  okay,  what's  the  opportunity  and  how   hard  is  it  going  to  be  for  someone  else   to  compete?  Robotics  are  going  to   represent  this  unique  opportunity  in  our   lifetimes  to  bet  on  something  which   could  fundamentally  change  humanity.   It's  going  to  do  what  it  says  on  the   tin.  It's  not  going  to  fail  to  deliver.   And  um  and  we  should  just  be  figuring   out  how  to  get  as  much  ownership  of   these  companies  as  we  can.  And  so  if  you   guys  are  interested  in  that,  I'm  going   to  be  building  um  I'm  going  to  be  trying   to  figure  out  ways  to  get  retail   involved  in  the  robotics  trade  because   right  now  the  biggest  issue  is  nobody   can  get  access.  And  I  think  of  it  almost   like  uh  like  a  human  rights  violation   that  people  can't  get  access  to  these   investments  because  these  are  the  most   important  in  my  opinion  opportunities   that  exist  on  the  board  today.  And  so  um   let  me  know  in  the  comment  section  below   uh  if  you  guys  are  interested.  I'm  going   to  be  trying  to  spearhead  this  and  build   a  retail  army  that  gets  access  and  gets   some  kind  of  access  to  these   investments.  That's  that's  my  goal  for   this  community.  Um,  and  I'm  going  to  be   trying  to  build  the  biggest  bag  uh  that   I  can  that  I  can  physically  uh   emotionally,  mentally  uh  because  I  think   this  is  it.  I  think  it's  the  big  one.   And  I  think  that  it's  probably  about  two   years  from  materializing.  So,  we  have   some  time.  But  that's  that's  where  I'm   at.  And  I'm  so  inspired  by  what's   happening  in  society.  It's  hard  not  to   be  inspired.  The  world  is  moving  into   hyperdrive.  AI,  robotics,  space  tech.   It's  just  it's  just  an  exciting  time  to   be  a  human.  So,  even  though  we're  in  a   bare  market,  I  think  it's  important  that   we  keep  our  heads  squarely  screwed  on,   that  we  don't  become  too  bearish  on   crypto  because  crypto  will  come  back.   The  big  boys  are  here.  It  will  be  the   future.  It  will  be  the  layers  by  which   AI  and  agents  actually  transact.  They   will  not  be  using  and  opening  up   brokerage  accounts  and  getting  flagged   for  spam  every  two  minutes.  And  I   believe  that  we  have  this  opportunity  to   see  robotics,  AI,  crypto,  space,  all  of   these  incredible  fields  become   transformative  investments.  And  that's   what  I'm  going  to  be  focusing  the   channel  on.  I  hope  you  guys  are  excited   about  it.  Let  me  know  if  you  guys  like   that.  Uh  that  next  era  for  me.  Um  do  me   a  favor,   go  ahead  and  give  this  is  this  can't   possibly  be  the  case.  This  can't   possibly  be  the  case.  About  29.  Go  give   this  a  retweet  for  me.  And  if  you  guys   are  enjoying  the  content  today,  go  ahead   and  smash  up  that  like  button  and  we   will  jump  back  into  the  chat.   Trying  to  find  people  to  sell  to.  I   don't  give  I  don't  care  if  you  guys  get   in.  I  really  don't  care  uh  at  all.   Genuinely,  I  I  hope  you  guys  get  in.  I   don't  care.  Um  I  feel  bad  that  you  won't   be  in.  Um  genuinely,  I  mean,  I  see  a  lot   of  comments,  oh,  why  can't  we  invest?   Why  can't  we  get  into  robotics  private   markets?  Um  you  have  to  be  accredited   investor  right  now,  but  if  you  don't   want  in,  don't  buy  it.  I  I  don't  care.   There  is  so  much  demand  for  this.  These   will  be  some  of  the  biggest  companies  on   Earth.  So,  I'm  I'm  beyond  excited  for   what's  going  to  happen  with  robotics.   And  if  you  don't  want  to  buy  it,  you  can   you  can  click  off  the  video.  You  can  go   close  your  eyes.  Uh  but  it's  not  going   to  stop  the  fact  that  if  you  create  an   infinite  labor  machine,  that  that's   going  to  transform  society.  And  the   creator  of  that  machine  will  probably  be   one  of  the  biggest  companies  on  Earth.   It's  not  a  not  a  very  confusing  thing  to   put  together.   If  USDT   makes  a  fake  push  towards  all-time  high,   what's  that  mean?  A  fake  push  and  it   doesn't  surpass  it,  would  it  go  into  a   reversal?  Let's  go  look  at  USDT.  D.   Let's  bring  this  up.   Um,   so  here  we  have  it  at   pretty  significant  highs,  huh?  Um,  so  I   don't  know.  I  don't  know.  I  think  that   one  thing  you  have  to  factor  in  here.   Let  me  go  ahead  and  take  this  to  the   actual  exact  pico  top  here.   Okay.  So  one  thing  you  have  to  factor  in   here  I  think  with  USDT  is  that  we  have   had  um  since  since  its  prior  dominance   peak  in  2022  that  was  under  Gendler  and   we  now  have  a  huge  pivot  into  regulated   stable  coins  and  stable  coins  being   fully  allowed.  Um,  and  the  question  is,   do  stable  coins  become  bigger  over  the   coming  10  years  as  a  piece  of  crypto   than  they  have  been?  Or  specifically   during  a  time  where  speculative  crypto   is  getting  really  not  that  much  love   right  now,  do  stable  coins  reach  a  new   high.  And  I  would  say  that  if  I  was  a   betting  man,  if  I  was  a  betting  man  and   I  would  say  that  if  we  are  still  not  at   the  bottom  of  Bitcoin,  I  wouldn't  be   surprised  to  see  us  plow  into  uncharted   territory  with  stable  coins.  You  just   have  to  think  of  the  context  which  is   that  in  the  context  of  2022  where  this   peaked  uh  this  was  not  a  friendly   regulatory  environment  for  crypto  and   definitely  not  for  stable  coins  like   Tether.  So  it  was  still  like  a  black   sheep  whereas  now  it's  pretty  much  a   part  of  the  presidential  administration.   I  mean  it's  a  huge  donor  huge  part  of   the  administration's  strategy  with   bringing  crypto  to  the  world.  So  I   wouldn't  be  surprised  at  all  if  Tether   ended  up  pushing  higher.  Now,  does  that   mean  it  has  to  happen  all  in  one  go?  No.   It  could,  you  know,  come  up  here,  fake   out,  come  down.  We  see  a  little  rally  in   crypto,  then  it  comes  up,  tries  again.   Like,  there's  no  there's  no  guaranteed   or  or  required  outcome.  But  are  you   saying  that  there's  under  no   circumstances  can  it  go  up  to  to  up  to   this  uh  above  9.3%.   I  wouldn't  bet  that  that's  some  kind  of   firm  barrier.  Does  it  make  sense?  It   would  make  sense  that  with  the  United   States  leaning  full  scale  into  stable   coins  as  a  way  to  monetize  their  debt   and  to  refinance  their  debt.  I  would   think  that  it  might  be  the  case  that  it   goes  higher  if  we  are  in  this  full-on   bare  market  which  I  think  for  lack  of  a   better  it's  just  a  safer  place  mentally   to  assume  we're  in  a  bear  than  to  hope   we're  not  cuz  hope  is  a  painful  thing.   When  hope  doesn't  go  your  way  it's   painful.  I  would  say  that  since  the   housekeeping  zone,  I've  been  very  clear   that  we  are  just  going  to  be  uh   reactive,  not  hopebased.  And  right  now,   as  you  can  see,  we  are  we're  forming  a   little  a  little  bottom  here.  Let  me  go   ahead  and  remove  all  this.  We're  forming   a  little  bottom  here,  right?  Like  we're   obviously  the  the  violence  for  today  is   over.  Um  but  can  we  get  above  here?  Can   we  get  above  here  on  Bitcoin?  Because   that's  the  first  step.  Getting  above  68K   is  the  first  step  to  getting  back  up   into  a  bullish  posturing.  But  what   you'll  see  here  is  the  last  few  times  we   bottomed  out,  we  got  up  to  here  and  then   here,  which  is  lower  each  time  than  even   the  prior  15-minute  interval.  And   honestly,   Bitcoin's  pretty  easy  to  trade  right  now   because  you  can  just  as  we  come  up  and   as  this  thing  comes  up  here,  you  can   say,  \"Okay,  well  probably  we'll  top   somewhere  around  here  if  this  trend  sort   of  continues,  right?\"  You  can  say,   \"Okay,  it'll  probably  top  somewhere   around  in  that  yellow,  you  know,  yellow   circle.\"  And  you  can  start  nibbling   shorts  here  and  then  know  that  if  it   gets  up  here,  well,  that's  the  first   time  that  it's  made  a  newer  high  above   the  15minute  mark  in  what  is  this  like  a   week  or  two?  What  is  this?  It's   Yeah,  like  a  week,  right?  So,  it  hasn't   it  hasn't  actually  gone  above  uh  its   prior  15-minute  high  since  actually  the   sixth,  Friday  the  6th.  So,  we  it's  now   been  um  almost  a  week  since  we've  even   seen  it  go  so  much  as  above  it  for  a   split  second.  It  didn't  go  above  it  for   much,  right?  It  had  this  little  freak   out.  You  can  pretty  much  put  a  short  on   and  say,  \"Okay,  this  is  my  stop  loss  is   this  prior  15-minute  high.\"  and  you  have   a,  you  know,  each  time  it  goes  up,  it  it   comes  down  like  4%.  So,  if  you're  doing   like  leverage  shorts,  you  can  make  40   50%,  60%  depending  on  what  what  leverage   you're  using,   you  know,  four  and  a  half%  on  these   drops  and  you  know  that  you  only  might   lose  whatever  this  is,  uh,  like  a  0.9%   that's  your  that's  your  error.  Bitcoin's   pretty  easy  to  short  right  now  because   you  have  these  fairly  predictable   patterns  that  it's  doing,  right?  Where   it's  just  kind  of  doing  these  little   scammy  pumps,  but  just  not  really   believable  pumps.  Now,  could  this  be  the   bottom?  Could  we  pivot  around  here?   Yeah,  sure.  Anything's  possible,  man.   Anything's  possible.  But  instead  of   hoping  and  praying,  let's  just  wait.   Let's  at least  wait  until  it  gets  above   the  prior  15-minute  high.  Like,  that's   not  crazy,  is  it?  That's  not  crazy  in  my   opinion.  Just  a  thought.  Just  a  thought.   But  anyway,   USD  uh  T.D.  maybe  it'll  fake  out  here   and  go  down.  I  don't  know.  Let's  just   wait  and  see.  Uh  here  you  go.  We  have  a   low  here.  We  have  like  a  uh  here's  a   good  way  to  do  some  TA  on  USDT.D.   You  have  this  prior  low  around  let  me   actually  do  it  with  real  real  lines.  You   have  this  prior  low  around  here.  This   little  wick  low  around  7.6  or  whatever.   And  then  you  have  a  prior  high  here.   Right  now  it's  just  in  a  range,  right?   But  obviously  with  a  bullish  posturing,   it's  been  going  up  and  up  and  up.  If  it   gets  above  here,  super  bullish.  If  it   gets  durably  below  here,  maybe  we  can   talk  about  a  reversal.  For  now,  we  just   we  don't  know.  But  we  would  assume   without  any  significant  piece  of   information  that  things  will  continue  as   they  are.  That's  the  safe  bet  is  assume   that  nothing  changes  unless  you  are   given  evidence  of  a  change.  And  smash   that  like  button.  Shout  out  to  Simon.   Simon,  you  win  today.

Yes,  we   would  get  all  zero  transactions  on   Cardono   stable  coins.  And  I'm  just  kidding,   guys.  I  know,  Cardano  people.  I'm  sorry.   Don't  Don't  roast  me.  Whatever.

I  I  think  I've  been  doing  more   videos  the  last  couple  of  weeks  than  I   have  done  in  years.  And  I'm  hoping  to   ramp  that  up.  I'm  going  to  be  doing  a   lot  more  content  on  robotics,  on  AI,  on,   you  know,  space  stocks,  on  the  different   types  of  interesting  investments  that   exist  today.
