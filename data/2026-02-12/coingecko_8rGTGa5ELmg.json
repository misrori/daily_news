Because  according  to  a  major   study  by  Krock,  you  probably  should  be   paying  a  lot  more  attention.  Over  $600   million  worth  of  tokens  unlock  every   week  and  90%  of  those  events  lead  to   negative  price  pressure.  [music]  So,  if   you  trade  or  invest  without  checking  the   unlock  schedule,  there's  a  good  chance   this  will  change  how  you  think  about  it.   Before  we  dive  into  the  details,  here's   a  quick  overview  of  what  the  report   looked  at.  K-Rock  broke  down  token   unlocks  into  three  main  angles.  First,   they  studied  how  prices  move  before  and   after  unlocks.  After  analyzing  over   16,000  events,  they  tracked  how  early   price  drops  start  and  how  long  it  takes   for  things  to  stabilize  afterwards.   Second,  they  looked  at  how  the  size  and   structure  of  an  unlock  affects  price   behavior.  This  includes  a  comparison   between  large  one-time  releases  and   gradual  distributions  over  time.  And   then  third,  they  analyzed  how  the  type   of  recipient  impacts  price.  [music]   They  compared  unlocks  that  go  to  teams,   investors,  communities,  or  ecosystem   funds,  and  found  meaningful  differences   in  how  the  market  reacts  depending  on   who's  getting  the  tokens.  So,  with  that   context  in  [music]  mind,  let's  walk   through  some  of  the  most  notable   findings,  starting  with  the  moment   unlocks  actually  start  to  affect  price.   According  to  the  data,  it  doesn't  all   happen  on  the  unlock  day.  prices  tend  to   start  slipping  about  30  days  before  the   event  with  the  pressure  intensifying   closer  to  the  release.  [music]   So  why  is  that?  Well,  Krock  points  to   two  forces  at  play.  Large  holders  like   funds  often  start  hedging  weeks  in   advance  to  reduce  risk  and  retail   traders  who  spot  the  unlock  coming  often   sell  early  to  frontr  run  the  drop.  So  by   the  time  the  tokens  are  actually   released,  much  of  the  selling  has   already  been  set  in  motion.  The  unlock   day  still  brings  a  spike  in  volatility   and  often  a  sharper  drop.  But   interestingly,  the  report  found  that   prices  tend  to  stabilize  fairly  quickly,   usually  within  2  weeks.  So  based  on  that   pattern,  Krock  suggests  exiting   positions  roughly  30  days  before  a  major   unlock  and  re-entering  about  14  days   after  once  the  market  has  had  time  to   settle.  Now,  Krock  also  analyzed  how  the   size  of  an  unlock  affects  price.  As  you   would  expect,  bigger  unlocks  tend  to   lead  to  bigger  price  drops.  They  grouped   events  by  how  much  of  the  total  supply   was  released  from  nano  ones  that   released  less  than  0.1%  of  the  total   supply  all  the  way  up  to  huge  unlocks  of   more  than  10%.  [music]   Now,  the  most  severe  reactions  came  from   unlocks  in  the  5  [music]   to  10%  range.  Those  caused  prize  drops   about  two  times  worse  than  smaller  ones.   But  oddly  enough,  the  biggest  unlock   events,  the  ones  over  10%,  didn't  always   perform  the  worst.  Sometimes  they  cause   less  immediate  damage  than  those  midsize   5  to  10%  drops.  So  Krock  explains  that   when  an  unlock  is  that  massive,  it's   almost  impossible  to  dump  it  all  at  once   or  fully  hedge  it.  So  their  impact  is   spread  out  over  a  longer  period  instead   of  showing  up  as  a  sudden  crash.  Krock   also  looked  at  the  structure  of  the   unlock  where  they  investigated  the   difference  in  price  impact  between  cliff   unlocks  and  linear  vesting.  So  a  cliff   is  when  a  big  chunk  of  tokens  gets   released  all  at  once  after  a  lockup   period  while  linear  vesting  means  tokens   are  released  gradually  over  time.  So  the   report  found  that  cliffs  tend  to  hit  the   price  harder.  That  sudden  spike  in   circulating  supply  is  tough  for  the   market  to  digest.  So  the  reaction  is   usually  sharp.  Now  with  linear  unlocks,   the  supply  trickles  in  at  a  steady   [music]  pace.  So  the  market  has  more   time  to  adjust,  meaning  less  of  a  shock   in  the  short  term.  But  that  doesn't   always  mean  the  price  holds  up  better  in   the  long  run.  Kirock  notes  that  when   small  unlocks  keep  happening  backtoback   like  in  long  monthly  vesting  schedules,   they  can  still  create  persistent   downward  pressure.  The  price  might  not   crash,  but  it  struggles  to  build  any   [music]  upward  momentum.  They  also   pointed  out  an  interesting  pattern  in   hybrid  structures  where  a  large  cliff  is   followed  by  linear  investing.  In  many  of   those  cases,  the  price  drop  from  the   cliff  tends  to  recover  after  about  a   month.  But  if  after  that  it's  just   constant  small  unlocks  with  no  breaks,   the  market  can  stay  suppressed  for  much   longer.  For  these  unlocks,  they  suggest   waiting  until  [music]  they're  completed.   And  if  that  timeline  isn't  feasible,   looking  at  who  the  recipient  is  may   provide  a  better  indicator  of  impact.   [music]  And  that  brings  us  to  the  last   part  of  the  analysis.  who  is  receiving   the  unlocked  tokens  and  how  that  changes   the  way  the  market  reacts.  So  they   grouped  recipients  into  four  main   categories.  Investors,  team  members,   community  related  like  airdrops  and   ecosystem  funds.  Now  almost  all  types   showed  a  negative  price  impact  to  some   extent,  but  the  scale  of  that  impact   varied  a  lot.  Team  unlocks  were  the   worst  by  far.  On  average,  these  trigger   drawdowns  of  around  25%  and  that  decline   often  began  over  30  days  before  the   unlock.  Krock  points  out  that  team   members  typically  don't  hedge  or   coordinate  sales.  And  these  tokens  are   often  part  of  their  compensation,  and   when  they  finally  unlock,  many  just  cash   out.  Now,  not  all  at  once,  but  in  this   steady,  [music]  unstructured  way  that   weighs  heavily  on  the  market.  They  point   to  Apecoin  as  a  case  in  point.  Starting   in  March  2023,  Ape  began  unlocking  about   $11  million  a  month  to  the  Yugalabs   team,  roughly  0.7%  of  supply.  Not  a   massive  number  on  its  own,  but  over  the   next  7  months,  Ape's  price  dropped  77%   while  ETH  was  only  down  9%.  Steady  team   selling  and  fading  interest  dragged   [music]  the  token  down.  Investor   unlocks,  on  the  other  hand,  were   surprisingly  tame.  Krock  looked  at  over   100  of  them  and  found  that  price   reactions  were  mild.  That's  because  most   funds  and  early  investors  manage  their   exits  carefully.  They  hedge  in  advance,   sell  through  over-the-counter  deals,  or   use  market  makers  to  avoid  spooking  the   market.  Community  related  unlocks  such   as  airdrops  had  mixed  results.  Some   people  dump  the  tokens  as  soon  as  they   get  them,  but  many  just  hold  either  out   of  loyalty  or  inertia.  And  that  balance   means  the  price  impact  is  usually   moderate.  Krock  described  it  as  tepid.  A   mild  dip  before  and  after,  but  nothing   dramatic.  Ecosystem  unlocks  were  the   outliers.  These  are  tokens  set  aside  for   developer  grants,  liquidity  incentives,   and  growth  programs.  On  average,  they   actually  had  a  small  positive  impact  on   price  because  the  tokens  are  being  used   to  strengthen  the  project,  not  dumped  on   the  market,  providing  liquidity,  funding   infrastructure,  rewarding  users.  These   all  create  activity,  which  helps  absorb   the  new  supply.  So,  they  highlighted   optimism  as  an  example.  In  June  2022,   the  project  unlocked  about  3%  of  its   supply  for  a  governance  fund.  After  a   short  dip,  the  team  distributed  36   million  OP  tokens  across  24  ecosystem   projects,  which  boosted  adoption  and   liquidity  and  helped  push  OP's  price   upward.  [music]   So,  what  does  this  all  mean?  If  there's   one  takeaway  from  the  Key  Rock  report,   it's  that  token  unlocks  are  far  from   neutral  events.  In  many  cases,  they're   one  of  the  most  predictable  sources  of   selling  pressure  in  the  market.  That's   why  checking  unlock  schedules  before   taking  a  position  makes  a  lot  of  sense.   So  look  at  when  the  next  unlock  is,  how   big  it  is,  and  also  who  is  getting  the   tokens.  That  alone  can  help  you  avoid   unnecessary  pain  or  time  a  re-entry  more   effectively.  And  also  it  doesn't  take   much  effort.  Platforms  like  Coin  Gecko   publish  token  unlock  schedules  for  most   major  projects.  So,  let  us  know.  Is   checking  unlock  schedules  already  part   of  your  trading  routine,  or  is  this  the   first  time  that  you're  really  thinking   about  it?   [music]",

    "summary_hu": "A tokent unlock, azaz a tokenek feloldásának ütemterve kulcsfontosságú tényező a piaci értékelés szempontjából. A Krock tanulmánya szerint a tokent unlock eseményei általában negatív árnyomást gyakorolnak, hiszen a heti 600 millió dollár értékű token feloldása 90%-os valószínűséggel áresést vonz. Az árak rendszerint 30 nappal az esemény előtt kezdenek csökkenni, amelyet a nagybefektetők és a kiskereskedők korai értékesítési reakciói okoznak. A nagyméretű unlockok jelentősebb ármozgásokat generálnak, míg a fokozatos feloldási struktúrák kevesebb zavaró hatást gyakorolnak. A legrosszabb árhatásokat a csapatok által kapott tokenek okozzák, míg az ökoszisztéma-alapú unlockingok jellemzően fokozzák az árakat. A befektetők és a közösségi kapcsolatok különböző hatással vannak a piaci reakciókra, ezért a feloldási ütemtervek vizsgálata érdemes a kereskedési döntések előtt.",

According to Krock's study, token unlock events tend to apply negative price pressure, as approximately $600 million worth of tokens become unlocked weekly, leading to price declines in 90% of cases. Prices generally start to decrease about 30 days prior to the event, driven by early selling reactions from large holders and retail traders. Larger unlock events generate more significant price movements, while gradual unlocking structures exert less disruptive effects. The most severe price impacts come from unlocks to teams, whereas ecosystem-based unlocks typically boost prices. The different impacts of recipients like investors and community-related unlocks highlight the necessity of examining unlock schedules as part of trading strategies.",
