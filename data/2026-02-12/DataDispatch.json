        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. Hope everybody is having a decent day out there as we're continuing to figure out what the heck is going on in the markets, especially as we have been rangebound and the S&P 500 is literally coiling up to be very tight here, waiting for that major catalyst. Whether that's a move to the upside or a move to the downside, uh the question is, you know, where are we going to be heading here? Um there's a lot of uncertainty that's starting to pull in right now. We're going to be talking about this especially with some of the individual names that have experienced the 30 to to a 50% correction though we have the market that's near all-time highs. So how do we prepare for that? What am I, you know, what am I personally doing in terms of trading and where are we sitting at some of the individual names that we've been covering on the channel a lot like Palanteer, Hood, and recently uh Amazon just due to its very cheap valuation uh the cheapest valuation basically in Amazon's history. We're going to be talking about that, what these potential moves could look like, uh, and whether we're talking about bottoms here or a falling knife that's continuing to fall. So, if you're a new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos. Let's pop it up on the screen here. Let's talk about Palanteer first. Now, Palanteer is still starting to experience, you know, selling pressure across the board. We had a nice bounce here, you know, when Palanteer kind of found a little bit of support here at the 133. Some temporary support here, just a little bit of breathing room, and we had that bounce last Friday. So far this week, we've continued to see selling pressure. Um, this stock is still continuing to look like it's breaking down a little bit. Uh, the thing here, you know, is where are we going to find the support? You're starting to see a lot of the bears that are coming out and a lot of people that are switching bearish on the charts on X talking about the Fibonacci retracements. What are we seeing for the pullbacks on Palanteer? You know, one of the big things in terms of timing the bottom, it all really depends on your time horizon. you know, uh we talked about this yesterday. You know, that's just the whole power of dollar cost averaging if you are a long-term kind of uh investor, have a long-term horizon. However, what you don't want to get caught with your pants beneath your knees here is taking any type of leverage moves, especially during a falling knife. Um if you're really taking a long position, uh one of the big things here, I like to hear the long investor had posted this uh talking about losing the 50 uh weight moving average. You see Palunteer right here uh looking at some different targets for possible fair value that they call you know one big thing you're going to see this start to appear across the board and you're going to see uncertainty that starts to really come in. Uh the more uncertainty the further big huge gap downs that we get that's the bigger chance for a bottom. Uh and of course we don't know where the bottom's going to be. One thing that we can say though is you know Palantry is a very resilient stock. So, I'm still bullish on the company in terms of the fundamentals and if I liked it, if anybody liked it here at 176, you know, now you got it at 134 and you could possibly get it cheaper. So, we'll see what happens. Uh, on top of that, it's kind of the same story that's happening with a lot of these other individual names. If we toggle over here to Robin Hood, literally that same thing is happening. Now, Robin Hood is experiencing a little more of a bounce. However, we still have Robin Hood that has fallen quite quickly after I lost that 100 support. you see almost like a little bit of a head and shoulders here. Not, you know, a ton, but um with that breakdown and of course you had the quarter four earnings, you know, expectations weren't as highly lived up to as what Wall Street was expecting in terms of the reality of the earnings being posted. Um even though the earnings were quite well, we still saw a decrease in some of the metrics and that's where you saw Robin Hood here that fell down about another 9% today. Now, Robin Hood had that nice bounce up here to about 85, but now back here in the 76s. So, the reason why, you know, there's uncertainty that's coming here is, you know, you got the SPY, the S&P 500 index that basically consolidated on the day. You have a ton of resistance right at that 7,000. Uh, and especially at the SPY right here at that 695. I mean, gosh, the resistance there is very, very strong. One of the big fears is, you know, that this is pretty close to all-time highs. dang near close to all-time highs. And a lot of these individual names have are kind of shaken up, broken, trying to repair themselves. And if we see any big changes in the macroeconomic environment, which we kind of did a little bit today with the whole um macroeconomic data that came out uh in terms of the numbers, the job numbers and stuff like that. And uh we are seeing decreasing probabilities for the interest rate cuts. That's where you can see the market because the market right now wants interest rate cuts, especially for risk on assets. That's where you're seeing a little bit of a pullback here. So, this could of course pop up over 7,000. If we get a hold above 7,000, that's where I'm going to be saying, okay, maybe the bull trade is back on the table. If we get a drop below, it's like, okay, now we're going to see a pullback in the broader market. How much further do these individual names have for a possible entry? Um, so that's where we're sitting at. We don't know what's going to be happening. So, personally, I'm just going to be kind of scalping here on short-term moves. Uh, just kind of hanging out, not making any crazy big moves. Uh, just due to the fact that this thing could really go either way at the sign of a single tweet. Um, so we look at Amazon right here. Amazon, same thing. A lot of the earnings that were sold off here. And last week, we did have good earnings from the Mega 7. And unfortunately, a lot of that was sold off due to the fear of cap X across the 7. And we even saw with Amazon that really, you know, fell here from the 220s all the way down to 204. Uh, one of the big things about Amazon, it's had a pretty decent value discount. A lot of people are saying if this breaks down further, we got this gap here from last May to fill between the 193 and 198. So, uh, one of the big things here, if Amazon continues to break down and lose that 200 support, now there is good support there and psychological support at the 200. You even have Aman here that is long on Amazon, also long on Meta. Uh the stakes are now raising here at this $200 support. I would agree with that. You got Kathy Wood here that's buying 34 million of Robin Hood just today. Um so we have a lot of the you know Arc Invest that has started to accumulate a lot of shares probably looking for a bottom here continuing at dollar cost average if they have higher prices uh or got in at some different areas. In terms of what's happening too with that non-farm payrolls report that showed really sharp jobs growth of 130,000 which is good for the labor market because of course then we had the unemployment rate that ticked down here to 4.3% from 4.4%. However, like we said that Federal Reserve interest rate outlook that could mean fewer rate cuts than traders are hoping for. So what does that put pressure on? That puts pressure on the CPI report for Friday. So personally I think tomorrow we could just see some more rangebounding. Uh you know some of the names that are more volatile especially in these kind of rangebound scenarios though are the high data center names the high beta data center names talking corewave cipher Iran. You know look at this movement here and volatility that we've had in u cipher just over the last 3 months here. You know, Cipher has had lots of swings up to the 18, gets sold off down to like the 14, back up to the 18, back down to like the 14 16 area. So, if this continues for Cipher, it'll be interesting to see if people are looking to possibly get more short-term day trade moves. Uh, but looking here in terms of Friday CPI report, uh, the market can hopefully understand the inflation part of the Feds equation. How is that going to look? What's inflation looking like? How is that going to be tied into the probability of interest rate cuts? Uh so that's what we're going to be looking at showing decent strength relies relies on us from the macro perspective you know not seeing hopefully an economic downturn one thing that that we are seeing an economic downturn in is is cryptocurrency and you're seeing Bitcoin here that's losing losing a lot of support uh Bitcoin and you can see extreme fear right here at 8 um Bitcoin back underneath 70,000 this thing cannot catch a break and you see the same thing with Ethereum back under 2,000. Uh, you know, what does that mean for BMR? BMR is hanging out right now at 1981. Uh, so, you know, I don't technically look at BMR that much since its price is, you know, so highly correlated to Ethereum's actual price. Um, but what you see on top of Bitcoin and Ethereum, one of the big things that this does have selling pressure on is actually Robin Hood because there is a lot of correlation between Robin Hood, crypto revenues, and just the actual individual equity price. So, for that, um, this is where if you see any type of a reversal in the crypto market, which you could possibly get in the near future, we'll show you something in just a second, that's where possibly you could see a little more bullish sentiment that's coming back into Robin Hood. Right now, we're just not seeing it. If this continues to drop, that could put more further selling pressure on Robin Hood. So, these are kind of all the examples just showing you why we have a lot of uncertainty. Um, in terms of this though, look at the previous Bitcoin crashes. Uh this was pretty interesting. Um looking at the extreme, you know, the fear and greed index. The LA, you know, when we've had the 1718 crash here, you extreme fear, COVID crash, FTX crash, you had extreme fear. And then right now, we're sitting at extreme fear of five. We the lowest on the actual fear and greed fear, you know. So, capitulation could be coming soon. Um however, I still think there could be possibly further pain ahead. We'll see what happens and especially with these individual assets. Let me know what you think, especially with the big retail and ones that are really popular right now in X. Uh you got Zeta right here at 1619, Path right here at 12. So, a lot of these are taking a beating. Is there further draw down or is a bottom here in the near future? I'll be personally, like I said, just kind of keeping an eye on the market, seeing what's going to be happening, and really taking a a good gander at that CPI report that comes out on a Friday. Peace out. Take care. Stay safe out there. I'll catch you guys later.",
        "summary_hu": "A piaci bizonytalanság növekvő jelei láthatók, különösen a Palantir és a Robinhood részvényeinek teljesítményében. Palantir esetében a befektetők 30-50% közötti korrekcióról beszélnek, míg Robinhood arra utal, hogy a 100-as támogatási szint elvesztése után esés tapasztalható. Az S&P 500 index erős ellenállással néz szembe a 7000-es szinten, ami a piaci hangulatot is befolyásolja. Az Amazon helyzete szintén aggasztó, ahol a részvények értéke jelentősen csökkent. A piaci elemzők óvatosak, ahogy az inflációs számokat és a jövőbeli kamatcsökkentéseket figyelik, hiszen ez további hatással lehet a piacokra.",
