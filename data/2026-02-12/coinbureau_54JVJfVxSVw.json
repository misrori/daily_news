    "transcript": "We  all  know  that  altcoins  have  been   underperforming  for  a  long  time  now.  And   everyone  wants  to  know  why.  After  all,   2025  was  set  up  to  be  the  perfect  year   for  face  melting  gains.  But  well,  that   didn't  happen.  And  for  most  of  us,  the   only  thing  melting  away  has  been  our   portfolios.  One  of  the  reasons  altcoins   haven't  performed  the  way  people  hoped   for  is  tokconomics,  especially  when  it   comes  to  token  unlocks.  Well,  a  recent   report  breaks  down  exactly  how  this  has   impacted  prices.  So,  today  we're  going   to  summarize  this  report  for  you  in   simple  terms,  tell  you  how  the  future  of   tokconomics  is  shaping  up,  and  look  at   what  this  could  mean  for  altcoins  in  the   future.  My  name  is  Guy  and  you're   watching  the  Coin  Bureau.   Today's  report  comes  from  Tokconomist,  a   leading  platform  providing  tokconomics   insights  and  is  catchy  titled  quote   annual  report  2025.  As  always,  you'll   get  the  juiciest  details  right  here  in   this  video,  but  we'll  leave  a  link  to   the  full  report  down  in  the  description   for  you  if  you're  interested.  Now,  the   report  kicks  off  with  token  buybacks.  In   2025,  there  were  $8.1  billion  in   buybacks.  A  massive  145%  jump  from  the   $3.3  billion  in  2024.  What's  crazy  is   that  79%  of  that  was  just  for  OKX's   exchange  token,  OKB,  with  Hyperlquid's   hype  in  second  place  at  just  8%.  Even   without  OKB  though,  monthly  buybacks   still  shot  up  in  2025  from  $70  million   in  January  to  $350  million  in  October.   That's  a  5x  jump,  mostly  fueled  by   Hyperlquid  and  ATA.  Even  more   impressive,  17  of  the  25  tracked  DeFi   projects  in  the  report  ran  buybacks  last   year,  often  sparking  huge,  albeit   short-lived  rallies.  That  said,  the   report  stresses  that  not  all  buybacks   are  equal.  Quote,  \"A  $10  million   Treasury  funded  buyback  redistributed  to   stakers  creates  fundamentally  different   dynamics  than  $10  million  in  revenue   funded  burns.  Same  dollar  amount,   opposite  tokconomic  impact.  So  the  key   takeaway,  always  check  where  that  money   comes  from  and  where  it's  going.\"  The   report  then  notes  that  while  token   unlocks  get  all  the  attention,  buybacks   are  just  as  important  since  they  have   the  opposite  effect  on  supply.  To   illustrate  this,  it  looks  at  the  90-day   performance  of  five  different  buyback   models  used  by  DeFi  projects.  The  most   successful  approach  was  funding  buybacks   and  burns  with  revenue.  Tokens  using   this  model  jumped  73%  on  average  in  the   first  90  days.  The  next  best  strategy   was  using  revenue  to  buy  back  tokens  for   the  treasury,  which  saw  gains  of  about   61%.  Pretty  solid  results  overall.  On   the  flip  side,  though,  projects  using   treasury  funds  for  buybacks  saw  tokens   drop  about  33%  on  average.  And  even   worse  were  projects  combining  sources   like  revenue,  protocol  fees,  and   treasury  funds.  Those  tokens  fell  on   average  around  52%  in  the  first  90  days.   Ouch.  The  report  also  notes  that   buybacks  aren't  for  every  project.  They   really  only  make  sense  for  established   projects  with  steady  revenue  and  a  solid   cash  reserve.  If  a  project  starts   burning  tokens  too  early,  that's   probably  a  red  flag.  The  report  also   notes  that  treasury  funded  buybacks  have   a  limited  runway.  There's  only  so  far  a   treasury  can  stretch.  Conversely,   revenue-funded  buybacks  are  much  more   flexible  since  they  can  scale  with  the   protocol.  Burning  tokens  is  usually  more   effective  since  it  permanently  cuts  the   supply,  while  keeping  repurchase  tokens   in  a  treasury  doesn't  obviously  have  the   same  effect.  That  said,  though,  treasury   held  tokens  can  still  help  with   ecosystem  growth  and  liquidity,   especially  for  newer  projects  with  less   certain  futures.  Buybacks  can  also  be   used  for  airdrops  or  to  boost  staking   and  attract  new  users.  Done  right,  this   shows  genuine  project  maturity  rather   than  just  using  buybacks  and  burns   purely  to  pump  the  price.  However,  the   report  points  out  that  quote  buybacks   mean  nothing  if  emissions  exceed  them.   For  instance,  OKB  achieved  a  46%   deflationary  rate  through  massive   buybacks  and  zero  emissions.  However,   Ether  bought  back  2%  of  its  supply  while   emitting  64%  which  still  resulted  in  62%   inflation.  The  report  then  highlights   OKB's  success  in  2025.  With  $6.4  billion   in  buybacks  funded  entirely  by  protocol   revenue,  OKB  jumped  about  300%  in  just  a   few  days,  which  is  insane.   Even  crazier,  OKB  burned  93%  of  its   supply  that  year,  one  of  the  biggest   token  burns  in  crypto  history,  bringing   its  total  supply  down  to  21  million  to   mirror  bitcoins.  Another  standout  is   Hyperlid,  which  devoted  a  whopping  97%   of  all  trading  fee  revenue  to  continuous   buybacks  and  burns,  the  most  aggressive   setup  in  all  of  crypto.  And  with  hype   capped  at  1  billion  tokens,  this  creates   serious  deflationary  pressure.  Then   there's  Ave,  which  kicked  off  $50   million  in  annual  buybacks  last  April.   20%  of  that  went  to  liquidity  providers,   while  the  other  80%  went  to  Anti-Go   stakers,  basically  an  incentive  system   for  Ave's  Go  stablecoin.  Anyhow,  the   report  notes  that  Ave  didn't  see  the   same  price  jump,  but  the  model  is   sustainable  since  buybacks  are   distributed  as  ecosystem  rewards,   helping  attract  new  users.  In  any  case,   the  report  sees  $8.1  billion  in  buybacks   last  year  as  a  sign  of  crypto  maturing.   More  importantly,  though,  it  emphasizes,   quote,  the  2025  buyback  wave  will  not  be   remembered  for  dollar  amounts.  It  will   be  remembered  for  which  protocols   understood  that  where  money  comes  from   and  where  tokens  go  determines   everything.  Definitely  something  to   remember  next  time  you  dy.  Okay,  then   the  next  part  of  the  report  zooms  in  on   how  token  burn  mechanics  have  evolved   across  different  projects.  But  first   though,  I  need  to  tell  you  about  the   Coin  Bureau's  Telegram  channel.

So,  sign  up  today   using  the  link  in  the  description  or  the   QR  code  on  screen  now.  But  back  to  the   report,  which  points  out  that  token   burns  used  to  be  mostly  about  cutting   supply  and  driving  short-term  hype.  But   in  2025,  projects  started  using  burns  to   create  long-term  value  instead.  The   report  highlights  three  burn  mechanisms   that  emerged  last  year.  The  first  is   using  a  portion  of  project  revenue  to   burn  tokens.  This  method  is  predictable   since  revenue  is  easy  to  track,  but  it   can  attract  regulatory  scrutiny,   especially  around  securities  laws,   because  it  closely  resembles  stock   buybacks.  The  second  method  uses  an   algorithm  to  burn  tokens  directly  from   the  treasury.  It's  lower  risk  from  a   regulatory  perspective,  but  also  less   predictable.  The  third  method  is   governancriven  burns,  where  the   community  decides  how  much  to  burn  and   when.  This  is  the  most  transparent  and   decentralized  burn  approach,  but  the   least  predictable  since  future  votes   could  potentially  reverse  them  by   increasing  token  issuance.  Next,  the   report  looks  at  how  exchange  tokens   tweaked  their  burn  mechanics  in  2025.  It   starts,  of  course,  with  OKB  repeating   the  same  headline  figures  from  earlier.   6.4  billion  burned,  93%  of  supply  gone,   and  a  46%  deflation  rate.  All  that  good   stuff.  But  another  example  is  BNB,  which   burned  $4.7  billion,  cutting  supply  by   3%.  with  zero  net  emissions.  That  was   pure  deflationary  pressure.  Bit's  BGB   token  joined  the  burn  party,  too,   burning  over  1.3  billion  worth  and   cutting  supply  by  about  15%.  The  catch,   though,  is  that  BGB  added  12%  back   through  emissions,  so  net  deflation  was   only  3%.  Still  better  than  being   inflationary.  But  it's  not  just  exchange   tokens.  Major  layer  1's  have  tweaked   their  burn  mechanisms,  too.  Ethereum,   for  example,  burned  around  $280  million   of  ETH  in  2025.  Still,  ETH  ended  the   year  slightly  inflationary  at  0.5%   mainly  because  users  moved  to  layer  twos   after  the  Denune  upgrade  made  them   cheaper  and  more  efficient.  This  reduced   the  amount  of  ETH  being  burned  through   mainet  transactions.  Another  major   change  came  from  Salana,  which  made  the   biggest  burn  tweak  in  2025.  In  February,   a  Salana  improvement  document  or  SIMD   changed  how  priority  fees  are  handled,   cutting  Soul's  daily  burn  rate  by  about   95%.   Overall,  Salana  burned  $338  million   worth  of  Soul,  roughly  0.3%  of  its   supply.  But  with  staking  emissions   adding  4.2%,  Soul  ended  the  year  3.9%   inflationary.  Other  layer  ones  stayed   inflationary  too  despite  burning  tokens.   The  report  highlights  Avalanche,  NIA,   and  Aptos,  all  of  which  have  token   issuances  that  dominate  their  supply   dynamics.  Surprisingly,  meme  coins  led   the  way  in  token  burn  adoption  in  2025.   Pingu  burned  38%  of  its  supply  while  Bon   burned  12%.  Both  were  teamdriven   decisions,  which  the  report  sees  again   as  a  sign  of  maturity.  less  risk  of  the   team  dumping  tokens  on  investors  later.   The  report  also  highlights  two  major   governance  events  in  2025.  The  first  was   with  Hyperlid  where  a  validator  vote  in   December  approved  converting  trading   fees  to  Hype  and  sending  them  to  a  de   facto  burn  address  with  no  private  keys.   This  cut  Hype's  fully  diluted  valuation   or  FDV  by  $1  billion  and  trimmed  its   circulating  supply  by  13%.  The  second   big  governance  move  was  unis  swap's   unification  proposal  approved  the  day   after  hyperlquids.  It  burns  100  million   UNI  from  the  treasury,  flips  on  fee   switches,  and  adds  other  features  that   boost  token  burns  to  make  UNI   deflationary.  The  report  calls  this   quote  the  most  sophisticated  burn   mechanism  in  DeFi.  Either  way,  the   report  sees  a  clear  pattern.  Investors   care  more  about  consistent  burns  than   one-off  events.  While  key  metrics  to   watch  in  2026  include  the  percentage  of   supply  burned,  the  30-day  burn  value,   the  burn  type,  whether  it  was   programmatic  or  discretionary,  and  the   reasons  tokens  were  burned  in  the  first   place.  Okay.  The  next  part  of  the  report   looks  at  seven  major  token  generation   events  or  TGE.  At  launch,  these  projects   had  a  combined  market  cap  of  $9.3   billion  and  had  raised  $3  billion.  They   include  Bio  Protocol,  Beer  Chain,   Plasma,  Kao,  Pumpfun,  Story  Protocol,   and  Monad.  What's  wild  is  that  all  seven   projects  tanked  in  2025,  averaging   losses  of  over  60%.   Many  started  with  billion  dollar  market   caps,  but  that's  definitely  not  the  case   anymore.  And  to  make  matters  worse,  over   half  a  billion  dollars  of  their  tokens   are  set  to  unlock  in  2026.  Not  great.   Now,  of  the  $3  billion  raised  across  the   seven  projects,  Pump.  Fund  took  the  lion   share  at  $1.8  billion,  or  about  60%  of   the  total.  Notably,  pump  was  one  of   three  projects  to  primarily  raise  funds   publicly  along  with  plasma  and   bioprotocol.   The  other  four  raised  most  if  not  all  of   their  funds  privately.  Naturally,   projects  with  extreme  fully  diluted   valuations  or  FDVS  got  hit  the  hardest.   For  context,  FTV  is  basically  what  a   project  would  be  worth  if  all  its  tokens   were  in  circulation.  It  helps  show  how   big  a  project  could  get  and  whether  the   current  price  is  under  or  overvalued.   Anyhow,  the  report  highlights  Kito,   which  raised  $10  million,  but  launched   at  a  $2.8  billion  valuation  with  a   massive  $261x   FDV  multiple.  Unsurprisingly,  it  dropped   about  80%.   Bio  Protocol  tells  a  similar  story,   launching  at  $2.8  8  billion  after   raising  just  $37  million,  a  77x   multiple.  Its  bio  token  collapsed  by  an   incredible  94%.  Plasma's  XPL  and   Barerchains  beer  followed  the  same   pattern,  both  with  huge  multiples  and   falling  roughly  88%  and  87%   respectively.  Conversely,  projects  with   more  reasonable  FDV  multiples  held  up   much  better,  though  they  still  took   losses.  For  instance,  Pump.fun  launched   at  a  3x  multiple  and  only  fell  38%  while   Monad  came  in  at  a  6x  multiple  and  lost   just  20%.  Intriguingly  though,  Story   Protocol  was  the  exception  to  the  rule.   It  launched  with  a  19x  multiple  but  only   fell  9%,  making  it  the  best  performer   among  the  seven  projects.  The  report   puts  that  down  to  strong  project  quality   outweighing  negative  price  action.   Either  way,  the  report  points  to  Bio   Protocol  as  a  clear  example  of  valuation   disconnect.  Raising  $37  million  couldn't   justify  a  $2.8  billion  FDV  and  a  77x   multiple,  especially  with  just  47%  of   tokens  in  circulation.  After  that  94%   collapse,  BIO's  valuation  dropped  to   just  $78  million,  giving  it  a  more   reasonable  $2.1x  multiple.  It's  a  stark   reminder  that  extreme  premiums  aren't   sustainable  without  real  network  effects   or  revenue.  For  what  it's  worth,  though,   the  report  found  no  correlation  between   the  performance  of  these  projects  and   whether  they  raised  funds  publicly  or   privately.  Okay.  Next,  the  report  looks   at  projects  that  made  major  tokconomics   changes  in  2025,  starting  with  Jupiter.   JUP  launched  back  in  2021  with  a  fixed   supply  of  1  billion  tokens,  zero   emissions,  and  a  clean  50/50  split   between  community  airdrops  and  the  team.   But  in  early  2025,  a  governance  proposal   slashed  JUP's  supply  from  10  billion  to   7  billion  tokens.  That  30%  cut  applied   only  to  Jup's  non-irculating  supply,   preventing  3  billion  JUP  from  entering   circulation.   Moreover,  future  community  airdrops  are   now  decided  through  governance  votes   rather  than  the  protocol.  Another   example  is  Wormhole,  which  launched  back   in  2020.  The  original  vesting  schedule   for  the  W  token  featured  annual  cliffs   leading  to  huge  token  unlocks.  But  in   September  2025,  Wormhole  rolled  out  a   major  tokconomics  overhaul  with  W   version  2.0,  introducing  the  wormhole   reserve,  and  tweaking  governance  staking   rewards.  More  importantly,  wormhole   smoothed  out  its  vesting  schedule.  Key   allocations,  namely  Guardian  nodes,   community  and  launch,  ecosystem  and   incubation,  and  strategic  network   partnerships  now  unlock  bi-weekly   instead  of  annually.  Meanwhile,  investor   and  guardian  validator  vesting  got   pushed  back  6  months  with  final  unlocks   now  set  for  October  2028.  Notably,  this   doesn't  affect  how  many  W  tokens  will  be   issued,  but  it  does  alter  how  heavily   they'll  enter  circulation.  Another   example  is  Salana,  which  launched  with   an  8%  inflation  rate  that  declines  by   15%  each  year  until  it  reaches  a  steady   1.5%.   Newly  issued  soul  is  used  to  reward   validators  with  some  allocated  to  the   Salana  Foundation  to  fund  development.   The  report  notes  this  would  cut  total   emissions  by  roughly  22  million  soul  and   could  make  staking  more  attractive  than   DeFi  lending  or  liquidity  provision.  The   report  also  points  out  that  this  serves   as  a  reminder  that  inflationary   tokconomics  are  a  double-edged  sword.   They  can  incentivize  ecosystem  growth   and  network  security  through  validators,   but  can  also  cause  dilution  over  time   and  could  discourage  long-term   participation.  Either  way,  these   adjustments  show  a  broader  shift  in  how   mature  projects  approach  tokconomics.   That's  because  projects  can  now  rely  on   real  data  instead  of  pre-launch   assumptions.  And  finally,  the  report   looks  at  some  of  2025's  most  notable   unlocks.  Now,  as  basic  economics   dictates,  an  increased  supply  while   demand  stays  the  same  means  prices  will   go  down.  However,  the  report  notes  that   the  reality  is  more  complex  as  a   project's  fundamentals,  market   conditions,  token  utility,  and   speculation  all  play  a  part,  too.  With   that  in  mind,  the  report  tracked  token   unlocks  across  10  projects,  ranging  from   $584  million  to  2.3  billion.  The  biggest   was  Whitebit  with  $2.3  billion  in  WBT   unlocked,  boosting  its  supply  by  15%.   Despite  this  though,  WBT  rallied  136%   thanks  to  strong  revenue,  utility,  and   burn  mechanisms.  Notably  though,  WBT  was   the  only  tracked  token  to  see  gains   instead  of  losses.  Athena  is  another   standout  with  $1  billion  in  ENA  tokens   unlocked,  growing  its  supply  by  140%  in   2025.  Perhaps  unsurprisingly,  ENA's   price  dropped  73%.   Ono  is  another  example  with  $860  million   in  Onondo  unlocked,  growing  its  supply   by  134%.  This  sento  lower  by  67%.   Even  Dogecoin  with  just  a  3%  supply   increase  fell  by  52%  while  Avalanch's  9%   supply  growth  caused  Avac  to  fall  by  60%   in  price.  Meanwhile,  Worldcoin's  massive   $1.1  billion  unlock  ballooned  its  supply   by  76%,  pushing  its  price  down  71%.   The  report  also  highlights  10  projects   that  saw  extreme  dilution  with  supply   increases  ranging  from  231%   to  a  massive  858%.   Now,  you'll  have  to  check  out  the  full   report  to  see  which  cryptos  these  were,   but  the  key  takeaway  is  that  all  10   projects  saw  their  tokens  fall   dramatically.  In  fact,  the  smallest  drop   was  66%  and  some  projects  even  went  to   zero.  Yikes.  And  with  that  folks,  we've   reached  the  end  of  this  report.  And   remember,  you  can  check  it  out  in  full   in  the  description  below.  So,  what  does   this  mean  for  crypto  in  2026,  especially   when  it  comes  to  tokconomics?  Well,  if   there's  one  theme  that  stands  out  in   this  report,  it's  project  maturity.   Crypto  projects  are  increasingly   tweaking  their  tokconomics  based  on  real   market  data  to  create  value  and  extend   their  longevity.  It's  clear  that  the   projects  taking  these  proactive  steps   are  the  ones  most  likely  to  succeed  in   the  long  run.  Now,  this  is  something   that's  being  discussed  by  many  analysts   with  some  dubbing  it  tokconomics  2.0.   Basically,  this  model  encourages   projects  to  develop  their  structures  in   a  way  that  provides  value  back  to  token   holders.  This  could  include  airdrops  or   protocol  revenue  distributed  to  users.   We  suspect  that  many  new  projects  will   start  with  this  tokconomics  2.0  model   ready  to  go.  Another  factor  meanwhile   likely  to  shape  altcoin  performance  in   2026  is  large  token  unlocks.  Although   from  our  experience,  these  events  often   turn  out  to  be  nothing  burgers.  That's   simply  because  not  all  unlock  tokens  are   immediately  sold.  Instead,  price  drops   are  usually  caused  by  existing  holders   panic  selling  to  try  and  frontr  run  the   unlock.  Ironically,  that  fear  often  does   more  damage  than  the  unlock  itself.  That   said,  though,  it's  important  to  keep  an   eye  on  token  unlocks  before  they  happen.   A  few  big  ones  lined  up  for  2026  include   Whitebit,  which  will  unlock  81  million   WBT  on  the  13th  of  March,  boosting  WBT   supply  by  27%.  And  pumpf  fun,  which  has   82  billion  pump  unlocking  on  the  12th  of   July,  inflating  its  supply  by  19%.   Meanwhile,  other  unlocks  are  much   smaller.  For  instance,  Arbitum  will   unlock  92  million  ARB  on  the  16th  of   February,  a  1.8%  supply  growth,  while   Suie  will  unlock  43  million  tokens  on   the  1st  of  March,  a  1.1%  increase,  and   Athena  will  unlock  171  million  ENA  on   the  5th  of  March,  a  2.2%  increase.  All   things  considered,  these  are  pretty   minor,  and  we'll  leave  a  link  in  the   description  in  case  you  want  to  track   these  events  yourself.  In  any  case,  if   you  take  anything  away  from  today's   video,  folks,  it's  to  remember  to  factor   tokconomics  into  your  research.   Unfortunately,  this  is  an  important   factor  that  many  investors  overlook,  but   it's  something  you  must  become  familiar   with  if  you  want  to  have  an  edge  as  a   successful  crypto  investor.  After  all,  a   project  can  have  the  best  tech,  the  best   team,  and  the  best  marketing,  and  indeed   everything  else.  But  if  it  has  piss  poor   tokconomics,  well,  it's  likely  doomed   from  the  start.  A  project's  tokconomics   can  be  what  determines  if  it  pulls  a   100x  or  goes  to  zero.  And  if  you're  not   sure  how  to  assess  tokconomics,  then   don't  worry.  It's  not  as  intimidating  as   it  might  sound.  And  luckily,  we  have  a   video  that  will  teach  you  how  to  do  just   that,  which  you  can  find  right  over   here.   And  that  is  just  about  all  from  me  for   today,  though.  But  we  want  to  hear  from   you  now.  What  tokconomics  features  do   you  hope  to  see  in  2026?  And  will   altcoins  ever  recover?  Let  us  know  your   thoughts  in  the  comments  below.  If  you   want  to  see  how  institutions  feel  about   Bitcoin,  then  check  out  the  video  right   over  here.  And  if  you  want  to  see  what   could  happen  in  the  crypto  market  in   2026,  then  check  out  the  video  right   over  here.  Okay,  thank  you  all  for   watching  and  I'll  see  you  again  very   soon.  This  is  Guy  signing  off.",

    "summary_hu": "A videó a tokonomikával foglalkozik, amelynek a 2025-ös évre vonatkozó adatai szerint az altcoinok teljesítménye folyamatosan romlik. A tőzsdei részvények visszavásárlása látványos növekedést mutatott, viszont a szállítási tokonomikai modellek, különösen ha a költségvetési forrásokból származtak, általában nem teljesítettek jól. Az báoált utánzó rendszerek mellett az égetések típusai is fejlődtek, mivel a projekt során a közösségi kormányzás jött előtérbe. Fontos kiemelni, hogy a projektek környezeti adatok figyelembevételével kezdik meg a tokonomikai modelleket adatai alapján kialakítani, jelezve ezzel a projektek érettségét. A jövőbeni kilátások vegyesek, és bár a bitcoinok esetében van ok a reményre, az altcoinok helyzete kérdéses marad.",
    "summary_en": "The transcript addresses the current state of altcoins, presenting evidence of their prolonged underperformance. Notably, buybacks in 2025 showcased a striking increase, yet economically-driven models, particularly those funded by treasury resources, often underperformed. The evolution of burn mechanisms indicates a shift towards community-driven governance. Importantly, projects are beginning to tailor their economic models based on real data, pointing towards maturity. Future outlooks are mixed; while there is hope for Bitcoin, the prospects for altcoins remain uncertain.",
