        "transcript": "Okay, then I've got a juicy show for you today. In the first clip I'm sharing with you guys, Dan Ies makes the case that software stocks like Salesforce and Service Now are at a generational buying opportunity. And he's talked to 40 or 50 CTOs, which he thinks backs this claim up. And then in the second clip I've got for you, we're looking at why American big tech is spending over half a trillion dollars on AI while China is getting results for a fraction of that and why the market is reacting to these two things in completely opposite ways. And then finally, I've got a bonus clip for you guys at the end, which is the debate over what Open AI needs to do to get back into pole position of AI. If you're following AI and stocks and markets, I don't know where else you'd rather be. Check this out. >> Dan Ives is here, star analyst of Wedbush. Um, I mentioned at the top of the program that you moved a couple of really beaten down names into your your AI20, that being Salesforce and and Service Now. Um, what do you make of what Jensen said amidst all of this skepticism about that space? >> I think the hearts and lungs of the AI revolution will be in software. Now look, right now it's data center buildout, GPUs. I mean, you're still in the early days of this what what's going to be a 10-year buildout, but software is going to be key of the use cases. I mean, it goes to our point. If you look at Palunteer and ultimately followed by Snowflake and in my opinion, to say Salesforce and Service Now are structurally broken companies, to me, look, in my career, it's I think it's the most disconnected call that I've ever seen. investors thinking that software is not going to play a huge part of the AI revolution. >> It will. That's not to say that certain ones aren't being disintermediated in a extraordinarily large way or there's a belief if they're not today that they will be tomorrow. Right? As as Brad Gersonner was telling me, you're not selling these stocks because you are so upset with what's happening today. But you now more than ever need to see some justification for the multiples that these stocks have commanded. Let's take that. What what is the what's the PE of Salesforce and Service Now? Can we show that there? There it is. So, okay, Salesforce down to 15. The forward on service is is almost 25. Is that justified? Well, it's my view that like the monetization because like when I when I look at the revenue for a service now or Salesforce, I could argue there's 20 30% incremental revenue from where they are today. We're talking, you know, ultimately tens of billions of dollars you when it comes to Salesforce that are not factored in to the valuation because I get in the near term it's a headwind. bending off I I think would be the first one to admit it but to say that Salesforce and Service Now given how integrated they are in enterprises in the stack you look at the hundred thousands of customers as these use cases play you haven't seen it today but in the next 6 9 12 18 months I think what Jensen talked about is exactly right you cannot paint all of them with the same brush you can't just say an SMV pure play is they're going to be impacted as much as a Salesforce, an Adobe, a workday. >> I mean, not everything has traded miserably, but but obviously so many have. I mean, when you look at all these companies, how do you know what justifies a higher multiple versus ones that don't? We showed a pretty good discrepancy in the forward pees of both of these names, which have equally gotten hammered. You can maybe can you look at a salesforce and say okay at 15 times earnings that stock has corrected enough that it looks attractive but just because you can make that case for one doesn't necessarily mean you can make it for the other but you are because I view it as snow salesforce is the one if there's one name that's been so dislocated relative to what I believe what the opportunity would be it's Salesforce and I could also argue some of the cyber security names like Pow Alto and Crowdstrike when I look at Service Now betting against McDermott has been the wrong move. If you look at that install base now, I could say they were early on in terms of AI and now they're really sort of being viewed as they're going to be disintermediated. But Scott, like I've talked to what 40, 50 CTO's, csos, IT managers over the last week to make sure the stress has to make sure that I'm not looking at wrong and I feel further conviction in this. >> So can you adjust those those that's like asking people on the on the football team, hey, how's the team? Everybody's like, \"Hey, we're great. Everything's great. Can you can you trust that you're getting the the best opinions on what's really happening by asking the people who are at the companies where their stocks are are declining? Aren't they all trying?\" >> I'm talking about the buyers. I mean, the buyers of Salesforce, the buyers of Service Now, the buyers of cyber security. And I feel I come away viewing this as I mean, I'd say it's a generational type of opportunity in terms of what's happening in software. >> Okay. Let me ask you this. Microsoft got downgraded today by Melius, which says, quote, \"Satcha lost the AI narrative.\" I know you you're gonna counter that. Um, but doesn't the stock kind of worry that Melius is right? >> Yeah. and and Ben an analyst you know who I have huge respect for I think >> but is there >> but but you the AI revolution is not gonna be successful unless Microsoft successful because of how integrated they are in enterprises in Azure in the backyard of you know ultimately really the core enterprises movement to AI have they hit some sort of perception soft spot here relative to Azure relative to capex in terms of that not all being allocated ated to Azure. Yeah, but I think this is one where when I look at Microsoft, I think it's a stock that has a five in front of it and a six in front of it over the next 12, 18, 24 months. I just think near-term right now, it's a guilty till proven innocent. >> Enterprise software companies are sitting on 20 to 30% of unrealized AI revenue that the market has completely priced out during this recent sell-off. So Dan's core argument is pretty straightforward. Salesforce at 15 times forward earnings. Service Now at 25. And he's saying the market is treating these companies like AI is going to destroy them when it's actually going to be one of the biggest revenue drivers they've ever had. And I think he's got a real point. These companies are embedded in tens of thousands of enterprises. They're in the stack. You can't just rip them out and replace them with a chatbot. The switching cost with a chatbot or some recently vibecoded software. the switching costs alone would take years. Dan's also claiming he spoke to 40 or 50 CTO's and IT managers in a single week. Now, the CNBC host pushed back on that. Said that's like asking the football team how the team's doing. Fair point. But Dan clarified he's talking to the buyers, not the sellers. The people actually writing the checks for software. And those conversations are telling him that AI use cases are coming. They're just 6 to 18 months away from showing up in the revenue numbers. So, you've got this window where the stocks have been crushed, but the revenue hasn't yet materialized. That's where Dan sees the opportunity. The Microsoft downgrade is interesting, too. It was said that Satia Nadella lost the AI narrative and Dan pushes back hard on that. His argument is basically the AI revolution can't succeed without Microsoft because of how deep Azure is in the enterprise infrastructure. And I think he's right about that. You can debate whether Microsoft is executing perfectly, but the idea that they're somehow going to miss the AI wave when they're one of the three or four companies that every enterprise depends on for cloud, that's a stretch. Dan's calling for a stock price with a five or six in front of it within 12 to 24 months, which is aggressive, but his logic tracks. The broader takeaway is this. The market is pricing software like AI as a threat to these companies. Dan says AI is actually the biggest catalyst they've had in a decade. And the disconnect between those two views is where he thinks the money gets made. Software companies with massive install bases are going to monetize AI through their existing customer relationships. They don't need to win the model race. They just need to plug AI into workflows that millions of people already use every day. That's a different competitive position than building a model from scratch. If you're trying to get up to date with the news but don't understand the terms and importance of AI or want to have a better understanding of AI before you make an investment, I made a course called the AI landscape that breaks all of this down step by step. Links in the description. You get lifetime access and the price will be going up as we add new modules. So Dan's making the case that AI will be a massive tailwind for US software companies. But the next clip raises a much bigger question. What if you don't need to spend hundreds of billions of dollars to get there? American big tech is on track to spend over half a trillion dollars on AI infrastructure this year. China's top companies are spending about $70 billion and they're shipping competitive models that are going global. Same category of AI breakthroughs supposedly completely opposite market reactions. Let's dig into why. >> So here in the US, AI progress it seems to spook the markets while in China they fuel a rally. Now, part of the reason why may be this huge delta in spending. American big tech, it's on track to spend well over half a trillion dollars on the AI buildout this year. That is money coming out of free cash flow and increasingly out of debt. China's top public companies, meanwhile, they're on track to spend just a fraction of that, $70 billion. And yet, they're shipping competitive models and they're going global. The market here is asking a very simple question. What if you don't need to spend that much? Now this bifurcation it's playing out in real time in the public markets. Over the weekend, Bite Dance launched a new AI video generation tool called Seance 2.0. Chinese AI, media, and gaming stocks. They all surged as analysts called it a potential singularity moment for AI in film and TV. But look what happened when something similar here happened. Google released Project Genie about a week ago. This is an AI tool that generates interactive worlds from a prompt. You had Unity, Roblox, Take Two, all falling on that announcement. Same category of AI breakthrough. Completely opposite market reaction. It's not just gaming either. Of course, the entire US software sector is in freef fall. Here in America, AI, it's being treated as a threat. Which incumbent does it kill? While in China, it's being priced as an opportunity. Who benefits next? Now, that gap could widen even further. At least five major model releases are expected before Lunar New Year on February 17th. Every Chinese lab is trying to have its own deepseek moment and at a fraction of the cost. Yesterday guys, I spoke to the data brick CEO Alli Godsy. He said the Chinese models are right behind us and they're basically free and he just raised 7 billion because there were in his words 2000s vibes among top investors here. So guys, even someone at the center of the AI buildout here is bracing for a shakeout. whereas the Chinese companies and the pure plays are going public and raising just tons bucketloads of money. >> I mean, you've talked about this before, but can you just explain why there's such a big gap between the spending in the US and the spending in China if they're able to get models that do similar things? >> So, put simply, American AI is chasing frontier models. So, we are constantly pushing ahead on the capability. So Chinese models, they're not pushing the frontier, but they can catch up with the latest frontier model through more efficient methods. So they're not first, but they get there months and increasingly sometimes just a few weeks later. So if you think about, you know, what's going to dominate among enterprises, among countries that don't necessarily need the frontier models or just something that's good enough, that's where the Chinese edge is. And you can get that by less spending. America and Chinese AI markets are pricing the same technology through completely different lenses. Threat versus opportunity. And that gap is creating real distortions on both sides. So the spending gap is wild. US big tech over half a trillion dollars. China's top companies around 70 billion. And the Chinese models are genuinely competitive, though not matching Frontier performance, but they're getting close enough for most enterprise use cases at the point where the difference isn't as important. Bite Dance drops an AI video tool and Chinese media stock search. Google drops a similar tool and US gaming stocks fall. Same type of breakthrough, opposite reaction. The American market treats every AI advancement as a question of who gets disrupted. The Chinese market treats it as a question of who benefits next. And the efficiency argument is real. Chinese labs are catching up with Frontier models. Some saying they are within weeks or months now. And they're doing it at a fraction of the cost. The Data Brick CEO said it himself. Chinese models are right behind us and they're basically free. And he just raised $7 billion because there were, in his word, 2,000 vibes among top investors. So even people at the center of the US AI buildout are sensing that the spending math might not work for everyone. When you're spending seven times more than your competitor and they're delivering 90% of the capability, the market starts asking hard questions about returns. Now there's a counterargument and it's important. China's compute infrastructure is structurally limited. TSMC outproduced China's leading chip fab by more than 30 times. Chinese chips still lag Nvidia on performance and efficiency. Huawwise chips reportedly cause delays in Deep Seek's next model. So Frontier AI, the absolute cutting edge, still requires hardware that China can't produce domestically. American companies pushing the boundary of what's possible have a real advantage there. The question is how much of the market actually needs frontier performance versus good enough. I think the real insight is that both markets might be overreacting in opposite directions. China's rally could be underpricing the compute constraints that will eventually slow them down and the US selloff could be overpricing the disruption risk to incumbent software companies which circles back to Dan's point from the first clip. The truth is probably somewhere in the middle. American AI spending is building real infrastructure with real demand behind it. every GPU getting deployed is being used. But the Chinese approach is proving that you can get impressive results with much less capital and that changes the math on what returns investors should expect from all that US spending. Now, let's watch this debate over what Open AI needs to do to get back to the pole position of AI. >> You're upgrading your view on Open AI and its orbit. In plain English, explain why Gil and why public market investors who are listening right Gil, why should they care? Well, yes, this really is about open AI. And if you've looked at the stocks for the last six months, what you've seen is that the market has decided that Google is the only winner and then the whole open AI complex, Orbit is lost, right? So that's why Google has outperformed Microsoft, Nvidia, Oracle so much over the last six months. What we're arguing is that Google is a winner, but the race is not over. And while OpenAI was meandering a little bit a few months ago, they are now far more focused on what they should be, which is chat GPT and good frontier models. They're also now scared their investors into a very large round. Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia don't want Google to win. They don't want Google to run away with AI. So, they're now going to fund OpenAI with another hundred billion dollars on top of the 40 billion Open Air already has. So, OpenAI will have time. It will have the capital to spend on more compute, ramp revenue, and the last thing we expect from OpenAI is that over the next few days or weeks, they're going to introduce a new model that's going to be state-of-the-art. So it'll be better than Google's. So this whole story and narrative that Google has already won is going to be harder to tell when the best model is actually an open AI model. >> When you say the public Yeah. When you say state-of-the-art there, Gil, I'm just curious. Better than Google. How are you judging that, Gil? By by what variables? By what metrics? >> Well, we we benchmark it internally. My colleague Alex Platt looks at the public benchmarks and then he also runs the models to see how they compare and and so he has an up-to-date benchmark on that and he expects that the next model from OpenAI is going to be top of the rankings for that based on external uh benchmarks as well as his benchmark and then the publicly traded companies are the important ones right now since OpenAI isn't public we're talking talking primarily about Microsoft and Nvidia that are going to revert in terms of their stock performance. When that happens, when open air has the capital and has the best model, they should revert to the mean with Google which is right now trading at a far higher multiple compared to Microsoft and Nvidia and compared to its historical multiple trading range. >> What about those Gil who say I'm interested to get your take on this and we've had tech analysts on the show. They look at Google and they say, \"Gil, Sunder Pichai, he he just has certain advantages over Alman. He's got that full stack. He's got the chips. He's got the cloud business. He's got the distribution.\" What do you say to that? >> That that's all true, which is why Google should be a winner. But if you look at a little deeper than that, Chad GPT has three times as many users as Gemini and Anthropic is leading in the enterprise. Google Cloud just accelerated to 48% but it's still smaller than Azure and AWS and their ad business is growing slower than Meta's. So yeah, Google's a winner. They have a lot of structural advantages here, but they're not the only winner and they're unlikely to be the only winner, especially if Amazon, Microsoft, and Nvidia gang up to support open AI and anthropic. So the the open AI story you're telling here, Gil, which is as always, you make a compelling case. What what are the what are the risks for Open AI though as you were writing this note and talking to your clients? What what could go wrong for Sam Alman's company? >> So the first thing was what was going wrong last year, which is they started to spread themselves too thin. If they go back to that, we would be concerned. Let's not forget open eye went from having a good frontier model in chat GPT to wanting to build their own chips and build their own data centers and have hardware and and get into enterprise software and all these things that are superfluous and it's not well positioned to do what we've seen them is come back to focusing on the frontier model and and Chad GPT if they revert back to spending capital on things they shouldn't be in we'd be concerned and then the other thing is you can't count the chickens till they hatch until they actually have the hundred billion in the bank from Microsoft, Amazon, and Nvidia. It's not a done deal yet. So, we're going to be waiting to see that happen hopefully by the end of March. >> YouTube isn't just entertainment.
