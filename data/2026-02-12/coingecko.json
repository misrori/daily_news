        "transcript": "How much attention do you pay to a token's unlock schedule before buying or selling it? Because according to a major study by Krock, you probably should be paying a lot more attention. Over $600 million worth of tokens unlock every week and 90% of those events lead to negative price pressure. [music] So, if you trade or invest without checking the unlock schedule, there's a good chance this will change how you think about it. Before we dive into the details, here's a quick overview of what the report looked at. K-Rock broke down token unlocks into three main angles. First, they studied how prices move before and after unlocks. After analyzing over 16,000 events, they tracked how early price drops start and how long it takes for things to stabilize afterwards. Second, they looked at how the size and structure of an unlock affects price behavior. This includes a comparison between large one-time releases and gradual distributions over time. And then third, they analyzed how the type of recipient impacts price. [music] They compared unlocks that go to teams, investors, communities, or ecosystem funds, and found meaningful differences in how the market reacts depending on who's getting the tokens. So, with that context in [music] mind, let's walk through some of the most notable findings, starting with the moment unlocks actually start to affect price. According to the data, it doesn't all happen on the unlock day. prices tend to start slipping about 30 days before the event with the pressure intensifying closer to the release. [music] So why is that? Well, Krock points to two forces at play. Large holders like funds often start hedging weeks in advance to reduce risk and retail traders who spot the unlock coming often sell early to frontr run the drop. So by the time the tokens are actually released, much of the selling has already been set in motion. The unlock day still brings a spike in volatility and often a sharper drop. But interestingly, the report found that prices tend to stabilize fairly quickly, usually within 2 weeks. So based on that pattern, Krock suggests exiting positions roughly 30 days before a major unlock and re-entering about 14 days after once the market has had time to settle. Now, Krock also analyzed how the size of an unlock affects price. As you would expect, bigger unlocks tend to lead to bigger price drops. They grouped events by how much of the total supply was released from nano ones that released less than 0.1% of the total supply all the way up to huge unlocks of more than 10%. [music] Now, the most severe reactions came from unlocks in the 5 [music] to 10% range. Those caused prize drops about two times worse than smaller ones. But oddly enough, the biggest unlock events, the ones over 10%, didn't always perform the worst. Sometimes they cause less immediate damage than those midsize 5 to 10% drops. So Krock explains that when an unlock is that massive, it's almost impossible to dump it all at once or fully hedge it. So their impact is spread out over a longer period instead of showing up as a sudden crash. Krock also looked at the structure of the unlock where they investigated the difference in price impact between cliff unlocks and linear vesting. So a cliff is when a big chunk of tokens gets released all at once after a lockup period while linear vesting means tokens are released gradually over time. So the report found that cliffs tend to hit the price harder. That sudden spike in circulating supply is tough for the market to digest. So the reaction is usually sharp. Now with linear unlocks, the supply trickles in at a steady [music] pace. So the market has more time to adjust, meaning less of a shock in the short term. But that doesn't always mean the price holds up better in the long run. Kirock notes that when small unlocks keep happening backtoback like in long monthly vesting schedules, they can still create persistent downward pressure. The price might not crash, but it struggles to build any [music] upward momentum. They also pointed out an interesting pattern in hybrid structures where a large cliff is followed by linear investing. In many of those cases, the price drop from the cliff tends to recover after about a month. But if after that it's just constant small unlocks with no breaks, the market can stay suppressed for much longer. For these unlocks, they suggest waiting until [music] they're completed. And if that timeline isn't feasible, looking at who the recipient is may provide a better indicator of impact. [music] And that brings us to the last part of the analysis. who is receiving the unlocked tokens and how that changes the way the market reacts. So they grouped recipients into four main categories. Investors, team members, community related like airdrops and ecosystem funds. Now almost all types showed a negative price impact to some extent, but the scale of that impact varied a lot. Team unlocks were the worst by far. On average, these trigger drawdowns of around 25% and that decline often began over 30 days before the unlock. Krock points out that team members typically don't hedge or coordinate sales. And these tokens are often part of their compensation, and when they finally unlock, many just cash out. Now, not all at once, but in this steady, [music] unstructured way that weighs heavily on the market. They point to Apecoin as a case in point. Starting in March 2023, Ape began unlocking about $11 million a month to the Yugalabs team, roughly 0.7% of supply. Not a massive number on its own, but over the next 7 months, Ape's price dropped 77% while ETH was only down 9%. Steady team selling and fading interest dragged [music] the token down. Investor unlocks, on the other hand, were surprisingly tame. Krock looked at over 100 of them and found that price reactions were mild. That's because most funds and early investors manage their exits carefully. They hedge in advance, sell through over-the-counter deals, or use market makers to avoid spooking the market. Community related unlocks such as airdrops had mixed results. Some people dump the tokens as soon as they get them, but many just hold either out of loyalty or inertia. And that balance means the price impact is usually moderate. Krock described it as tepid. A mild dip before and after, but nothing dramatic. Ecosystem unlocks were the outliers. These are tokens set aside for developer grants, liquidity incentives, and growth programs. On average, they actually had a small positive impact on price because the tokens are being used to strengthen the project, not dumped on the market, providing liquidity, funding infrastructure, rewarding users. These all create activity, which helps absorb the new supply. So, they highlighted optimism as an example. In June 2022, the project unlocked about 3% of its supply for a governance fund. After a short dip, the team distributed 36 million OP tokens across 24 ecosystem projects, which boosted adoption and liquidity and helped push OP's price upward. [music] So, what does this all mean? If there's one takeaway from the Key Rock report, it's that token unlocks are far from neutral events. In many cases, they're one of the most predictable sources of selling pressure in the market. That's why checking unlock schedules before taking a position makes a lot of sense. So look at when the next unlock is, how big it is, and also who is getting the tokens. That alone can help you avoid unnecessary pain or time a re-entry more effectively. And also it doesn't take much effort. Platforms like Coin Gecko publish token unlock schedules for most major projects. So, let us know. Is checking unlock schedules already part of your trading routine, or is this the first time that you're really thinking about it? [music]",
        "summary_hu": "A tokenek feloldásának időpontja jelentős hatással van a kriptopiacok áralakulására. A Krock által végzett tanulmány több mint 16,000 esemény elemzésével megállapította, hogy a feloldások 90%-a negatív árat idéz elő. A legnagyobb hatás a 5-10%-os feloldásoknál észlelhető, míg a 10%-ot meghaladó feloldások nem mindig okoznak meredek áresést. A csúcsokat követően a piac általában gyorsan stabilizálódik, javasolt a pozíciók eladása körülbelül 30 nappal a feloldás előtt. Az is fontos, hogy a feloldott tokeneket kik kapják, mivel a csapatoknak eladniuk kell a javadalmazásukat, ami korai eladásokat generálhat. A közösségi kapcsolódású feloldások mérsékelt hatást gyakorolnak, míg az ökoszisztéma feloldások pozitív hatást gyakorolhatnak a projektekre.",

The largest price drops are observed with unlocks in the 5-10% range, while those over 10% do not necessarily lead to the worst outcomes. Prices tend to stabilize quickly post-unlock, suggesting a strategy of exiting positions approximately 30 days prior to an unlock. The type of recipients also matters; team members often sell their tokens upon unlock, creating market pressure, while community-related unlocks show a more moderate impact. Ecosystem unlocks can even have a positive effect by supporting project growth.",
