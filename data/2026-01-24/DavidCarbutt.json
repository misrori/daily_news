        "transcript": "Elon Musk just dropped some insane predictions in one of the best interviews he's given in recent times. I've collected the three best clips from it and I'll tell you why this conversation here is such a big deal. Firstly, my third favorite clip. Check this out. >> So, I know you are you're going to be having a couple big announcements on robotics and what it can do. I mean, when I went to the factory, you showed me those robots. >> Yeah. Um, how quickly you talked about the billions of robots, but how quickly and how quickly can they be deployed in a manufacturing setting? How quickly can they be utilized and be functional and be uh create that that abundance that you talked about? >> Well, humanoid robotics will advance very quickly. I think uh we we we do have some of the Tesla Octopus robots doing simple tasks in the factory. Um we except probably later this year. By the end of this year, I think they'll be doing um more more complex tasks and but still deployed in an industrial environment and uh and probably sometime next year by the end of next year I I think uh we'll be selling humanoid robots uh to the public. Um that that's when we are confident that the it's very high reliability, very high safety. Um and the range of functionality is uh is is also very high. You can basically ask it to do anything you'd like. But you're already seeing that in Tesla cars. This the software changes. You're doing it what is it every quarter now? A software change that upgrades the the ability of a robot within the car. >> Uh yes, the Tesla full self-driving software we update it sometimes once a week. Um and um recently some of the insurance companies have said that uh it is actually so safe uh where what Tesla full full self-driving is so safe that uh they're they're offering uh customers half price insurance if they if they use Tesla full self-driving in their car >> and that should be monitored by the insurance company. Can they is that part of the agreement then? >> Yeah. Um but I I think uh self-driving cars is essentially a solved problem at this point, >> right? >> Um Tesla's rolled out sort of robo taxi service in a few cities and >> right >> will uh I be very very widespread by the end of this year within the US and then we we hope to get supervised full self-driving approval in Europe hopefully next month. really that quickly. >> Yeah. And then uh maybe a similar timing timing for China hopefully. >> Teslas are building the feedback loop that lets robots and cars learn from each other and that's why their timeline sounds aggressive but might actually be conservative. AI is really kicking off here in 2026. If you're a beginner and you wish you could get up to speed with it, I built the course I wish I had when I first started deep diving AI. There's a link in the description to lifetime access to the course. The price will be going up as we add new modules and we're thinking of doing that soon. Back to the video. So, look, when Elon says Optimus will be doing complex factory tasks by the end of the year and selling to the public by the end of the next year, it does sound a bit crazy until you understand what Tesla already has. They're not starting from scratch. That's the thing here. They've got a manufacturing operation that builds nearly 2 million vehicles a year, which means they already produce and know how to massproduce motors, batteries, actuators, and all of the mechanical stuff that is needed to go into a humanoid robot. And on top of that, they've got all this AI training infrastructure from FSD that's been learning from billions of real world miles. The robot brain and the car brain aren't that different when you think about it. both need to understand the physical world, navigate around obstacles, and make realtime decisions. The insurance point is actually huge, and I don't think people are connecting the dots here. Lemonade is offering halfpric insurance rates if you drive using Tesla's full self-driving. That means the actuarial data, the actual accident rates, is showing that FSD is significantly safer than humans, and a third-party company is willing to put their neck on the lines to ensure it at half price. And this is happening while it's still supervisor mode only where a driver has to pay attention. Think about what that data looks like once a system gets even better. The cost of operating a Tesla keeps dropping because insurance is a meaningful chunk of what you pay annually to own and drive a car. Although we might be seeing FSD subscription rates increase as functionality does as well. And then there's the regulatory piece. Elon saying supervised FSD could get approved in Europe and possibly China next month. That's not some distance goal. That's weeks away. Tesla's already logged over a million km of testing across many European countries. The mayor of Rome personally rode in FSD and was shocked by how well it drove. Autobuild, which is basically Europe's toughest car magazine, did 700 km in Berlin with zero critical interventions. Once one European country cracks, the others will likely follow. In my opinion, the Robo Taxi piece ties it all together. Tesla's already registered over 1,200 vehicles and more than 600 drivers in California for their ride hailing service, up from basically nothing a few months ago. And when San Francisco had that major power outage recently, Whimo cars just stopped dead in the streets whilst Teslas kept driving. That's what happens when you train on billions of realworld miles, including edge case cases like blackouts. Your system can handle things that competitors haven't even thought of yet. The gap between Tesla and everyone else on real world driving data is measured in billions of miles and it grows every single day. But here's where I think it gets super interesting. All of this AI training requires massive amounts of compute and Elon thinks he found a way to scale that infinitely. This next clip, my second favorite clip from this view, explains why SpaceX achieving full rocket reusability changes everything. Not just for going to Mars, but also for building AI infrastructure that can scale without limits in space. Economics Elon's describing would make space-based computing cheaper than anything on Earth within a few years. Check this bad boy out. >> I want to move to space cuz historically space is very capital inensive. Historically been done by governments. Obviously SpaceX changed the whole model. Uh but we've seen it slow to scale and now I'm starting to see it ramping up and what you're doing and other things. Um talk to us about the res, you know, the automation and AI how it's changing the economics in building uh and preparing for us in operating in space. >> Uh sure. Um well the key breakthrough that tells that's right the major breakthrough that SpaceX is hoping to achieve this year is full reusability. Um so no one has ever achieved full reusability of a rocket which is very important for the cost of access to space. Um we've achieved partial reusability with Falcon 9 by landing the boost stage. We we've now landed the boost stage over 500 times. Um but uh we we have to throw away the upper stage. The upper stage burns up on re-entry for Falcon 9. So, and that that the cost of that is equivalent to a small to mediumsiz jet with Starship, which is a giant rocket. It's it's the largest flying machine ever made. >> That's a rocket that you using for the idea of going to Mars, right? >> Yeah. Mars and the moon. Um, as well as for high volume satellite stuff. So, Starship um hopefully this year we should prove full reusability for Starship which will be um a profound invention uh because uh the cost of access to space will drop by a factor of 100 when you achieve full reusability. Um, >> right. >> It's it's the same sort of economic difference that you would expect that uh between say a reusable aircraft and a non-reusable aircraft. Like if you have to throw your aircraft away after every flight, that would be a very expensive flight. Um, but if you only have to refuel, uh, then it's the cost of the fuel. And so that's really the uh the the fundamental breakthrough that gets the cost of access to space uh we think uh below the cost of uh of freight on aircraft under $100 a pound type of thing easily. Um so it it it makes uh putting large satellites into into space very low very very cheap. Um, and then when you have solar in space, you you get uh five times more effectiveness, maybe even more than that, than solar on the ground >> because it's it's always sunny. >> It's cold and >> it Yeah, it's it's it's always well, it's always sunny, so you don't have a dayight cycle or seasonality, right, >> or weather. Um, and you get about uh 30% more power in space uh because uh you don't have atmospheric attenuation of the power, >> right? the the net effect is solar is five times more uh any given solar panel will do five times more uh energy in space than uh on the ground. >> Is there any capacity in doing that and and then taking that power and bringing it back to earth? Is there any way of doing that or or you just taking that power and utilizing it for the needs like building AI data centers in its face? I >> I I think the the case it's it's a no-brainer for building a uh AI solar powered AI data centers in space um because as you mentioned it's it's also very cold in space if you're if you're if you're in the shadow uh that it's it's very cold in space just 3° Kelvin so you just have your solar panels facing the sun and then uh a uh radiator that's like point like pointed away from the sun um so it has no sun incidence and then it's and then it's just cooling it's a very efficient cooling system net effect is that the lowest cost place to put AI will be space and that and that'll be true within 2 years maybe three three at the latest. >> Wow. SpaceX proving full reusability drops the cost of getting stuff to orbit by 100x and that unlocks AI data centers in space as the lowest cost option for compute within 2 to 3 years. So nobody has ever made a fully reusable orbital rocket. The space shuttle had to go through 9 months of repairs after every flight. That's not reusable in any practical sense. SpaceX has landed the Falcon 9 booster hundreds of times now, but they still throw away the upper stage, which costs about as much as a small jet every single launch. With Starship, if they reuse both the booster and the ship, the economics completely flip. Elon's saying the cost of getting stuff to orbit drops to under 100 bucks a pound. Right now, it's thousands. And the math unlocks something that sounds like science fiction, but actually makes total sense when you think about it. Running AI data centers requires three things: chips, power, and cooling. On Earth, you need to buy land, get permits, build massive cooling systems, and find enough electricity, which is becoming a real constraint as AI training runs get bigger. In space, solar panels produce five times more energy because there's no atmosphere, no weather, no night cycle if you position the satellite right. Cooling is basically free because you just radiate heat into the void of the dark side of the satellite. And you don't need batteries because the sun never sets. The numbers that people are throwing around here are wild. SpaceX is apparently planning to build three Starships a day. If those are fully reusable and you fly each one once a week, you're talking about capacity to launch maybe a 100 gawatts worth of AI compute into orbit within a few years. For context, the biggest data centers on Earth right now are around 1 gawatt and cost something like $50 billion. The bottleneck for this is the physical infrastructure to power and cool the chips. Space removes that bottleneck entirely. And think about who benefits from this. SpaceX launches the satellites. Tesla makes the chips. Elon said on record he thinks Tesla will produce more AI chips than everyone else combined eventually. XAI builds the model that runs on the compute. The solar panels could come from Tesla energy. These companies aren't separate bets anymore. They're becoming part of an integrated system where each one feeds into the other. SpaceX is also apparently IPOing in 2026 at somewhere between an 800 billion and a $ 1.5 trillion valuation and maybe raising up to 100 billion in capital. That capital is for building out this infrastructure. When Elon says data centers in space within 2 to 3 years, I don't think he's speculating. I think he's describing a road map that he's already planned. Now, the final and my favorite Elon clip where he explains what the future will look like in the next 5 to 10 years. Check this out. >> So, looking 10 or 20 years out, um what would how would you describe success with AI or space technology and where do you see it? Is that can you are you more certain what's going to happen the next three years or or five or 10? I don't know what's going to happen in 10 years, but the rate at which AI is progressing, we might have AI that is smarter than any human by the end of this year. Um, and and I would say no later than next year. Um, and then probably by 2030 or 2031, call it 5 years from now, uh, AI will be smarter than, uh, all of humanity collectively. >> Picture this.
