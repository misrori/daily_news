    "transcript": "We're  pressing  the  button.  Oh  yes.  Oh   yes.  Oh  yes.  Oh  yes.  Guys,  welcome  to   another  episode.  And  as  you  can  see   right  now,  Bitcoin  is  at  67.  And  we   discussed  during  the  last  few  days  that   potentially  Bitcoin  will  have  a  bit  of  a   pump  because  normally  you  see  that   within  the  uh  time  frame  of  uh  March,   late  February,  March,  Bitcoin  does  start   a  bit  of  a  relief  rally  in  the  midterm   years.  And  we  are  currently  in  such  a   year.  Bitcoin  currently  though  hasn't   really  uh  followed  through.  We  do  see   Bitcoin  being  sideways  and  it's  kind  of   the  same  as  last  week,  the  week  before   that.  One  positive  sign  is  the  shape  of   this  collapse  right  here.  This  is   actually  a  bullish  collapse.  Okay,  so   for  bulls  who  want  instant  pump,  you   want  to  see  something  like  this.  When   it's  dying  off,  but  it's  not  dumping  too   much,  but  still  down.  This  is  actually   bullish.  This  is  in  contrast  to  this.   This  is  bearish.  When  it's  upwards  like   this  in  a  consolidation,  it's  not  good.   You  want  to  see  it  kind  of  die  off  like   this.  And  it's  similar  to  kind  of  what   we  saw  here.  Uh  here  it  was  also  kind  of   like  dying  off  like  this  and  then  boop   could  recover.  And  this  was  also  similar   if  we  go  back  all  the  way  to  the   previous  bull  market.  You  see  here  it   was  like  this.  It  was  actually  very   good.  And  u  this  in  contrast  it's  in   contrast  to  yeah  something  like  we  saw   right  here.  So  downward  sloping  dump   like  this  is  actually  good.  But  uh   currently  we  don't  see  any   followthrough.  I  still  expect  us  to  have   some  kind  of  rift  rally  at  some  point.   It's  going  to  be  very  very  likely  a   lower  high  maybe  to  80k  like  we   discussed  yesterday,  but  potentially   it's  even  going  to  get  rejected  here  by   se  by  74  if  it  ever  starts.  Uh  but  the   question  everyone  has  currently  is  why   are  bulls  so  slow?  Why  don't  we  see  any   pump?  And  the  answer  is  that  likely  the   pump  will  still  happen.  I'm  still   betting  on  a  relief  rally.  I  mean  number   one  because  the  geometry  of  the   consolidation  is  like  this  like  I've   been  telling  you.  So  that  actually   points  more  to  that  we  may  see  a  pump   here  according  to  schedule  uh  in  March.   But  if  we  don't  guys  we  also  don't   really  care.  I  mean  our  long-term  uh   long-term  buy  uh  buy  zone  is  right  below   us  here.  So  even  if  we  don't  see  some   kind  of  relief  rally  we  don't  really   care  either.  So  for  us  it's  potato   potato  tomato  tomato  is  the  best.  I  mean   we  are  in  the  best  possible  position   where  if  it  happens  it  happens  it   doesn't  happen  and  no  one  cares.  Okay.   And  if  it  happens  it's  just  more   shorting  opportunities.  Uh  if  we  get   let's  say  to  the  uh  the  74k   it  would  be  an  interesting  short  to  open   if  it  starts  to  break  down.  And  if  it   goes  to  80  is  also  an  interesting  short   if  it  if  it  starts  to  uh  to  dump  here.   And  the  80  level  here  it  is  based  on  how   much  we  normally  pump  in  midterm  year.   You  see  here  this  this  white  white  one   is  the  average  of  the  midterm  years.  If   you  look  at  this  pump  and  you  see  on   average  how  big  it  is,  this  would  take   us  from  currently  67  to  approximately   80.  So  those  are  the  scenarios  but  the   big  picture  guys  is  still  that  we're  in   bare  trend.  We're  in  bare  trend  and  the   path  of  least  resistance  is  down  and  uh   crypto  as  a  whole  is  going  to  be  so  so   important  to  own  in  the  near  future.  So,   as  we  get  into  the  the  buy  zone,  guys,   buying  assets  is  going  to  be  so   important  both  when  it  comes  to  crypto,   but  assets  overall,  they're  going  to  be   so  important.  And  that's  why  when  people   get  so  bearish  on  Bitcoin,  I  I  see   people  saying  that  that  we're  going  to   have  now  several  years  of  bare  market  or   that  we're  going  to  go  to  30  or   something  like  that.  30K  for  Bitcoin.  We   may  go  to  30  for  Salana,  but  for   Bitcoin,  30K,  it's  too  low.  So,  the  more   the  more  we  progress  into  the  bare,  the   more  we  get  into  the  buy  zones,  the  more   you're  going  to  hear  that  crypto  is   dead.  Some  guy  in  the  chat  is  saying   crypto  is  done  and  that's  when  you  know   it's  it's  time  to  buy.  But  let  me  also   show  you  why  it's  so  important  to  have   crypto,  so  important  to  have  assets   because  the  AI  replacement  is  happening   now  in  a  big  way  and  it  has  become  very   very  clear  and  practical  for  everyone   because  before  it  was  a  lot  of  you  know   maybe  AI  is  going  to  replace  maybe  this   maybe  that  but  now  you  see  it  in   practice  actually  um  unfold  in  front  of   our  eyes.  You  have  Jack  who  is  the   former  CEO  of  Twitter  as  you  know  now  he   is  running  uh  block  which  is  a  payment   app  but  basically  he  just  cut  4,000   4,000  people  from  his  company  okay  and   it's  not  because  they  are  struggling  it   is  because  they're  using  AI  okay  they're   using  AI  that's  brutal  imagine  40%  cut   because  of  AI  and  these  are  so-called   white  collar  they  are  educated  they  have   uh  maybe  computer  science  degree,  maybe   they  have  something  else,  but  uh  they're   not  safe.  They're  not  safe.  And  he's   he's  writing,  \"We're  see  we're  already   seeing  what  the  intelligence  tools  we're   creating  and  using  paired  with  smaller   and  flatter  teams  are  enabling  us  to  do,   basically  enabling  a  new  way  of  working,   which  fundamentally  changes  what  it   means  to  build  and  run  a  company  and   thus  accelerating  rapidly.\"  Okay,  he   probably  used  uh  Claude  or  or  Grock  to   write  this.  I  saw  this  uh  picture  right   here.  Claude,  fire  40%  of  my  employees   don't  use  any  capital  letters.  Exactly.   No  capital  letters  used.  Everything   lower  case.  That's  an  interesting  choice   of  um  of  words.  And  he's  saying,  \"Yeah,   uh  Kumbaya,  we're  going  to  help  you  guys   find  new  job.\"  But  guys,  how  who  who's   going  to  hire  them?  I  mean,  honestly,   who  who's  gonna  hire  a  lot  of  this   professionals?  Because  the  problem  is   that  you  you  just  need  fewer  people  now.   And  so  when  people  are  saying  that  uh   stock  market  is  going  to  crash  this  and   that  uh  I'm  not  sure  what  they  mean   because  AI  actually  makes  companies  more   valuable  you  see  yourself  if  you  can   remove  40%  of  the  staff  a  lot  of  middle   managers  obviously  for  each  productive   person  you  need  a  few  unproductive  ones   just  you  know  communication  this  and   that  you  remove  40%  you  cut  40%  of  the   fat  it's  very  nice  for  shareholders  it's   also  very  nice  for  stocks  I  mean  the   value  of  the  company  goes  up  if  you  can   achieve  more  with  less  you  do  more  with   less  So  for  company  stock,  this  should   be  fantastic.  And  that's  exactly  what   we're  seeing  in  front  of  us.  As  they   announced  this  layoff,  their  stock  block   pumped  20%.  Okay?  And  of  course,   everyone  is  seeing  that.  All  other  CEOs   on  Wall  Street,  all  other  tech  companies   are  seeing  that  what  the  hell  if  I  fire   40%  of  my  staff  and  then  I  mention  that   AI  is  replacing  them,  uh,  my  stock  is   going  to  pump.  And  obviously  my   compensation  in  many  cases  if  I'm  a  CEO   or  some  kind  of  operator  in  a  company   it's  tied  to  the  stock  to  the  stock   price.  The  higher  I  can  pump  the  stock   the  more  compensation  I  have.  So  guys   this  is  going  to  be  the  beginning  of   mass  mass  mass  mass  mass  big  fat   unemployment  wave  with  white  collar  who   currently  work  in  tech.  There's  going  to   be  affecting  mainly  the  tech  workers   because  they  basically  replace   themselves.  I  mean  that  that  wasn't  what   has  happened  but  it  will  also  within  the   coming  years  propagate  to  other   industries.  Other  industries  are  of   course  slower  to  use  AI,  understand  AI.   But  it's  happening  so  quickly  that  it's   inevitable  within  a  few  years,  you're   going  to  see  the  same  thing  in  other   even  non-  tech  fields  that  whoever  you   are,  if  you're  not  a  senior,  if  you're   not  really  world  class  at  your  job,  if   you're  not  really  giving  everything  you   have  and  you're  really,  you  know,  star   performer,  you're  simply  not  really   needed.  Okay?  Because  whatever  you  do,   likely  someone  else  double  checks  now   and  AI  can  do  the  same  thing  and  someone   else  double  checks  AI.  Uh  because  the   biggest  argument  is  that  oh  no  but  AI  is   unreliable.  Listen  you're  also   unreliable.   So  many  people  are  freaking  unreliable.   So  someone  like  if  you  have  someone   senior  guys  checking  your  work  before  it   goes  to  client  before  it  goes  to  the   delivery  man  I  can  do  the  same  in  many   cases.  You  still  got  to  double  check.  So   why  double  check  you?  You  still  need   vacation.  You  need  over  you  need  bonus   out  of  nowhere  you  ask  for  bonus.  AI   does  not  ask  for.   So  I  I  think  that's  the  number  one  thing   you  can  think  about  like  does  your  boss   have  to  doublech  checkck  you  because  if   they  have  man  they  can  just  get  AI  and   double  check  AI  and  AI  in  many  cases  can   do  many  jobs.  I  mean  people  who  guys   themselves  into  thinking  that  oh  no  I'm   unreplaceable  man  in  many  cases  probably   not  probably  you're  replaceable.  So   let's  see  how  it  will  unfold.  Coming   back  to  this  discussion  about  assets,  it   will  be  very  important  to  own  assets   because  the  gap  between  the  middle  class   and  the  rich  is  going  to  be  widened.   It's  basically  going  to  be  either  you're   rich  or  you're  pleb.  That's  what  that's   what  we're  heading  into.  And  so  if  you   can  get  assets,  if  you  can  cling  on  to   the  asset  explosion  that's  going  to   happen  because  AI  will  be  able  to  do  so   much  automation.  It's  gonna  basically   whoever  owns  AI  will  own  most  of  the   society.  So  you  got  to  cling  you  got  to   cling  to  the  asset  to  the  stone   including  crypto  because  crypto  is  as  an   asset  also  is  going  to  go  up  a  lot.   There  are  some  assets  which  will  be  hurt   a  lot.  Let's  say  uh  corporate  real   estate  uh  is  who  needs  it?  Not  too  many   people  need  it.  You  see  yourself  Jack   Dorsey  just  fired  4,000  people.  It's   4,000  chairs  that  uh  that  don't  need   anyone  to  sit  in.  Okay.  It's  4,000   office  place.  So  you  you  really  got  to   think  in  terms  of  assets  guys.  is  going   to  be  assetbased  economy.  And  also   another  thing  you  got  to  think  about  is   to  structure  your  operations  whether  you   are  investing  yourself  or  your  company   internationally  because  you  see  4,000   people  just  lost  their  job.  Who  they   going  to  go  to?  Mandani,   AOC,  Bernie  Sanders  and  other  lefties  to   give  them  free  money.  Okay?  It's  going   to  be  in  the  US.  It's  going  to  be  in  um   Europe  everywhere.  So  you  need  to  be   with  outside  of  the  blast  radius  of   socialism  that's  going  to  happen  here.   Okay?  Because  the  it's  going  to  be   brutal.  This  socialism  wave  that  is   coming  guys  is  going  to  be  brutal   because  people  who  never  thought  that   they  would  be  on  benefits  are  now  going   to  go  to  benefits.  People  who  never   thought  they  would  be  unemployed  are  now   going  to  go  to  unemployment  queue  very   very  quickly.  And  again  look  at  the   stock  price.  the  stock  price  went  up  20%   when  they  said  that  they're  they  can   fire  50%  of  their  company  basically  uh   with  AI.  Okay,  this  is  a  big  signal  for   everyone  else  to  start  doing  the  same   the  same  if  you  I  mean  let's  say  I  would   have  a  tech  company  on  NASDAQ  man  I  want   a  stock  pump  uh  and  just  so  I  get  a   bonus  that's  the  first  thing  I  would  say   I  would  say  we  have  AI  guys  we  all  of   you  guys  who  are  investors  we  have  AI   and  we  can  probably  fire  a  few  tens  of  a   few  dozens  of  percent  maybe  20%  we  can   maybe  30%  and  uh  we  executed  right   before  my  uh  compensation.  When  is  my   compensation?  I  I  would  look  it  up.  Is   it  in  December?  I  mean,  so  it's  a   basically  approximately  where  my   compensation  is.  Right  around  then  I   would  do  it.  I  get  my  compensation.  Then   we  figure  it  out  with  uh  with  AI.  Let's   see  what's  going  to  happen  now.  Balagi   Balaji.  Balagi  is  saying  this  is  the   first  AI  cut.  First  AI  cut.  And  it  will   send  shock  waves.  Remember  Jack  is  one   of  the  greatest  fun  of  all  time.  He   created  this  platform  that  we're  on   today  and  um  has  been  early  to  many   technological  shifts  and  block  was  doing   very  well  as  a  business.  So  this  company   he  has  payment  company  block  is   fantastic.  So  for  him  to  cut  40%  of   headcount  in  this  way  is  a  signal  to   everyone  in  tech  get  good  now  become   indispensable.  Basically  what  I  just   told  you  now  either  you  are  really   needed  to  the  company  or  you're  not  or   you're  not  work  nights  and  weekends.  And   of  course  I  mean  there's  a  big  question   to  be  asked  for  what  you  know  you  are   born  on  this  field  if  if  you're  thinking   about  philosophy  here  you're  born  uh  on   this  earth  okay  to  do  what  to  do  to  be  a   slave  to  the  tech  CEO  no  so  I  also   understand  that  you  know  many  people   will  say  uh  okay  it  doesn't  make  sense   okay  you'll  have  to  figure  out  something   else  then  but  there  is  an  argument  to  be   make  okay  working  nights  and  weekends  I   mean  for  what  man  for  what  for  for  what   for  salary  because  you're  competing  with   AI  so  the  question  is  do  you  want  to   compete  with  AI  that  that's  a  fair   question  maybe  not  maybe  you  want  to  be   investor  maybe  you  want  to  be  trader   that's  why  for  me  for  example  the  only   exit  here  is  to  be  good  at  financial   markets  because  then  you  have  no  no  boss   if  you  can  trade  you  can  be  worldwide   you  can  be  anywhere  everything  else   you're  competing  with  AI  too  much  so  you   see  my  passion  is  more  towards  markets   markets  markets  markets  markets  markets   markets  that's  it  so  if  you  are  a  tech   worker  your  job  will  become  to  work   nights  and  weekends   uh  learn  the  AI  tools  and  raise  your   game.  Yeah,  maybe  you  can  do  that,  but   it's  a  big  problem  also  philosophically.   You  let's  say  you  have  kids,  you  you   don't  see  your  kids  so  your  CEO  does  not   fire  you  because  of  AI.  I  mean,  it's   it's  it's  a  big  philosophical  question.   So,  my  answer  is  become  good  at  markets.   Go  to  bulmania.com,  learn  how  trading   works.  It's  a  pre-training  and  then   we're  going  to  tell  you  how  to  join   Bulmania,  how  to  get  the  tools,  but  you   see  yourself  what's  happening.  Or  you   might  not  make  the  cut  exactly  as  an   employee  or  as  a  company.  I  know  that   sucks,  but  capitalism  is  natural   selection.  The  market  is  unforgiving   because  you  are  the  market.  After  all,   it's  not  like  you're  buying  some  random   gallon  of  milk  from  the  store.  You're   always  buying  the  best  product  at  the   best  price.  So  too  for  apps.  Your   customers  are  always  installing  the  best   piece  of  code  they  can  get.  And  because   AI  AI  is  creating  and  because  AI  and   because  AI  is  going  to  create  new   winners,  if  you  aren't  the  best  in  the   market,  someone  may  become  better  with   AI.  And  guys,  by  the  way,  here  is  where   we're  going  to  see  so  many  layoffs  uh   due  to  the  fact  that  the  old  companies,   they're  not  really  structured  for  AI.   They  have  to  hire  too  many.  They've   hired  too  many.  They  have  built  their   teams  wrong.  Uh  well,  not  wrong  five   years  ago,  but  today  wrong.  So,  they   will  have  to  reconfigure  everything  just   like  Jack  Dorsey  is  doing  now.  the  fact   that  you  have  a  traditional  scrum  team   with  product  manager  with  designer  with   back  end  and  front  end  and  they're  all   bickering  and  you  know  the  design  guy  is   preaching  about  design  best  practice   front  end  guy  is  he  wants  his  own  best   practice  he's  preaching  about  the   antiatterns  antiatterns  that  we're  in   producing  the  back  end  guy  needs  to  redo   the  API  five  times  because  front  end   does  not  like  it  because  of  anti-attern   As  you  can  see,  I've  been  in  a  few  scrum   teams,  guys.  I've  been  in  a  few  scrum   teams.  They  is  going  to  be  reimagined.   Like  all  of  this,  we  need  to  start  from   scratch.  We  need  to  start  from  scratch.   Maybe  where  the  the  CEO  or  product   manager  can  do  most  of  the  job  with  AI   tools  and  then  you  have  some  senior  guy   just  making  it  production  ready.  I  mean,   let's  see  guys,  it's  going  to  be   interesting,  but  uh  I  think  that  you  you   can  probably  cut  50%  just  like  Jack   Dorsey  is  doing  now.  So,  what  is  the  uh   what  is  the  action?  The  action  that   everyone  has  to  take  is  to  become  good   at  markets.  Otherwise,  you're  cooked.   You're  cooked.  You  see  what's  happening?   You're  going  to  be  cooked.  You  need  to   be  your  own  boss  as  much  as  possible.   And  being  a  trader,  being  an  investor  is   the  best  way.  Otherwise,  you're  always   in  this  rat  race.  Always  in  this  rat   race.  Even  if  you  have  a  company,  man,   let's  say  you  build  some  kind  of   startup,  you're  always  also  in  the  rat   race.  You're  also  in  the  rat  race  with   AI.  So,  I'm  telling  you,  stop  the  rat   race.  Don't  lick  ass  with  your  uh  boss   so  that  he  doesn't  replace  you  with  AI.   It's  impossible.  Like  you  cannot  do  so   much  licking.   AI  is  too  fast,  man.  It's  It  doesn't   matter  if  you  laugh  at  his  jokes  at   dinner  or  at  lunch.  You  know,  you  try  to   be  his  friend  laughing  at  you.  You   cannot  uh  outrun  a  guy.  Go  to   bullmania.com,  learn  trading,  learn   investing  properly.  It's  a  free   training.  Then  we  tell  you  how  to  join   our  program.  you  you  jump  on  a  call  with   us  so  we  can  teach  you  uh  trading  so  you   can  you  can  remove  yourself  out  of  the   rat  race.  Now  let's  say  you  have  a   company  it's  the  same  thing  it's  going   to  be  very  hard  for  you  to  uh  to  please   your  client  with  the  with  the  AI  with   the  rise  of  AI.  Of  course  you  can  try  to   use  AI  but  then  you're  at  the  mercy  of   Google  Claude  and  everyone  else  to  just   implement  AI.  I  see  startups  writing  on   Twitter  every  day  that  uh  oh  claude  just   added  my  startup  natively  to  their  to   their  website  to  their  AI  offering  or   Google  just  added  my  startup  feature  to   their  to  their  AI  offering.  as  a  startup   you're  also  in  a  very  bad  position  man   you  would  you're  in  such  bad  position   and  then  people  are  asking  me  hey  Aan   why  you're  so  excited  for  the  layoff  now   guys  I  need  to  tell  you  that  on  a   personal  level  of  course  I  feel  with   everyone  being  laid  off  you  have   mortgage  you  have  kids  like  I  understand   that  on  a  personal  level  I'm  very   compassionate  I'm  very  compassionate  but   I  also  cannot  hide  my  excitement  from   the  fact  that  this  will  lead  to   fantastic  returns  if  you  are  an  investor   and  actually  many  companies  are   mispriced  right  Now  everyone  is  dumping   tech  now  because  they  think  that  AI  is   going  to  kill  them  and  some  of  some  of   them  will  be  removed.  But  listen,  you're   not  going  to  remove  Salesforce  or   Microsoft  or  anyone  else  with  AI.  It's   impossible.  Instead,  Salesforce  and   Microsoft  and  other  uh  stocks,  other   companies,  they  can  fire  50%  of   employees  and  become  even  more   productive.  And  um  so  from  that   perspective,  if  you  are  an  investor,  you   love  AI,  you  love  all  of  these   efficiencies.  But  of  course,  on  a   personal  level,  it's  going  to  be  tough,   man.  I  mean  everyone  will  have  to  become   a  plumber.  Okay.  I  think  if  you're  not   an  investor,  you  have  to  be  plumber.  If   you're  not  in  Bulmania,  sooner  or  later   plumbing  is  going  to  come  for  you   because  that's  a  need  which  is  going  to   take  too  much  time  to  replace  still  with   AI.  Uh  Optimus,  I  I  I  I  don't  see  him  u   I  don't  see  robot  Optimus  here  fixing   the  pipe  or  or  you  know  all  of  this  uh   physical  blue  collar  is  either  blue   collar  or  you  are  wrecked  or  you're  you   maybe  you  go  you  join  the  socialist   party.  But  guys,  the  reason  why  also  let   me  uh  continue  my  monologue  here  a  bit.   The  reason  why  I'm  actually  a  bit   worried  when  it  comes  to  the  uh  to  the   political  side  is  because  you  have  such   a  technological  shift  now.  Holy  crap.  It   is  going  to  lead  to  unrest,  to  populism,   to  dictatorship,  to  communism,  maybe  to   other  ide  ideologies  just  like  the   industrial  revolution  also  led  to   communism,  to  fascism  because  you  have   new  structures,  new  tech,  new  structures   in  societies  with  the  boss  abusing  his   uh  worker.  So  you  have  rights  of   communism  and  now  with  AI,  with  new   tech,  let's  see  what's  going  to  happen.   But  uh  you  see  new  tech  always  creates   turmoil.  Big  turmoil.  Techn   technological  revolutions  create  big   turmoil  politically  because  we  as   monkeys  that  just  came  from  the  tree  not   that  long  ago.  We  were  too  slow  dealing   with  it.  You  know  we  need  to  we  need  to   reconfigure  so  much  and  many  people   going  to  get  financially  uh  devastated   that  they  will  they  will  yeah  they  will   create  chaos  guys.  Okay.  Very  important.   Plumbers  super  cycle.  Exactly.  Matt   plump  mania.   By  the  way,  if  you  are  a  plumber,  u   let's  say  you  are  an  experienced  one,   you  can  make  a  lot  of  money  educating   blue  collar.  I  think  there's  going  to  be   a  lot  of  money  made  taking  those  white   collar  guys  who  drink  lot  matcha  matcha   latt  every  day  and  uh  teaching  them  how   to  fix  roof.  But  I  think  it's  going  to   these  richers  are  going  to  be  made  just   reskilling  the  the  softest  sitting  in   the  office  with  their  uh  very  very  you   know  um  taken  care  of  hands  and  they  and   then  they  need  to  be  physical  be   physical  lift  stuff  clean  the  roof.  It's   going  to  get  crazy  guys.  Let  me  know   whether  you  agree  or  disagree.  A  bit   different  uh  uh  stream  today  but  I   thought  it's  so  important  like  this  it's   quite  this  is  crazy  guys.  I  mean  it's   it's  just  going  to  continue.

And   on  this  note,  welcome  everyone  who's   watching  live.  Big  shout  out  to  who?  To   Guzman.  Guzman  for  time  stamping  us   today.  Smash  up  the  like,  subscribe  if   you  like  this  kind  of  streams.  And  also   big  shout  out  to  Kagi  because  Kagi  the   YouTuber  is  actually  in  Bulmania.  He  has   been  in  Bulmania  now  for  for  I  don't   know  some  weeks.  And  he  just  posted  on   you  Twitter  yesterday.  Yesterday  I'm   learning  how  to  trade  with  Ivan  on  take   Bullmania.  So  far  I've  opened  12  trades   and  won  11  trades.  This  is  the  power  of   mechanical  rules.  Um  I've  made  5K  in   profit  in  just  three  days.  The  price   doesn't  matter  only  the  trend.  This  is   the  first  very  very  important  um  uh   realization  everyone  comes  to.  You  have   to  follow  the  trend.  I'm  still  learning.   But  this  is  the  single  best  skill  you   could  ever  learn  in  crypto.  Follow  the   trend.  True,  true,  true,  true,  true,   true.  Especially  now  that  the  world  is   reconfiguring,  trading  is  the  only  skill   where  you  can  be  your  own  boss.  You  can   be  wherever  you  want  anywhere.  Okay.   Anywhere.  Does  Bulmania  accept  hexacons?   If  you  are  a  hex  hexagon  guys,  you   really  need  Bulmania.  I  mean,  your  brain   is  you  you  have  such  damaged  the   understanding  of  of  what  crypto  is.  Uh   the  only  solution,  the  only  cure  I  think   is  bulmania.  Go  to  bulman.com,  watch  the   video,  sign  up  for  the  call.  But  um  you   need  some  serious  intervention  in  your   thinking,  in  your  brain  like  as  soon  as   possible.  And  only  you  yourself  can  take   that  step.  Okay,  very  important.  The   same  with  pulsey  accountance.  You  need   serious  serious  reprogramming  of  your   brain.  Otherwise,  you  get  just  losing.   In  the  last  month,  you  lost  30%  in   pulse.  Uh  I  already  said  you  to  get  out   over  a  year  ago.  And  what's  happening?   What's  happening?  Maybe  even  maybe  soon   two  years  ago.  I  mean,  time  flies  in   crypto.  I  remember  I  did  a  tweet  on  New   Year's  Eve  when  it  was  alltime  low.   Since  then,  it  dumped  another  40%.  You   see  yourself  other  holders  also  need  the   same  kind  of  approach.  Um,  let's  see.   Kagi  also  did  a  nice  long  here.  Big   shout  out.  Fantastic.  This  was   yesterday.  Green  to  clean  did  his  first   uh  trade.  Fantastic  win.  55%  first   winner.  First  winner.  Uh,  stable.   Fantastic.  Uh,  Ryan  also  had  his  first   winner.  Also  stable.  Fantastic.   Fantastic.  And  this  guy  shorted  ADA  plus   200%.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.  So  yeah,  all   in  all,  it's  a  mixed  market  now  where   you  can  both  make  money  both  long  and   short.   And  uh  overall  if  we  are  to  go  to  the  uh   let  me  go  to  the  scanner.  Let's  see  how   the  market  looks  like  and  the  losses   that  have  happened  since  the  bare  flip.   If  we  go  to  crypto  here   and  let's  see  on  the  weekly  what's   happening.  Oh  yeah.  This  is  the  price   everyone  pays  for  not  respecting  the  the   trend.  So  Bitcoin  minus  30%  since  it   turned  bearish.  Uh  and  we  were  bearish   even  before  this  because  we're  looking   at  a  fake  alltime  high  and  bear  on  the   daily.  Bearish  on  the  daily.  But  even  if   you  just  follow  the  weekly,  you  kept  it   simple.  Uh  already  you  see  fantastic   fantastic  uh  gain  if  you  shorted  or  if   you  derisked  just  keeping  it  simple   following  the  uh  the  money  line  on  the   weekly   uh  43%  uh  XRP  minus  40%,  Solana  minus   52.  And  again,  this  just  keeping  it   simple.  Just  looking  at  the  money  line,   not  doing  anything  more  complex.  Just   simple.  Just  simple.  Doggy  dog  minus  45.   Um  guys,  what  you  have?  You  said  you   have  Cardano.  You're  not  doing  well.   You're  doing  very  poor.  You  have  um   Stellar,  you  have  Rain.  I  think  it's  new   one.  That's  why  it  has  such  a  big  game   because  new  coins  are  Yeah,  we  measure   them  when  they  are  created.  So  if  they   are  very  bullish  from  the  beginning,  we   basically  measure  the  whole  thing.   That's  why  it's  so  high.  Hideera  down  a   lot.  Sui  60  oh  61%  in  sui  is  supposed  to   be  the  fundamentals.  Where  is  the   fundamentals?  R  Paul  telling  you  every   day  buy  sui  buy.  What  happens?  It  goes   lower  and  lower.  Avalanche  58%  four   months  ago.  You  see  this  is  why  guys  we   have  no  patience  with  altcoins.  You   remember  as  soon  as  we  became  bearish  in   October  we  said  no  more  alts  because   avalanche  in  the  last  four  months  is   down  58%.  Like  you  cannot  negotiate  with   this.  You  cannot  give  it  any  any  benefit   of  the  doubt.  Uh,  Toncoin  is  down  73%  in   the  last  year  since  the  bare  flip.  So,   you  you  got  to  really  take  it  seriously   when  it  goes  bearish.  Polka  dot  minus  78   since  a  year  ago.   UniS  swap  47%.   A  46%.   Yeah.  Uh,  quite  insane.  Matic  Matic   Matic  73%.  And  a  lot  of  these  are   so-called  blue  chip.  Near  protocol  blue   chip.  What  happened  with  blue  chip  minus   76?  Yeah,  it's  a  brutal  reality.  Guys,   let's  go  to  Q&A.  This  is  all  from  me.   One  thing  is  that  ETH  has  a  new  road  map   until  2029.  I  mean,  all  the  road  maps   are  so  long  into  the  future,  but  maybe   it's  good  because  they  say  that  they   want  speed.   They  want  speed.  The  biggest  focus  is   reducing  latency.  Instead  of  a  sudden   overhaul,  the  plan  proposes  gradually   cutting  slot  times  lower  and  lower.  So,   soon  ETH  is  going  to  be  faster  and   faster  and  faster.  the  uh  foundation  is   uh  really  pushing  you  know  this  new  uh   the  problem  with  their  road  map  no  one   understands  what  it  is  it's  a  mambo   jumbo  fugazi  it's  good  that  they  at   least  explain  a  bit  but  yeah  this  is  NT   pre-ompiles  okay  binary  tree  native   postquantum  transaction  okay  and  so  this   is  2026   oh  no  sorry  this  2029   2030   1  million  million  anti-stations  per   slot.  Okay.   So,  I  guess  it's  good.  I  mean,  as  long   as  they  make  L1  fast,  which  is  the   current  uh  uh  uh  priority,  it's  no   longer  catering  to  L2s.  Uh  is  good.  I'm   bullish.  I  think  it's  very  very  good.   Onchemetrics  uh  this  and  that.  I  I  think   overall  is  good  because  previously  I   think  during  the  last  two  years  or  so   all  of  the  updates  they  were  only  making   it  better  for  L2s  and  L2s  they  steal  the   client  they  steal  the  fee  they  don't   give  anything  back  it's  just  a  copy  of   ETH  without  without  decentralization  and   so  if  all  clients  are  on  L2s  like  what's   the  point  of  L1  Vitalic  has  understood   that  now  this  road  map  seems  to  be  all   about  scaling  L1  before  you  know  all  of   their  updates  was  okay  lower  fees  for  L2   span  why  Why?  They  obviously  don't  pay   anything.  Why  you  need  lower  fees  for   them?  They  already  don't  pay  anything  at   all.  You  don't  need  lower  fees  for  for   L2s.  So,  I  like  that.  Overall,  it's  a   good  update  that's  not  um  uh  catering  to   L2s  only.  Like,  you  have  to  scale  L1.   Very,  very  important.  Guys,  let's  go  to   Q&A  questions,  answers,  debate.   Let's  go.  Let's  go.   I'm  comparing  hype  against  other  alts   going  down  is  looking  stronger  than   others  like  soul.  Do  you  agree?  Yeah,   let's  check.  Let's  check.  Let's  check   hype  USD.   Um  let's  see  where's  the  biggest  chart.   I  mean  it  is  newer.  That's  number  one.   Um,  does  Binance  have  it?  Where's  the   biggest  chart,  man?  Trading  doesn't  have   uh  doesn't  have  uh  hype  itself  like  the   hyperlquid  price  feed.   Okay,  maybe.   Okay,  let  me  just  use  this  one.  I  guess   it's  kind  of  the  chart.   So,  is  it  better  than   I  don't  know,  man.  It's  hard  to  say.   It's  It  went  from  38  to  29.   It's  kind  of  the  per  from  the  top.  How   much  it  fell  from  the   22   how  much?  Well,   58.  Yeah,  I  mean  you  can  say  it's  it's   is  better  is  better  from  the   chart  strength  perspective,  but  it's   because  they  have  revenue  and  revenue   goes  to  the  coin.  Okay,  it  is  still  bare   trend.   Once  Bitcoin  bottoms  out  and  Bitcoin   enters  bull  hype  is  going  to  be  very   important  because  whoever  is  the   strongest  and  you're  right  hype  is   stronger  in  this  um  in  this  bare  market.   Normally  they  also  run  faster  in  the   bull.  Um  I  wouldn't  touch  hype  even  if   it  goes  to  bull  before  bitcoin  goes  to   bull.  I  need  bitcoin  go  to  bull.  I   wouldn't  touch  it  as  you  know  long-term   accumulation.  You  can  uh  long  it  for   short  term.  You  can  do  leverage  long.   that's  fine  but  um  then  exit  it  as  as   soon  as  it  turns  against  you  just  exit.   Uh  if  Bitcoin  goes  to  a  bull  trend  then   hype  is  going  to  be  interesting  as  a   core  huddle  for  the  next  cycle  if  it   also  goes  to  bull  because  yeah  it  is  uh   stronger  when  it  comes  to  chart.  It  also   has  a  revenue  model  which  makes  sense.   People  use  it  every  day.  I  see  people  in   our  community  use  hype  every  day.  More   people  are  probably  using  hyperlquid   than  using  ETH.  I  mean  just  uh  looking   at  the  engagement  people  have  with  hype   it's  crazy  crazy  because  it's  the  best   option  for  trading  leverage  on  chain  and   that's  the  biggest  use  case  in  crypto  it   is  the  biggest  is  bigger  than  any  other   use  case  when  you  look  at  you  know   stable  coin  transfer  or  anything  else   the  average  person  does  more  trades  than   you  know  like  stable  coin  transfer   and  just  looking  here  looking  at  our   community  there  every  day  there's  always   someone  on  hype  like  today  it  was  this   guy  Ryan  he  used  hyperlquid.  The  other   ones  used  by  bit  unix  and  then  here  here   was  hyperlquid.  Here  was  hyperlquid.   Here  was  hyperlquid.  So  is  it  probably   one  of  the  biggest  platforms  now  for   trading  um  and  probably  rivaling  many   centralized  exchanges.  So  they  have   constant  buy  pressure  from  that.  Okay.   So  that's  why  as  soon  as  Bitcoin  is   bullish  and  is  bullish,  fantastic.   remember  onchain  ta.  Yeah,  we  don't  do   too  much  on  onchain  nowadays.  In  2020  or   so,  we  did  more  onchain.  Why  we  don't  do   any  onchain?  Because  it  has  not  survived   our  ruthless,  vigorous  testing  when  we   trade  ourselves.  Onchain  trading,  guys,   it  doesn't  work.  Uh  I  know  some  people   may  tell  you  it  works.  Maybe  it  it  helps   them  to  create  content  to  discuss   something.  Uh  so  they  can  pull  up  some   onchain  chart  so  they  can  have  a  new   title  for  you.  So  you  get  you  get   excited  about  the  chart  on  chain  onchain   as  it  does  not  work  for  trading  because   I  mean  think  yourself  how  do  you  trade   onchain?  Where  is  your  entry?  Where's   where's  your  stop  loss?  Where's  your   position  size?  And  also  uh  you  look  at   the  onchain  guys  this  cycle  all  of  them   have  been  wrong.  Onchain  this  onchain   that  like  that  onchain  guy  from   cryptoquant  he  was  fully  wrong.  He   admitted  it  which  is  great  which  is   great  but  onchain  didn't  help  anything.   Another  problem  with  onchain  as  you  know   is  that  the  data  itself  is  wrong.  It's   simply  wrong.  Why?  Because  you  don't   know  what's  happening  onchain.  A  bitcoin   transfer  is  a  bitcoin  transfer.  It's  not   a  sale.  But  onchain  platforms  will  try   to  predict  that  it's  a  sale.  Onchain.   You  don't  see  whether  bitcoin  was  sold.   It's  very  common  for  users  to  just   change  address  to,  you  know,  do  test   transaction,  but  they  label  it  as  a  as  a   sale.  So,  all  in  all,  I  don't  really   like  onchain  uh  metrics  that  much.  The   only  ones  that  maybe  make  sense  is,  you   know,  how  many  stable  coins  are  created,   but  you  can,  it's  not  really  on  chain.   You  can  see  the  market  cap  of  stable   coins,  but  it's  not  even  on  chain.  Uh   maybe  I  changed  my  mind,  but  I  don't  use   onchain  at  all  now.  uh  I  just  use  uh  the   price  chart  and  it's  way  better.   Whatever  happens  on  chain,  it  will  be   reflected  in  the  price  chart.  Okay?  And   uh  you  exit  when  the  trend  is  bare,  you   enter  when  the  trend  is  bull.  You  keep   it  simple.  That's  it.  You  you  don't  do   anything  more  complex.  Otherwise,  you   have  an  overflow  of  information.  You   want  to  keep  it  simple.  Green  means   bullish,  you  can  uh  you  can  buy  and  red   means  bearish,  you  got  to  sell.  That's   it.  The  more  variables  you  have,  the   more  you  f  your  brain  and  the  more  you   become  paralyzed.  Again,  I'm  releasing   the  book  soon,  guys.  Uh  go  to  go  to  the   newsletter  in  description  if  you  want  to   know  first  about  the  book.  But  you  know,   one  of  the  um  one  of  the  traps  people   fall  into  is  the  information  overload.   Different  sources  give  conflicting   opinions.  One  analyst  says  buy,  another   says  sell.  You  watch  uh  on  the  chart,   the  chart  goes  down,  but  you  forg   yourself  into  checking  onchain  and   onchain  is  bullish.  So  you  convince   yourself  to  hold  and  the  the  freaking   shitcoin  dumps  70%.  The  more  you   consume,  the  more  confused  you  become.   You  can't  make  a  decision  because  you   can  always  find  another  perspective.   Exactly.  That  contradicts  your  current   thinking.  So  onchain  we  don't  really   look  at  it   but  I  know  many  people  look  at  it.  Why?   Because  number  one  is  hopeium.  Hopium  is   engagement.  So  they  just  do  it  anyway.   Get   you  give  them  like.  Uh  by  the  way  you   should  you  should  smash  up  like  here  for   the  truth.  And  then  also  it's  just  you   know  many  people  in  the  space  they   they're  struggling  with  content  like   they  need  something  to  show  you  know   what  chart  to  show  today.  So  they,  you   know,  they  pull  up  some  kind  of  onchain.   They  didn't  show  they  can  discuss  it  a   bit.  So  it's  a  content.  You  really  got   to  differentiate  who  is  doing  content   because  of  content  and  who's  doing   market  analysis.  You  have  to  be  very   ruthless  here  with  who  you  follow   because  otherwise  you're  going  to  have   information  overload.  There's  always   something  you  can  check  more.  you  know,   some  other  opinion,  but  everything  comes   down  to  what's  your  entry,  what's  your   exit,  what's  your  stop-loss,  and  what's   your  position  size.  If  the  content  does   not  help  with  that,   it's  not  it's  not  very  helpful.  It's   infotainment,  which  can  be  fine.  It  can   be  fine.  The  problem  is  people  make   decisions,  trading  decisions  based  on   infotainment  without  knowing  that  that   they're  doing  that.  So  yeah,  that's  that   funds  going  to  exchange  can  be  for   inverse.  Yeah,  see  funds  going  to   exchange  also  doesn't  give  too  much   info.  Uh  we  were  using  it  before.  You   remember  we  were  checking  funds  on   chain.  It  doesn't  really   correlate  and  if  it  does  correlate,  you   see  it  on  the  chart  anyway.  So  what's   the  point  on  the  chart?  You  know  for   sure  what's  happening.  this  you  know   exchange  deposit  exchange  withdraw   sometimes  you  see  it  affect  but   sometimes  not  so  why  even  check  it  if   you  can  you  can  just  check  the  price  and   the  price  will  always  tell  you  if  it's   now  breaking  out  breaking  down  why   confuse  your  brain  with  more  info  okay   anyway  hope  that  makes  sense   should  we  buy  Tesla  now  with  robot  taxi   guys  what  do  you  think  I  don't  know   let's  check  the  chart  that  that  I  can   tell  you  that  I  can  tell  you  whether   robot  Tesla  this  and  that  it's  I  think   it's  also  a  mistake  to  be  too  much  into   you  know  will  they  have  taxi  will  they   not  have  taxi  Because  also  guys,  Elon   Musk,  here's  the  problem  with  Elon  Musk.   You  see,  he's  always  super  bullish.  He   he  all  all  he  says  is  going  to  happen   next  next  week,  next  month.  Tesla   self-driving.  I  remember  in  2016  or   something,  he  said  it's  going to  be  next   year.  It's  like  10  years  later.  We're   kind  of  getting  there.  So,  he's  correct.   Like  everything  he  says,  it's  going  to   happen.  The  problem  is  it  may  take  10   years.  Okay.  So,  I'm  I  I  don't  doubt,   guys.  I  don't  doubt  that  Elon  will  take   us  to  Mars.  I  actually  don't  doubt  it.  I   think  he's  the  only  person  probably  that   can  do  it.  Uh  robot  taxes  uh  I  guess   they  already  work.  I  mean  in  the  US  you   have  robot  taxi  already,  right?  So   please  don't  misunderstand  me.  I  I'm   very  bullish  Elon.  I  think  Elon  is  going   to  do  everything  he  says  because  he  has   not  failed  yet.  Many  people  want  to  hate   him.  They're  saying  that  he  he  was   lying.  But  it  is  true  guys  that  um  he  is   very  optimistic  with  the  timeline  and   that's  also  partially  why  Tesla  has  been   pumping  so  much  historically  because   everyone  thinks  he's  going  to  change  the   world  tomorrow.  But  the  thing  is  that   that  can  wear  off  as  well.  I  mean  we  you   see  massive  dumps  in  Tesla  sometimes   also  where  everyone  starts  to  think  wait   a  lot  of  fugazi  also  in  his  predictions.   So  longterm  I'm  very  bullish  Tesla   longterm.  I  think  he  is  going  to  do   everything  he  also  he's  going  to  merge   with  SpaceX.  like  there's  a  lot  of  re   reemerging  and  stuff  that's  that's  going   to  happen.  It's  very  tough  to  uh  track   all  of  that.  And  what  what  happened  to   to  SpaceX?  They  merged  with  Grock  or   what  what  happened  guys?  All  of  you   Tesla  fanatics,  Elon  Fanatics,  tell  me   more  about  that.  But  I  just  hear  a  lot   that  you  know  Grock  Xai  merged  with   Twitter.  Oh  no,  Twitter.  Exactly.  Xai   merged  with  Twitter.  SpaceX  maybe  going   to  merge  with  like  they're  going  to  all   merge  into  something.  So  it's  too  much   time  to  follow  all  of  it  and  it's   impossible  to  know  for  sure.  like  you   don't  know  for  sure.  Even  if  you  spend   months  researching  it,  how  it's  going  to   be,  you  don't  know  for  sure.  So,   personally,  I  wouldn't  I  wouldn't  even   try  to  understand  it  exactly  what  he's   going  to  do,  how  he's  going  to  merge.   Just  look  at  the  damn  trend,  man.   Apparently,  we're  entering  bare  trend   with  the  next  support  being  here  at  300.   Uh,  currently,  it's  not  a  time  to  buy.   Uh,  because  it  is  a  bare  trend.  I   wouldn't  buy  it  here.  I  would  short  here   with  a  nice  stop-loss  just  in  case  it   starts  pumping.  You  never  know.  But  the   target  of  the  chart  is  around  here.  It's   the  same  as  last  week.  We  said  it's   around  here  15%  down.  So  you  can  short   it  with  leverage  if  you  want  on  buy  bit.   I  believe  you  have  it  on  by  bit.  I'm   almost  100%  sure.  You  have  on  weeks  and   everything.  So  currently  it's  time  to   short.  If  you  want  to  accumulate   long-term,  let's  say  you  don't  have   Tesla  at  all.  You  want  to  accumulate   long-term.  The  accumulation  should  be   here  at  this  support  or  next  time  it   goes  to  bullish.  Now  it's  bearish.  So   you  need  to  wait  for  it  to  go  to   bullish.  If  you  want  to  frontr  run  that,   you  could  buy  here  at  this  support.  But   just  know  that  it  may  even  go  lower  and   you  may  be  buying  a  falling  knife.  But   uh  medium  term,  this  is  a  fair  nice   price  for  Tesla  at  around  uh  yeah  300ish   because  it  is  the  last  consolidation.  It   can  easily  go  down  here  to  220  where   team  Waltz  would  be  super  happy  because   he  said  that  it's  going  to  go  to  zero   here  at  220  and  then  it  went  up  100%.   So  this  is  how  I  work  guys.  This  is  how   I  work.  I  know  many  people  want  me  to  be   more  romantic.  I  haven't  imagined  we're   gonna  go  to  Mars  with  Elon  in  a  rocket.   We're  gonna  fly.  What  about  the  space   colony?  What  about  the  Optimus?  Optimus   is  going  to  cut  your  grass.  It's  going   to  cut  your  garden.  It's  going  to  cut   your  plum  plumbing.  It's  going  to  cut   your  electricity.  I  love  that.  I  love   that.  I  love  that.  I  love  that.  But  this   is  again  how  do  I  trade  it?  Where  is  the   entry?  Where  is  the  stop?  Okay.  Where  is   it?  Where  is  Where  is  it?  It's  not  here.   Is  it  in  the  room  with  us?  It's  not  in   the  room  with  us.  So  that's  why  we  just   keep  it  simple.  We  follow  the  trends  and   we  ride  it  to  Valhalla.  Now  let's  say   you  are  um  super,  you  know,  you're  a   Tesla  fanatic.  What  can  you  do?  You   really  love  Elon.  You  don't  want  to  be   shaken  out  of  your  positions  and  uh  uh   how  do  you  do?  But  at  the  same  time,  if   it  goes  to  zero,  you  don't  want  to   huddle  to  zero.  Okay,  go  to  twoe  chart.   You  can  you  can  work  on  two  week  chart.   You  can  work  on  monthly  chart.  Uh  so   there  are  ways  to  to  uh  to  remove  more   of  this  you  know  back  and  forth  chop.   You  can  go  to  higher  time  frame  but  for   most  people  the  best  is  the  weekly.  I   mean  the  weekly  is  the  best  for  most   stocks.  It's  the  best  for  most  assets.   So  for  most  people  I  would  say  just  skip   to  the  weekly.  So  yeah  that's  with   Tesla.  Yes guys  that's  with  Tesla.   You  want  Yeah,  exactly.  I  want  Optimus.   I  want  Optimus.  But  I  I  mean  when  it   comes  to  trading  when  it  comes  to   trading  I  will  not  be  betting  my  trades   that  Optimus  is  going  to  come  and  cut   the  grass  here.  I  mean,  it  would  be  nice   if  I  wouldn't  have  to  call  blue  collar   uh  you  know,  person  to  come  and  fix   stuff.  Why?  Because  it's  all  I  mean,   it's  always  something,  you  know,  they're   late  or  they  they  they  don't  have  time   or  or  maybe  they  come  next  week,  maybe   not  next  week,  maybe  they  fix  it,  maybe   they  need  to  refix  it.  Like,   yeah,  when  you  have  a  bigger  property,   it's  uh  it's  problem,  man.  You  because   everything  goes  kind  of  in  a  cycle.  you   fix  something  here  but  uh  by  the  time   they  fix  here  something  else  is  is   broke.  So  it's  always  like  it's  a  never   ending  cycle  of  fixing  and  then  each   time  you  need  to  call  in.  Yeah.  So   that's  why  you  basically  sooner  or  later   to  to  handle  the  all  of  this  you  need   assistance.  So  it  would  be  better  of   course  if  you  had  like  freaking  Optimus   fixing  all  of  that  here.  I  mean  that   this  is  not  I'm  not  excited  by  the   Optimus  thing  so  much  that  I  would  go   all  in  Tesla  just  blindly  when  it  just   enters  a  bare  trend.  Okay.  And  this  is   what  people  want  me  to  say.  I  aren't  you   excited?  Aren't  you  excited?  Aren't  you   excited  about  Mars?  You're  not  excited.   You're  not  excited.  Why  are  you  not   excited?   That's  that.  Does  that   were  complaining  there  was  no  season   because  you  were  using  the  all  season   chart  this  and  that.  Um,  yeah,  I  mean   that's  true.  That's  true.  We  were   looking  at  the  old  season  chart.  We  were   supposed  to  go  into  this  blue  chip  uh   old  season  which  never  happened  and  and   we  changed  our  mind  instantly  in  October   and  that  was  a  big  lesson  that  you  know   when  you  that  that  we  actually  played   correctly  that  when  trend  is  bearish   you're  out.  But  it's  still  true  that  all   season  did  happen  like  we  did  see  all   season  in  um  in  the  other  coins  not  the   traditional  ones.  So  if  anything  this   system  supported  us  in  a  nice  way  the   system  with  bare  and  bull  trend  bullish   or  bullish  and  you  know  in  a  bull  market   we  look  at  many  bullish  thing  just  like   in  a  bare  market  we  have  to  be  more   bearish  we're  we're  biased  towards  the   bull  in  a  bull  and  we're  bearish  we're   biased  towards  the  bear  in  in  the  bear.   So  I  would  say  that  this  you  know  this   chart  with  all  season  it's  not  something   that  we're  going  to  be  using  even   showing  next  time  because  uh  just  like   with  onchain  in  the  past  we  used  on   chain  we  don't  use  on  chain  now  I  think   this  chart  is  kind  of  like  that  also   where  it's  it's  too  much  opinionated  and   in  the  bull  I  mean  again  we  were  biased   in  the  bull  uh  but  as  soon  as  the  bear   came  we're  out  October  since  October   we're  out  so  the  system  worked  perfectly   and  it's  another  example  where  you   mainly  look  at  the  trend  everything   Everything  else  is  fugazi.  Everything   else  is  fugazi.  So  uh  that  chart  is  uh   no  bueno  in  terms  of  basing  your  trades.   You  base  the  trade  on  the  system.  Okay?   And  since  October  we're  bare.  No  one  can   take  it  away  from  us.  October  8th  no  one   can  take  it  away  from  us.   But  you  know  historically  we  we  uh  we   did  all  kinds.  I  mean  historically  since   you  know  I'm  a  crypto  since  2013.  I   probably  made  all  all  the  mistakes   possible  with  you  know  looking  at  the   tag  to  to  all  kinds  of  stuff  and  this  I   wouldn't  even  call  it  a  mistake.  It's   it's  one  of  these  uh  things  kind  of  like   fear  and  greed  kind  of  like  many  other   things  people  look  at  uh  that  uh  that   that  we  discuss  but  the  key  is  always   the  trend  trend  and  the  system   but  yeah  good  question  they  don't  have   time  because  too  much  work.  Exactly.   Exactly.  Exactly.  So  we  need  optimus.  We   need  optimus  as  soon  as  possible.   Ivan,  it's  interesting.  You're  streaming   in  this  bear.  Could  you  please  explain   your  change  of  mind  for  doing  bare   market  live  stream?  Well,  I  mean,  you   guys  watch  uh  we  have  a  very  nice   community,  so  it's  fun  to  do.  Um  and  uh   yeah,  I  mean,  as  as  long  as  you  guys   smash  up  the  like,  as  long  as  you  guys   watch,  we  do  content.  Uh  uh  it's  fun   also.  I  mean,  I  love  doing  it  every  day.   I  wouldn't  be  doing  it  if  it  wasn't  fun,   okay?  It  would  be  impossible  to  do.  And   then,  of  course,  if  no  one  watches,  we   also  don't  do  it.  But  if  you  guys  watch,   you  guys  smash  the  like.  I  mean,  also,   we  were  so  right  in  October.  I  want  to   ensure  everyone  remembers  that  we  were   right  in  October.  So,  I'm  like,  man,  let   let  me  do  another  stream.  Let  me  remind   everyone.  We're  bearish  since  October.   We  have  such  great  track  record.   Probably  the  best  track  record  on   YouTube,  guys.  I  mean,  honestly,  since   October,  I  don't  know.  Have  anyone  else   been  that  great  since  October?  you  know,   every  day,  every  day  we  do  and  we  we  we   call  it  so  nicely  and  uh  basically   saving  probably  hundreds  of  millions  of   dollars  in  portfolio  value,  maybe  even   billions  in  portfolio  value  uh  in  the   audience.  So  from  that  perspective,  man,   it's  also  fun  because  it's  fantastic,   man.  It's  it's  Yeah,  we've  been  so   great.  So  so  fantastic.  So  it's  also  fun   for  that  reason.  I  like  probably  today   I'll  find  a  way  to  remind  everyone  that   we're  right  on  October  8th.  Exactly.   And  then  Guzman.  What's  Guzman  gonna  do   without  the  streams,  guys?

Guzman  says,  \"I  will  fade  into   nothingness.\"  Exactly.  I  guess  it's   good.  Good  vibe.  I  love  I  love  I  love   doing  it.  It's  It's  great.  It's  great.   It's  great.

The analyst suggests that the geometric structure of the consolidation is positive and past movements indicate bullish signals for future increases. The prevailing bearish trend continues, yet the long-term buying zones present a favorable situation for investors. The rise of AI is expected to trigger large-scale layoffs within the tech industry, posing new challenges for workers. Future economic trends may increase societal tensions as the gap between the middle class and the wealthy widens. The biggest challenge will be the layoff of experienced workers, necessitating the creation of new job roles, particularly in blue-collar sectors.",
