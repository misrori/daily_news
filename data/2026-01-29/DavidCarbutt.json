        "transcript": "Hello ladies and gentlemen. I've got a big show for you today. In clip one, we've got the guys from the Moonshot podcast calling Claude 4.0 the Gutenberg press of software creation, basically the printing press, and we'll dig into why they think many software companies are about to become obsolete. Then in clip two, we're looking at something that seemed impossible 2 years ago. A Tesla Model Y driving around Austin with nobody inside. No safety driver, no supervisor, just cameras and AI. And then finally, we'll see a clip from Jensen Hang who comments on what's coming for AI in the next few months. And the teaser is it's huge. Uh, you know, Claude 4.5 is making waves and uh let's chat a little about it and the hyperscaler growth that's coming. Uh, I love this quote from Sergey Karv. Uh he says Claude code with Opus 4.5 is a watershed moment moving software creation from an artisal craftsman activity to a true industrial process. It's the Gutenberg press, the sewing machine and the photo camera. >> And I I think this is an inflection point. Some are calling it AGI. I think that's that's nonsense because I I would argue we've had some form of generality regardless of how you know as we've quibbled in past over what AGI itself means. We've had arguably some form of generality for now the past 5 and a half or so years. But there's an inflection point of some sort that's been reached. Caveat caveat. Every point on an exponential curve feels like a knee and almost a hyper exponential inflection point in terms of these autonomy horizons. And it's to the point where it we've talked in the pod in the past about the AI 2027 forecast. there was an alternative forecast, a derivative of that rather than projecting autonomy time horizons would be exponential, projecting that they'd be hyperexponential. So an exponential of an exponential and it looks and I I write about this every day. It looks like at this point more likely that that's the trend that we're on specifically with cloud code plus opus 4.5 clus and GPT 5.2 and two codecs being able to accomplish absurd amounts of autonomy like creating allegedly entire web browsers in Rust with functioning allegedly JavaScript engines from scratch that would have taken years historically. So if if this trend continues I I really do think these these autonomy time horizons pushing from 5 hours to weeks to months to years that that is gamechanging. Yeah, I totally agree. And uh it's actually there's a lot of research uh showing what I'm experiencing, which is writing code is actually harder than ever in terms of taxing your brain because the machine creates code so quickly uh that you can't even keep up with, you know, normally in the old days when I would write code, I'd have all the time in the world to be thinking about what I was architecting because it would take so long to bang out the code itself. Now you you launch like five or 10 compar agents, you know, all for me they're all Opus 4.5. Um, and they're all working on different parts of your product or your project concurrently and they get done so quickly and so independently that it's almost hard to track. You know, it's a imagine you have like a 100 employees working for you and you gave them all marching orders and you know, mentally tracking what all 100 are doing is very very taxing. And so during this kind of transition phase of the singularity, the brain taxing is higher than ever. And and this survey research is showing up like productivity is going through the roof, but it's very stressful by the end of the week if you're an AI master, you know, and you're running a a monster repo of these things. So my bill, you know, my claude bill is running between $100 and,000 a day now. Uh, you know, tipping on the high side. And the amount of code I've created in the last couple months is bigger than my entire life combined up until till now. >> And here's the next slide here. What's it going to do to the software industry and the AI industry? Uh a friend May sent me both of these these tombstones here. And one is you know rest in peace all of the SAS companies and then rest in peace all of the uh you know vibe coding companies. And I am curious uh all of a sudden if you can rebuild Salesforce, SAP, Stripe by giving it, you know, the proper prompts and if Claude code is enabling us, you know, an individual to code as fast as any of the other specialty companies, what do you guys imagine is going to happen? Are we going to have a uh are they going to be able to compete? Will they stay relevant? >> Well, there's a lot of truth on this a lot of truth on this slide. Um, but I think the meta topic is look forever hereafter you have to pivot constantly as a tech company. The the days when you could rest on your your recurring cash flow laurels and not improve your product for 20 years like Microsoft anything those are gone. Uh, and you look at the majority now of of the revenue from these companies like Microsoft and Oracle is from their cloud business. So they're not, you know, they're not dead. They they've moved to cloud very quickly. But if they haven't moved, you know, any anyone who's sitting there not pivoting and not attracting great new talent to help with the pivot, yeah, you're doomed. But that's been true. You know, if you look at the Magnificent Seven, uh I think we counted six out of the seven are doing something fundamentally different from what made them big in the first place. And so the future of the world belongs to flexible companies, you know, Selen style exponential organizations that can pivot and improve constantly. >> Only the paranoid survive. AI coding agents are compressing years of software development into weeks and that compression rate keeps accelerating. So the comparison to the Guttenberg press is actually pretty apt when you think about it. Before the printing press, creating a book was a artisan craft. A single monk might spend years copying one manuscript. After you could produce thousands in the time it used to make one and that's what's happening with software right now. David mentions his claw bill is running up to a thousand bucks per day, but he's produced more code in the last two months than his entire career combined. And that math is insane when you actually sit down and think about it for a few moments. And the autonomy time horizons they're discussing are one of or is one of the key metrics here. A year ago, these AI coding agents could handle tasks that took maybe 15 minutes of human work, but now they're doing multiplehour projects. The trajectory they're tracking suggests weeks and months are coming fast. If you've used claw code or replet recently, you know that this isn't just hype. You can describe an app you want and it just builds it for you. It's pretty mind-blowing stuff when you give it a try yourself. The gap between ideas and working prototypes has collapsed from months to days. The SAS tombstone slide I thought was pretty funny, but there is real truth in it. If an individual can spin up a functioning CRM or project management tool in an afternoon using claw code, why would a company pay Salesforce hundreds of thousands of dollars a year? The answer used to be because building custom software is expensive and hard. That's becoming less true every month. The only survivors are going to be companies that pivot constantly. They said six out of the seven mag seven companies are doing something fundamentally different from what made them big. That's the pattern right now. You either adapt or you get rebuilt by someone's weekend project. The brain taxing point is actually underappreciated too. When you're running 10 parallel agents building different parts of your product, you become the bottleneck. It's like managing 100 employees who work at 10 times normal speed. People who figure out how to operate effectively in that environment are going to have enormous advantages over those who can't. And right now, most companies haven't even started that learning curve. If you want some help on the AI learning curve, I built a step-by-step guide to help beginners get an understanding of the AI landscape. It's basically the course I wish I had access to when I first started diving into AI. If you join today, you'll get lifetime access to all current modules and any future modules. The price will be increasing every time we add a new module, and we'll be thinking about adding a new one soon. So, that's the software side of AI eating the world. The same underlying technology, neuronets, massive compute, continuous learning is also reshaping physical industries. Now, we're looking at Tesla's autonomous vehicles in Austin. And what makes this moment different from Whimo operating in San Francisco or Phoenix is the hardware or more accurately the lack of it. >> Is this a big feat to >> This is a definitely a significant development. Um, it's another major player in the autonomous vehicle space. Um, and it shows more confidence in the technology, but it's still pretty limited and um, uh, it's definitely an experiment. >> It's an experiment. >> Regina, I'm just going to jump in. People on the Tesla side of the camp say this is a notable moment because it's a first for a visiononly based platform to be on public roads, not just with no one in the driver's seat, but no supervising attendant in the passenger seat either. People would also note that there were other restrictions on social media, for example. There were support vehicles from Tesla, it is alleged and claimed. That said, the vision only part, the distinction that Tesla's system relies only on cameras whereas Whimo has a multi-ensor suite. Your interpretation of why that's significant? >> Well, I think there are a couple of companies including Zuks and Tesla that are really designing vehicles that are intended to be uh purpose-built for autonomous driving and for autonomous ride hailing. So it is a significant development. Um and I think at the end of the day what's great is that there are multiple players that are entering the market. Um which ultimately for cities is a good thing because it makes the regulatory landscape easier for them to manage. >> Regulatory landscape has not held back other competitors to this point. And when you think about a few a handful of Teslas on the road and you compare that to a million rides that we're all having per month already using Whimo and they're aiming at for a million per week. How much are we able to really say that Tesla's winning here or not? >> Um I think it's still very early days. Um but the landscape is moving much more quickly especially over the last 3 years and you see these new players entering the market with commercial bride hailing services. Um but I don't think that you know it's clear that there's any one winner at this point in time. Um although Whimo is significantly ahead at the moment in terms of commercial right hailing as you mentioned they're estimating it to reach a million rights per week by the end of the year. Um but it's still anyone's market um to win um and it's exciting to see more players enter it. >> Yeah. Yeah, in simple terms, people define Whimo being ahead by the number of cities it's deployed in without any human supervision in the car, hand charging a fair to passengers. I'd love to talk about the human side of this though, right? In your research at a number of academic institutions over the years, do we have the evidence yet that the general population feels ready to jump in a robo taxi as their sort of chosen method of transport? I think that um in San Francisco there's a lot of data to suggest that consumers uh do uh really feel comfortable utilizing Whimo and certain segments of customers preferring Whimo and even being willing to pay more um for that vehicle over let's say an Uber or Lyft. Um so I think that people are becoming very comfortable very quickly um with these vehicles and we'll just continue to see that happen. Tesla proved that a mass-produced car using only cameras can drive itself without any human backup and that changes the entire economics of autonomous transportation. The analyst we just saw in the clip calls it significant but still an experiment. I think that undersells what just happened. This is a Model Y driving around public roads with nobody inside. No liar, no radar, no safety driver, just some cameras and a computer and software. Tesla builds nearly 2 million of these per year. The hardware is already everywhere for when they want to scale. Whimo's approach works. They're doing a million rides a month, and nobody's arguing the technology isn't impressive. But every Whimo vehicle needs a custom sensor suite that costs tens of thousands of dollars. They don't build their own cars, so they're dependent on partnerships. And crucially, that sensor complexity doesn't scale the way Tesla's approach does. If Vision only works, then every Tesla with hardware 4 already has the capability. That's millions of vehicles versus Whimo's hundreds or thousands. The technical debate about cameras versus liar also misses a bigger point. The real question is who has the brain? The massive neural nets, the training infrastructure, the billions of miles of real world data. Tesla's predicted to get to 10 billion miles worth of autonomous data by June this year. Tesla's FSC development is essentially a software program going through data for training, finding edge cases, and then running simulations. And as the clip from earlier shows, AI is making all of that development faster. Better coding agents means faster FSD improvement. These systems feed each other. The analyst says it's anyone's market to win. And I understand why she's hedging that way. But the cost structure tells a different story. If Tesla can roll out unsupervised driving to its existing fleet through a software update, the unit economics are completely different from building and deploying custom robo taxi vehicles. The Model Y already exists. The factories already run. the customers already bought the car. The marginal cost of turning a Tesla into an autonomous vehicle is very low, maybe even zero. It's just software. That's an advantage that compounds over time in ways that are hard for competitors to match. Now, let's take a look at what Jensen Wang said about what's coming for AI in the near future. Pay attention because this is huge. >> It's for sure now we're going to have a very large 2026. >> You said that you had what a backlog, a big backlog, $500 billion in backlog. Tell us about that. Where are you on that? Well, since I said that a few months ago, that backlog has gotten bigger than that. And so, I think we're see we're just seeing um you know, AI has gone from uh these language models to now going into health care, into drug discovery, into manufacturing. This last year, we made huge breakthroughs in this area called physical AI where AI understands the world. It understands causality and the laws of physics and you know you can use it for self-driving cars and of course we're going to see huge breakthroughs in self-driving cars. It's going to be all over robotic systems of all kinds. >> Okay. So the rubling what is the most advanced trip? >> It's 10 times more energy efficient than Blackwell. It's 10 times lower cost for generating tokens than Blackwell. 10 times. And Blackwell was 10 times that of Hopper. So every single year we're driving up energy efficiency and we're driving down the token costs. This way AI can continue to be affordable, more clever, more smart while being more affordable for everybody to use. >> There's a debate on whether or not China should actually be getting our chips. What's your take? You want to obviously sell to that market, but are there risks with regard to national security? First of all, H200 now used by their military because their military like our military builds on our own chips and they build plenty of great chips. Huawei and many new startups, they've all gone public this year. Hundreds of billions of dollars of market value now in building AI chips. So, they have lots of AI chips for themselves. Um, with respect to H200, uh, we remember the AI stack is five layers deep and we want to win the AI race and we we need to win the AI race at every single layer. We want to win the energy layer. We want to win the chip layer, the infrastructure layer, the AI model layer and also the application layer. President Trump wants us to go win the marketplace, compete around the world, bring home jobs, create revenue for the United States, and continue to lead the technology around the world. We can't concede any market. And so having the ability to keep United States at the forefront with Blackwell today and very soon Reuben, but allowing allowing American chip companies to compete around the world, we have the benefit of having a thoughtful and balanced strategy. >> I want to ask you about the question that you hear all the time and that is with all of this money being spent on AI, are we inching toward bubble territory? >> Future R&D budget is going to drive enormous amount of infrastructure. We're going to be, you know, it's very likely this is the largest infrastructure buildout in human history and over the course of the next 15 years. A lot of estimates come in at, you know, $85 trillion. And so we're going to build a lot of infrastructure. >> Ads are expensive and people don't trust them anymore, but they do trust YouTube. That's why three of our clients now make $100,000 a month for their business from growing a YouTube channel. If you run a business, book a call with me and I'll help you map this"
