        "transcript": "Hey folks, this is Tom Nash. Welcome back to another video. Don't click nothing. Don't smash nothing. Don't buy nothing. Just listen. Now, this is a gamechanging moment for Tesla. This is a huge earnings call. Probably the most important earnings call in Tesla's history. But as I expected, most investors are not going to see what's going on until it's plain and obvious. By that point, it's going to be way too late. The real money is made in misunderstanding companies like Tesla. And boy oh boy was Tesla misunderstood from day one. Since Tesla went public, it actually dropped 30% or more 11 times. That's a lot. In that time frame, if you just held Tesla from IPO day till present time, you're up 33 and a half thousand% on your investment. So this ain't my first rodeo with Tesla. Tesla is 20% of my portfolio. And even though I had an amazing run with Palunteer over the past few years, I believe, as I said in my previous video, Tesla is the next Palunteer moment just waiting to happen. And this earnings call proves it beyond the shadow of a doubt. And I'm going to show you why in this video. So whether you are an existing Tesla shareholder or you're considering buying more Tesla stock, maybe starting a position, this video is for you. Please listen carefully. Now, on this earnings call, the least important part in my opinion was the fact that Tesla beat top and bottom earnings. That's cool that they beat revenue and that they beat earnings per share, but this is probably the least important section that I want to focus on today because it doesn't matter. It does not matter with Tesla. It's about the future. And everybody in the comment going, \"It's the future, bro. Go right ahead. Do it as much as you want. I don't care.\" Now, think about it. beating top and bottom is cool. Revenue although remains stagnant. In fact, it dropped 1.2%. Nothing to write home about. If you just analyze the earnings call from a very objective place and you just look at the numbers, there's nothing unique there. In fact, you would have said, well, it's a pretty kind of lukewarm at best earnings call. Nothing special. But then you listen to what Elen is saying and then you examine Tesla the way I explained in my previous video and all of a sudden your head is going to pop open because this is going to blow your mind. So on this call Elen actually said something very very important. He said that they're going to discontinue Model S and Model X in 2026 and the Freement facility is going to convert it to manufacturing Optimus fulltime. Okay, this is meaningful Optimus production starting in 2026 when everybody said this is years away and Elen also said that this will be bigger than vehicles which is kind of a duh. No, of course that's not even the point. Of course it's going to be bigger than vehicles but in my opinion it's going to be way bigger than anybody understands now with 1.1 million FSD subscribers as it stands today. Basically Elen is saying hey we got a robo taxi launch coming up. We're not waiting for the regulators. We're going to launch in select cities. The cyber cap production is going to start within 2026. And then he basically explained how the entire FSD robo taxi is more of an ecosystem network effects, not so much the way you sell a car. It's a completely different way to think about business because here we're talking about recurring revenues, subscriptions, ecosystems. It's not the same as Tesla selling a Model S or Model X. Okay. Now, Elon also announced a $20 billion capex in 2026. And he said it's going to go for AI, compute, training, infrastructure, and all this thing. And I'll talk about it in a second. But to me, this is the most important thing because when somebody says AI a lot in the earnings call, that's all fine and dandy, but I don't care what people say. I care what people do. And in my world, where you put your money is what you want to do. And if you're going to commit $20 billion in a year, it means that you're pretty serious about it. Now, he also talked about energy storage demand being literally unlimited. He basically said, \"Look, as many of them mega packs we can manufacture, there's demand. There's a year's worth of backlog for this thing. The only constraint is our ability to produce more.\" As I said in my previous video, Tesla energy is going to be massive. The only thing stopping it just can't make enough of them. Now, he also said something that I think really kind of resonated with me back in 2022 when Palunteer was doing the same thing. In 2022, Palanteer was saying, \"Look guys, we don't care about looking cool and looking good in any particular quarter. That's nice, but it's not about that for us. We can really work on our margins a little bit and have a little bit more Wall Street approach for these earnings, but for us, it's not about looking good in this quarter. It's about driving our long-term goal which is to dominate an entire sector, dominate entire market. And Neil Biski said, \"Look, this is what we're doing.\" So if it makes us look bad in a particular quarter, so be it. That justifies those are the means towards the bigger end, which is dominate the market for the next 10 years. Now, my take is very, very simple. Number one, I think this was pretty much the first hands down 0% automotive earnings call that I've seen with Tesla. I've seen a lot of them, but this is the first time when Elon just literally embraced, hey, we don't even care about the auto stuff. It's not even about that. And I love that because I think it's it's the right way to go because this is Tesla's future. Now, he basically gave us zero talk or emphasis on nearterm auto performance, which I think is going to anger a lot of people. It's going to trigger a lot of people who are very nearsighted, then that's fine, right? Some is going to hate it. And you know what? Tesla stock isn't for everyone, and that's fine. I have no issues with that. Now, what I think this earnings call really represents is two things. Number one is capital allocation, and number two is the direction. So capital allocation is basically where Tesla wants to be in the next 5 to 10 years. And the direction is basically well this is what we're going to do to get from point A to where we want to be to that capital allocation. It's basically like you know if you talk to a guy and he says look I wish I had white teeth but they smoke cigarettes and they drink coffee and they don't go to a dental hygienist whatever the case may be. Right? So it's nice to want nice teeth but what are you doing about it? you know what are the actions you're taking to get whit same thing for losing weight same for everything so in this call I love that Elen said hey we want to be in that place and this is what we're going to do to be there within the next 5 10 years now if you listen to Ilen on this call he really kind of explains to you why the automotive sector doesn't really matter for anything beyond funding the next warp jump of Tesla right basically the automotive sector is right now being used as a cash cow to finance the next scurve for Tesla, which is FSD, robotics, energy, and robo taxi. Now, the thing that most people still kind of misunderstand that Elen is talking about this temporarily. He's not trying to kill the automotive business, and he's not saying that the automotive business is dying. Right now, Tesla is fighting price versus price against the Chinese companies. It's a very, very hard sale, right? But once FSD launches and Tesla has real FSD, real self-driving cars for everyone, the car isn't going to be an issue anymore because people will be buying FSD. And Tesla, the vehicle, the hardware is going to be the printer with Tesla selling the ink. And the Chinese will never be able to compete with that, nor any other manufacturer because they won't have real self-driving cars on the road just like Tesla. So FSD once released into the wild is going to bring back demand and I think by 2030 Tesla is going to sell double than the amount of vehicles it sold in 2025. There's a lot of CEOs that a lot of experts who talk on these earnings call and they promise you all the stuff amazing things they make sure to talk about AI etc etc and it sells really well. It's a good marketing tool, right? But at the end of the day, there's very few companies who are willing to commit massive capital towards AI. Massive. Obviously, the hyperscalers are doing it. And in that group, we'll put Oracle, who's committing massive resources. But the only other company that's not a hyperscaler that's actively doing this right now is Tesla. Tesla essentially yesterday said, \"Hey, we're going to commit $20 billion just in 2026, half our money to make this dream come true. Now, with Fremont basically going into Optimus Land essentially becoming a real production site, we're no longer talking, and this is what I want people to understand, about some experimental robot that's kind of built slowly and presented at events. We're talking about real production. Fremont is going to be producing real robots. It's not about prototypes anymore. It's about real robotics, not some marketing BS. And this is what I think Elen is going for. He's actually going to try and do it. Now, whether he's successful or not, now I think he will be, but whether he's successful or not, this is real. This isn't some marketing BS. He's actually going for this. Now, the thing is, right, is doing this with zero dollars of investing in marketing his automotive sector. Think about it. With automotive companies, if you have a demand decline, you're going to try to combat that, right? You're going to try to increase demand. You're going to try to invest in marketing and advertising. You're going to try to take all sorts of routes to basically increase how much money is coming in because you are a car company. Now, if Elon Musk is saying, I don't care about the declining demand in the short term. It just shows you how much of a not a car company Tesla is. It doesn't matter because at the end of the day, Tesla still somehow by some investor is viewed as a car company, which is absolutely redonkulous. Now, short-term investors have never understood Tesla. I do not expect that to change after this earnings call. But I urge you to look at one thing. If debt at a company balance sheet is pretty much prison, which Tesla has almost none, cash is freedom, which Tesla has a lot of, how many companies, which again not hyperscalers, not Nvidia, who can put up 20 billion in a year to create an advantage to create some sort of a monopoly. Reminds me a lot of Talenteer in 2022 when they were literally creating a similar monopoly being hated by everybody and not understood. People have this struggle with discomfort. Whenever a company is in a state of discomfort, a lot of investors interpret this as some sort of a problem. Oh, this is bad. Discomfort. Discomfort is growth. And you can't have growth without discomfort. Same thing rear. I mean, killing Model S, Model X is painful. Elon doing that, I'm sure, isn't a pleasant thing to do, right? There's an emotional reaction from a lot of investors about it, but again, they are missing the point. The point is not so much about Model S and Model X. It's about allocating resources, allocating capacity, production bandwidth, and the way he announced the whole thing was so unceremonious. Just shows you how little of an importance this has on his agenda. Now, you can talk all day about automotive margins. Go right ahead. Do it in the comments. I don't care. That's not the story. Okay? Automotive revenue right now, automotive cash flow right now is a tool to fund the future. I'm still of the opinion that it's going to grow back once FSD gets released full-blown, but that's not the point. Wall Street is going to hyperfocus on the margins, on the automotive demand. They're never going to get it. Okay? Elon has been a step ahead of these guys since he went public, but they still refuse to yield. They always want to prove their point. Now, at the end of the day, you know, Optimus is not going to be a car. And what I mean by that is beyond the obvious. Obviously, the robot isn't a car. But what do I mean by that? Well, when you sell a vehicle, you know, it's a one-off. You sold the vehicle, there's some services that you can market, but essentially that vehicle is how you scale. You sell more vehicles, you make more money, right? And with robotics, it's a little bit different. And I talked about it a little bit earlier. It's more of a printer versus ink business, right? When you're selling these robotics, when you're selling these Optimus bots, whatever they're going to be called, you're selling a platform. You're selling a network through which you're going to be marketing apps, software solutions, and different kind of things to charge recurring software 80% gross margin revenue on. So, think of these robotics, think of these Optimus bots as a phone on which you sell apps, on which you sell software. The real money is in the ink, not the printer. And as I said, there's a lot of similarities with FSD. The more robotics you deploy, the better data you have, which means you can improve your robots, which means more people want to buy them. So you have more deployed, more data, etc., etc. Just like Elon basically created the monopoly in FSD and full self-driving and autonomous is going to create this monopoly with robotics. Optimus is just the infrastructure. The idea here is to push the software, the recurring revenue, right? Tesla has everything in place to make it happen, which most don't. Tesla has the money. It has the employees, top tier talent. It has battery expertise, electric motor expertise, vision sensors expertise, AI expertise, and the production and the supply chain and the CEO that's willing to commit 20 billion a year to make this happen. Everything is in place to make this the next monopoly for Tesla, just like Palunteer happened to be in 2022. and Tesla happens to be a much bigger company, it doesn't change the same fact, which is this is the moment before the warp jump that Tesla is going to take. Let's be honest here for a second, okay? With some companies, when you see a margin drop, that is a consequence. A consequence of bad management, lack of sales, lack of demand, you name it. With Tesla, it's a conscious decision. Tesla has decided to let this happen because they're pivoting from business A to business B. That pivot is by definition is going to cause a margin erosion and less sales of the old legacy product. That pivot isn't free. It's going to cost you a few eggs in the short term. That's why Elon said, \"We don't mind looking bad for a quarter or two. It doesn't really matter.\" Now energy on top of this is something that is completely ignored somehow by the investing community when in fact it went from being a concept you know 5 years ago into a real massive business. It is real. It is insanely predictable with insane demand backlog of years which Elon isn't kidding about and stable growth forward. It's a high margin business. The only thing that's basically stopping energy from being another hundred billion dollar business is just manufacturing capacity for Tesla. And the one thing Elon has been really good at solving is manufacturing capacity. So I don't expect the energy business to continue to grow at the same level at 20% 30% per year. I expect an exponential movement here as well because Elen isn't going to leave all this money on the floor. And that's why Elen's going to continue to do what he's done since day one, which is sacrifice looking good in the short term in return of looking great in the long term, looking like a genius in the long term. Like I said in the beginning, since the IPO of Tesla, it's been down more than 10 times, 30% or more. That's insane. But at that time, it's up 33 and a half thousand%. Now, demand is willing to put up $20 billion to secure that number one position. And I don't think he's looking at it as a cost, as some sort of a way to buy himself time. This is the trigger. This is the fuse is going to light this whole thing on fire. Now, the numbers are going to scare some investors, and that's fine. That's always been the case. But Tesla is positioning itself to be the number one player in every single secular trend for the next 10 years. Robotics are going to be the biggest market we've ever seen of any product. FSD and robo taxi are going to be massive. Energy is going to be way bigger than automotive is today, double or more. And all that's going to happen by 2030 to 2035. It's not that long in the future. It's in fact a lot quicker than people understand. Tesla is an AI company and people still kind of try to pigeon hole it or shoehorn it into an automotive analysis and that's what screwed most investors over the past 10 years with Tesla. Reinvestment into a new business is not a decline, folks. When Tesla is reinvesting into creating a new business, into a pivot, that's not a bad thing. It may look bad for the uneducated short-term investor, but so be it. Now, in my previous video, I gave you price targets for the next five and 10 years. I'm just going to repeat them here so you have it and it's clear. For the next five years, Tesla is barecase $1,800, bullcase $4,800. That's a,000% by 2030. On 2035 at minimum, barecase 3,750, which is a 760% increase, 7900, $7,900 per share by 2035, which is 1,700% upside for Tesla, assuming the bullcase pans out. This Friday, I'm going to do something incredible, something I haven't done before, and it's going to blow people's mind. This Friday, I'm sharing my entire model for Tesla. Everything from my assumptions to KPIs to complete breakdowns, analysis at DCF, price targets, everything for the next 10 years. every single data point, all the work I've done for the past five years on Tesla, I've compiled it into one model, which I'm going to share with my Roic Academy members this Friday. It's going to go up in the academy as a recorded session and the model is going to be available for download for every single academy member. If you are considering joining the academy, I think this is the right time. Join us this Friday so you can get ahead of the crowds. You can understand Tesla, beyond the headlines in mainstream media, beyond the you're going to hear, certainly beyond all these smart asses at the dinner table who think they know better. Join us over at patreon.com/tomall nash. Join our 28,000 members. Be a part of the change. Be a part of the Tesla girl story. There's still a lot more to be told here. Don't let the BS gaslight you on Mia. And I'll see you on the next one. Peace."
