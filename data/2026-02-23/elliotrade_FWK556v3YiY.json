    "transcript": "Heat.   Heat.   Heat.  Hey, heat. Hey, heat.   Yeah.   Heat.   M.  Mm.   Heat.   Hey. Hey. Hey.   What's  going  on  everybody  and  welcome   back  to  my  first  video  in  quite  a  while.   I  was  very  very  sick  last  week.  So,  if  I   sound  a  little  under  the  weather,  well,   I  am  a  bit,  but  I  honestly  cannot  wait   to  make  this  video  because  the  world  is   changing  very  fast.  And  as  we  said  over   the  last  couple  of  months,  this  channel   is  going  to  be  changing  a  lot  with  it.   And  today  is  going  to  be  on  the  topic  of   AI  pretty  much  eating  everything  in  the   economy  right  now  that  looks  like   software.  AI  is  destroying  the  economy   as  we  know  it.  That  is  the  sentiment  and   that  is  the  reality  if  you  look  at  the   stock  market  and  we  can  show  you  literal   proof  that  AI  is  creating  hundreds  of   billions  of  dollars  in  losses  on  a   regular  basis  from  the  stock  market.  And   it  is  not  just,  you  know,  vague   intuition.  It  is  not  a  potential  future   consequence.  This  is  really  what's   happening.  Now,  is  it  happening  because   there's  been  tremendous  job  loss  or  is   it  happening  because  people  are  worried   about  job  loss?  That  is  the  question   that  we're  going  to  be  talking  a  little   bit  about.  But  right  now,  I  want  to  make   the  case  for  you.  And  I'm  going  to  be   putting  out  a  full  recorded  video  on   this  tomorrow  that  AI  is  a  huge  reason   why  Bitcoin  is  struggling.  And  it's  not   just  because  the  marginal  dollars  are   being  invested  in  more  exciting  AI   companies,  but  it's  because  AI  is   destroying  anything  that  is  software   related.  And  when  it  comes  down  to  it,   we  have  seen  that  Bitcoin  trades  much   more  in  lock  step  with  software  than   with  gold,  than  with  the  NASDAQ,  than   with  anything  else.  It  is  pretty  much   software  as  it's  considered  by  the  big   boys.  So  when  we  look  at  the  future  of   investing,  when  we  look  at  the  current   climate,  we  have  to  ask  ourselves,  is   this  bare  euphoria  or  is  this  a  change   in  the  world  that  we're  experiencing?   And  right  now,  does  it  make  any   difference?  Because  the  charts  are   screaming  very  obviously  one  thing,   which  that  AI  is  here  to  change  the   world  and  it  is  devouring  everything  in   its  path.  Check  it  out.  Uh  there  is  a   lot  I  said  250K.  Yeah,  I  did.  I  said  a   lot  of  things  in  the  in  the  bull  market.   We  are  no  longer  in  a  bull  trend.   Thank  you.  I  hope  I'm  feeling  better   soon,  too.  AI  is  not  the  problem.  I'm   misleading  people.  Okay.  All right.   Well,  if  you  think  AI  is  not  the   problem,  and  it's  just  me  misleading   people,  then  you  enjoy  uh  your  thesis  on   reality  because  today  we're  going  to  be   showing  you  the  facts.  Check  this  out.   Uh  Bitcoin  has  been  in  freef  fall   obviously  since  the  markets  open  on   Sunday  evening.  Sunday  evening  is  the   beginning  of  CME  opening  for  futures  the   next  day  and  we  saw  this  huge  gap  down   and  Bitcoin  lost  this  sort  of  semi-   meaningful  not  really  meaningful  level   of  65k  it's  not  not  a  huge  level  here  uh   it's  a  mid  level  but  really  what's   happening  is  this  we  have  a  combination   of  an  article  written  by  someone  named   Catrini  now  Catrini  is  let  me  go  ahead   and  make  this  just  a  little  bit  smaller   here.   Catrini  is  an  analyst  on  Twitter  and  put   out  this  like  fictional  or  I  don't  know   how  to  call  it  like  anything  other  than   a  fanfiction  post.  It  was  a  hypothetical   post  that  Catrini  put  out  here.  Let  me   just  make  this  a  little  small.  There  we   go.  Okay.  So,  Catrini  put  out  a  post   that  effectively  argued  that  in  2028   we're  going  to  see  this  massive  dump.   I'm  just  going  to  show  you  the  original   article  here.  Okay.  This  is  the  Catrini   research  article.  Okay,  he  says  2028  the   global  intelligence  crisis  and  he  says   what  follows  is  a  scenario  not  a   prediction.  So  this  is  not  something   he's  saying  is  happening  now  but  Catrini   is  just  a  very  high  signal  account   followed  by  a  lot  of  other  high  signal   accounts.  This  is  uh  we  we'll  cover   punch  in  a  second  here,  but  essentially   this  is  just  the  way  Twitter  works  is   there's  a  few  really  sharp  people  that   will  sometimes  put  out  some  information   that  has  a  ripple  effect  on  the  rest  of   the  investing  world  because  Twitter   really  is  the  source  of  where   information  starts  and  spreads.  Okay,  so   there's  a  Catrini  AI  doomer  fiction  post   that  comes  out.  We  have  word  that   Deepseek  is  distilling  some  information   from  Anthropic  and  this  comes  from   Anthropic  itself.  We'll  talk  about  that.   We  have  uh  tariffs  being  set  back  as   well  as  potential  strikes  in  Iran  as   well  as  now  some  conflict  down  in  Mexico   as  well  as  potential  conflict  in  Taiwan.   Uh  and  this  poster  says  happy  Monday.   And  effectively  what  we're  seeing  is   that  all  markets  right  now,  all  markets   are  just  feeling  absolute  shock  waves.   And  I  know  a  lot  of  people  especially   even  just  here  at  the  beginning  of  this   episode  in  the  chat  were  saying  that   they  don't  believe  that  this  is  fully   related  to  AI.  Well,  watch  this.  We  see   here  that  just  a  few  moments  ago,  let  me   see  if  I  can  find  this  here.  Um,   where  is  the  Tradfi  post?  Yes,  this.   Okay,  so  Anthropic  put  out  a  post  uh   just  yesterday  or  this  morning  where   they  said  that  Cloud  Code  can  automate   Cobalt,  which  is  uh  I  didn't  know  what   that  was,  but  apparently  it  is  a  I  saw  a   tweet  actually  breaking  this  down.  I   lost  it.  But  essentially,  it's  an  old   system.  That's  what  the  IRS  and  other,   you  know,  legacy  government  systems  are   based  off  of,  which  apparently  IBM  owns   that  market.  Well,  instantly,  instantly,   what  we  saw  is  IBM  crash  minus  uh  almost   10%  or  over  10%.  So,  you're  seeing  these   happen  in  real  time  where  effectively  AI   is  directly  impacting  the  economy.  Uh   yesterday  it  was  that  cloud  code  was   cyber  sec  can  intermediate  cyber   security  or  programmatically  attack   cyber  security  and  you  have  cyber   security  companies  dumping  uh  just  over   the  last  few  months  it  was  the  SAS   apocalypse  right  anything  that  was   software  as  a  service  and  so  if  you  say   that  AI  isn't  affecting  the  economy   today  I  would  argue  that  that  that's  not   accurate  in  fact  what  we've  seen  is  that   uh  this  article  um  of  course  this  is  all   based  on  this  step  function  in  AI   productivity  if  you  guys  have  been   following  the  actual  new  models   specifically  claude  opus  4.6  came  out  2   weeks  after  GPT  5.2  and  you  see  an   exponential  trend  here  or  as  QW  uh  says   here  we  have  a  exponential  on  a  log   chart  which  is  a  double  exponential  and   that's  the  pace  of  increase  on  AI's   actual  productivity.  So  this  is  what's   happening  is  AI  is  actually  uh   destroying  things  in  the  economy  not   creating  all  this  excitement  because   we're  at  the  phase  now  where  it's   getting  so  good  that  it's  threatening   knowledge  work  and  that  is  the  core   issue  here  is  that  knowledge  workers  are   a  huge  part  of  the  economy  and  if  they   get  put  out  of  work  the  actual  spending   within  econ  within  the  larger  economy   will  suffer.  So  there  was  this  piece   here  by  Catrini  where  effectively  I'm   going  to  walk  you  through  the  thesis   here  is  he  says  effectively  what's   happening  is  that  we  have  uh  he  he's   just  having  a  fanfiction  here.  He's   saying  the  year  is  2028  and  he's  he   makes  the  case  that  at  first  what  will   happen  here  is  SAS  companies  software   companies  will  fire  a  lot  of  people  and   start  automating  everything  with  AI.   they  will  then  pump  because  the  markets   will  say,  \"Oh,  these  companies  are   actually  still  making  a  significant   amount  of  money  and  they  actually  have   compressed  their  margins.  So  effectively   they  don't  have  to  spend  as  much  money   on  staff.  So  now  they're  actually  much   pro  more  profitable.  But  eventually  the   things  that  they're  automating,  the   doctors,  the  lawyers,  the  knowledge   workers,  which  are  the  highest  paid   people  in  society,  end  up  being  out  of   work.  And  that  has  huge  rippling  effects   because  all  of  a  sudden  tons  of  loans   that  were  written  for  companies  that   were  doing  recurring  revenue,  those   loans  all  of a  sudden  start  becoming   bad.  Mortgages  that  were  written  to   highquality  borrowers  that  were  working   at  highquality  jobs  as  lawyers,  doctors,   accountants,  knowledge  workers,  those   start  to  default.  Right?  So  this  is  the   thesis,  right?  Again,  this  is  not   reality  that  we're  living  in.  This  is   the  idea  of  what  could  happen  over  the   next  few  years.  Now,  of  course,  I  want   to  underline  it's  never  as  bad  as  it   looks.  And  this  is  most  likely  going  to   be  very  very  wrong  in  many  many  ways.   But  what's  happening  right  now  is  this   one  article  sparked  uh  it  sparked  this   collapse.  Oh,  this  is  the  uh  explanation   of  the  cobalt  uh  uh  language  by  ICO   beast  here.  He  essentially  says  uh   cobalt  is  what  a  giant  portion  of  legacy   federal  systems  are  based  off  based  off   of  including  IRS,  DoD,  etc.  Anyway,  um   there  was  a  nice  I  got  my  tabs  mixed  up   here,  but  I  wanted  to  show  the  actual   impact  here.  Okay,  so  credit  card  stocks   now  because  of  this  piece  just   absolutely  dumped.  And  you  can  see  here   Visa,  Mastercard,  American  Express,   Capital  One  instantly  dumped  because  of   a  fictional  a  fictional  theory  within   this  Catrini  piece.  Right?  So  you  have   this  Satrini  piece  puts  out  this  idea   that  okay  maybe  this  would  be  bad  uh  for   these  companies  because  he  theorizes   that  once  the  world  becomes  agentically   driven  these  agents  will  actually   transact  on  stable  coins  they  won't  use   Mastercard  or  Visa  and  so  their  revenues   will  compress.  So,  it's  very   interesting,  right?  Um,  you  also  have  uh   Door  Dash  and  these  other  things  dumping   because  the  idea  is  that  people  will   spend  less  money  if  they're  not  getting   paid  as  much  as  knowledge  workers.  The   the  people  who  were  getting  the  free   lunch  at  Meta  for  being  knowledge   workers.  Those  people  in  the  marketing   department,  the  uh  lawyers,  the   accountants,  all  all  of  the  knowledge   workers  were  the  ones  spending   frivolously,  keeping  the  economy  afloat,   uh  Uber  eating  all  their  meals,  and   effectively  keeping  the  velocity  of   money  high.  Right?  It's  that  top  portion   of  earners  that  are  being  affected  most   by  all  of  this.  And  so  when  people   extrapolate  out  and  say  all  this  stuff   is  going  to  get  automated  away,  that  is   precisely  what  is  so  scary  about  this   moment.  Okay,  so  that's  what's  happening   right  now  is  that  AI  dumerism  is  maybe   maybe  reaching  a  fever  pitch.  There's  an   argument  that  right  now  we're  seeing  the   pico  top  of  AI  dumerism  and  that  we  will   see  things  normalize  because  the  world   simply  never  moves  as  fast  as  we  hope  or   imagine  it  might.  I  think  one  of  the   best  charts  that  I've  seen  is  this  one   and  it  really  underscores  just  how   absolutely  far  ahead  we  are  as  people   living  sort  of  terminally  online.  Miles   tweeted  this.  He  said  84  uh%  of  the   planet  has  never  used  AI.  If  you're  on   crypto  Twitter  or  if  you're  on  Twitter   in  general  or  investing  Twitter,  we   should  just  rename  it  to  investing   Twitter  because  we're  not  exclusively   looking  at  crypto  anymore.  The  crypto   world  is  being  so  deeply  affected  by   everything  else  that  you  have  to  be   focused  on  those  other  things.  And  quite   frankly,  there's  just  not  enough  to  be   interested  in  crypto  as  100%  of  the   activities  anymore.  It's  just  a  reality.   Uh  so  84%  of  the  world  has  never  used   AI.  Only.3%  have  a  paid  subscription  and   only  04%  have  ever  vibe  coded  your  early   act  like  it.  This  is  very  much  so  one  of   those  charts  that  level  sets  because  if   you're  online  it  might  seem  like   everyone  and  their  grandma  is  using   OpenClaw  is  automating  every  workflow  is   becoming  superhuman  cyborg  and  is   somehow  managed  to  change  their   investment  portfolios  to  predict  the   next  seven  steps  of  AI  dumerism  wiping   out  the  world.  That  is  not  the  case.  The   real  the  the  real  case  the  reality  is   that  we  are  in  this  tiny  tiny  fraction   of  people  who  are  at  the  source  of   information  who  are  watching  things   almost  in  real  time  as  they're  happening   and  almost  in  a  predictive  lens.  A  lot   of  times  I  seem  to  think  that  we're   living  in  the  future  at least  a  few   months  and  sometimes  even  a  few  years   being  in  this  terminally  online  world  of   investing  because  the  whole  point  of   investing  is  to  predict  the  future  not   to  understand  the  present.  And  so  to  be   a  good  investor  is  to  be  predictive.  And   looking  at  this  chart,  it's  very  clear   that  we  are  in  the  tiny  tiny  minority  of   people  using  AI,  wrestling  with  the  true   implications  of  AI  at  scale  and   understanding  how  it's  going  to  impact   everyone.  So  as  much  as  it  feels  like   there's  this  fever  pitch  of  uh  dumerism,   it's  still  very  early  in  this  uh  in  this   world  and  vibe  coding  and  AI  has  not   swept  and  changed  the  world  yet.  Now,   could  it  over  the  next  few  years?  Yes.   And  these  types  of  step  functions  like   we're  seeing  um  like  you're  seeing   Bellagi  highlight  here.  This  is  non  like   this  is  absolutely   non-negligible.  This  is  a  massive   massive  step  change  like  what  we've  seen   over  the  last  few  weeks  and  months.  But   it  is  not  in  and  of  itself  the  signal   that  everything  is  different.  But  what   we  are  witnessing  might  be  that   inflection  point.  But  it  is  interesting   that  one  article  here  you  have  this  one   literally  it  says  a  fictional  it  says  at   the  top  like  this  is  a  scenario  this  is   fiction  and  you  see  that  it's  actually   wiping  out  significant  chunks  of  value   from  the  stock  market  we  are  in  a  very   unusual  time  a  very  unusual  time  and  so   it's  important  to  realize  that  crisis   which  is  what  it  feels  like  we're  in   we're  in  this  crisis  of  AI  dumerism  it   will  bring  up  massive  opportunities  but   it's  also  important  to  realize  that   those  opportunities  might  not  be  today   And  it's  important  to  remain  a  little   bit  patient.  We're  going  to  be  talking   about  the  charts  and  the  obvious  things   happening  uh  in  those  charts  in  just  a   second.  Um  but  yeah,  exactly.  Uh  people   can't  afford  bread.  How  are  they   supposed  to  pay  for  an  AI  subscription?   I  agree.  I'm  not  saying  the  solution  is   for  them  to  pay  for  AI.  I'm  just  saying   that  most  people  haven't  even  used  the   free  tooling,  84%  of  people.  So  to  say   they  can't  pay  for  bread  is  the  reason,   that's  not  it.  There's  just  not  even   curiosity  by  the  vast  majority  of   people.  And  then  even  for  the  people  who   have  used  AI,  they  haven't  even   subscribed  to  the  premium  version,  which   is  nine  bucks  a  month  or  whatever.  I   don't  think  that  $9  a  month  is  the   reason  why  people  haven't  subscribed  to   AI.  I  think  it's  that  we  live  in  a  very   very  small  minority  of  people  who  are   focused  on  the  deepest  level  of  tech   advancement  and  how  it's  going  to  infect   uh  affect  investments  uh  or  infect   investments  as  I  accidentally  just  said.   Um   let's  get  to  this.  Uh  once  again  here  is   Bitcoin  overlaid  on  the  expanded  tech   software  ETF  by  iShares.  Obviously  the   percentages  are  different  here.  Uh   Bitcoin  went  up  way  more  in  percentage   since  2018,  right?  But  directionally   they  are  mostly  in  a  bull  run  or  a  bare   market  almost  to  the  day,  right?  You  can   see  that  the  expanded  tech  software  ETF   uh  bottomed  sorry  that  it  bottomed   almost  exactly  on  the  day  that  Bitcoin   bottomed  in  November  of  2022.  and  it  was   up  for  almost  exactly  the  same  amount  of   time  with  almost  identical  peaks   throughout.  Right?  So,  you  could  say,   \"Oh,  wow.  These  are  just  not  the  same   chart,  but  they  look  really  similar,   right?  They  look  very,  very  similar  when   you  compare  software  as  a  whole  to  how   Bitcoin  has  traded,  especially  in  this   recent  runup.  But  also  look  in  2022  or   2021  rather  they  traded  pretty  similarly   as  well  with  this  March  peak  or  a  May   peak  and  then  you  had  a  a  late  2021  peak   as  well.  It's  not  that  different,  right?   It's  not  that  different.  Narratives  were   different,  but  the  actual  trading   velocity,  momentum,  and  then  eventual   draw  downs  were  not  insanely  different,   right?  So  it's  it  is  something  to   consider.  It's  something  to  consider,   okay?  That  these  things  are  very  very   similarly  treated  by  the  larger   investment  capital  out  in  the  world.  And   that  speaks  to  the  way  that  institutions   view  Bitcoin.  And  so  when  we  look  at,   hey,  there's  an  article  that  wipes  out   uh  for  example,  this  was  not  just  the   only  example  of  this.  We  have  here  two   days  ago  that  Claude  put  out  a  a  tweet   saying  they  are  introducing  Claude  code   security.  And  look  at  the  reaction.   Crowd  Strike  down,  Cloudflare  down,   PaloAlto  Networks  down,  Zcaler  down.  So   you  can  see  here  there's  a  a  knee-jerk   reaction  happening  by  institutional   capital.   when  these  things  are  put  out  in  the   world  that  there's  a  new  innovation  from   claude.  So  the  world  is  running  scared   from  software.  It's  running  scared  from   the  thing  that  has  powered  the  recent   runup  in  the  S&P  and  the  NASDAQ  that  has   been  one  of  the  most  magnificent  runs  in   the  history  of  the  American  economy.  And   we  are  also  we  are  also  at  a  stage  where   I  should  say  and  and  I  think  this  is   very  important  for  us  to  acknowledge   here.  We're  at  a  stage  where  you  have   this  the  largest  amount  of  retail   capital  inflows  in  history  in  the  stock   market.  Okay.  Retail  investors  bought  a   record  48  billion  in  US  equities  in  the   21-day  period  ending  last  week.  Let  me   read  that  again.  Retail  investors  bought   $ 48  billion  in  stocks  in  21  days.  Okay,   this  exceeds  the  previous  record  set   during  the  April  2025  crash  by  $5   billion.  And  by  comparison,  they  bought   $33  billion  at  the  beginning  of  2022   before  the  bare  market  hit.   Subsequently,  they  sold  nearly  10   billion  near  the  end  of  the  2022  bare   market.  Never  in  history  have  mom  and   pop  investors  rushed  to  buy  so  uh  just   to  buy  so  intensely.  How  does  this  end?   So,  what  you  see  here  is  a  stock  market   that  the  bigger  investors  are  risking   off  from  that  you  have  true  genuine   fears  of  AI  wiping  things  out.  And   meanwhile,  retail,  mom  and  pop,  and   likely  the  types  of  investors  that  are   going  to  be  most  heavily  affected  by  the   knowledge  worker  uh  recession,  if  you   will,  if  there  is  one,  if  we  end  up   losing  a  lot  of  knowledge  workers,  which   I  think  is  at  the  very  baseline   reasonable,  that  there  will  be  less   knowledge  workers  because  of  AI   automation.  I  mean,  most  businesses  can   now  start  replacing  at  least  low-level   knowledge  workers.  Say  you  have  a   marketing  intern  or  someone  running   social  media,  making  social  media  posts.   Well,  guess  what?  You  can  definitely   automate  some  of  those  images,  some  of   that  media  creation  with  uh  AI,  at least   right  now.  You  don't  have  to  go  all   crazy  and  say  you're  going  to  replace   your  doctor,  but  at least  some  level  of   knowledge  workers  are  being  replaced.   And  meanwhile,  you  have  the  retail   investors,  which  are  generally   considered  genuinely  or  uh  generally   considered  sick  brain  right  now,  but   generally  considered  less  sophisticated   at  the  highest  levels  of  investment  into   the  stock  market.  So,  I  think  that  you   have  a  recipe  for  some  kind  of  sell-off   happening  here.  And  it's  just  that  we  as   smart  investors  need  to  figure  out  how   to  be  on  the  right  side  of  this.  Now,  I   want  to  be  clear.  I  think  that  AI   dumerism  is  in  some  ways  brain  rot.  Like   I  think  that  there  is  a  real  genuine   brain  rot  that's  happening  because  on   the  other  side  of  this  if  it's  true  that   AI  and  robotics  are  going  to  make  uh   knowledge  work  and  physical  work  totally   almost  free  or  the  marginal  cost  goes  to   zero  well  then  you  could  probably  build   a  house  for  very  very  cheaply  and  you'll   probably  be  able  to  feed  your  family   extremely  cheaply.  So  the  basics  of   life,  health  care,  housing,  education,   those  might  go  down  and  trend  down  to   being  almost  zero  dollars,  right?  Or  or   very  very  very  cheap.  So,  how  to  live  a   highquality  life  or  a  life  that  has  its   basic  necessities  so  that  you  can  raise   your  family  that  might  actually  become   extraordinarily  cheap  and  you  might  not   need  to  spend  your  whole  life  working   like  a  dog  to  just  have  the  basics  of,   you  know,  a  modern  life.  That  that  is   eventually  what  I  think  this  is  going   towards.  But  at  at  the  beginning,  what's   going  to  happen  is  we  have  an  economy   that's  not  wired  that  way  that  will  have   a  lot  of  freakouts.  And  I  think  what   we're  seeing  is  just  the  emotional   reaction  to  uh  tech  advancing  this  fast.   So  it's  important  that  you  realize   whether  you  agree  with  this  or  not  as  to   why  it's  happening.  It's  just  just   acknowledge  it's  happening.  Claude  puts   out  a  tweet  and  the  whole  market  of  one   sector  dumps.  These  aren't  coincidences.   These  are  just  very  very  connected   facts.  And  so  AI  right  now  is  as  much  as   it  has  been  exciting  watching  it  run  up,   it  is  now  actually  having  a  net  negative   effect  on  significant  sectors  of  the   economy.  You  might  say  that  that's  a   good  thing.  Who  knows?  Uh  a  good  uh  I   saw  this  one  tweet.  I  thought  it  was   pretty  uh  pretty  bang  on,  but   essentially   um  uh  Tennorus  says  all  of  these  are  eff   gigaf,  you  know,  Grammarly,  Calendarly,   Mirro,  Ren  tool,  like  all  of  these  like   basic  automation  uh  workflow  tools.  Um   and  then  he  says  just  normal  FT,  you   have  Accenture  into  it,  you  know,  the   enterprise  softwares  that  are  probably   still  going  to  be  harder  to  vibe  code.   And  his  whole  assumptions  are  coding   agents  keep  getting  better,  software   keeps  getting  cheaper,  personal  agents   will  work  and  proliferate.  everyone  has   access  to  equivalent  uh  of  compute   full-time  PA  and  labs  increasingly  enter   the  application  layer  meaning  that  the   actual  frontier  uh  LLMs  like  claude  like   open  AI  like  Gemini  are  going  to  start   making  the  applications  themselves   because  they  don't  need  people  to  have   an  application  layer  on  top.  I  think   this  is  true.  I  think  that  the  base  of   the  AI  doesn't  need  to  be  fed  through  an   application  to  make  it  useful  if  the  AI   is  just  better.  So  this  is  where  I  do   think  that  the  assumptions  are  pretty   right  is  that  uh  people  building   applications  on  top  of  AI.  I  think  it's   very  very  tenuous  because  eventually   people  will  either  be  able  to  build   their  own  applications  or  the  AI  won't   need  an  application.  You  can  just  talk   to  it  and  just  say  hey  can  you  do  my   taxes  and  it'll  say  cool  yeah  give  me   this  information  you  give  it  and  then  it   does  it  right.  Uh  you  don't  need  a  whole   interface  just  for  that.  So  I  think   people  will  make  some  money  in  the  short   term  but  I  don't  think  that  it's  it's   sustainable  personally.  Um  and  then  I   guess  the  more  scary  part  is  what  if   this  is  you  know  what  Mano  brought  here.   I  think  this  is  again  doomerism.  I  don't   buy  into  it.  But  what  if  this  is in  the   prop  process  of  topping  forever?  Retail   jamming  every  last  cent  into  the  US   equity  market  at  the  peak  valuations   right  before  they  start  losing  their   jobs  to  AI  and  the  employment  rate   structurally  bottoms.  Maybe.  Maybe.  Um  I   don't  know.  I  I  think  that  what  we'll   see  now  now  is  that  we're  seeing  the   bare  trend  either  it's  reaching  its   euphoria  because  it  feels  very  strong  or   it  will  have  another  few  legs.  And  we   just  need  to  understand  and  have  a   humility  about  understanding  that  this   is  a  new  thing  and  that  these  new  trends   can  be  very  powerful  because  you  have  a   lot  of  people  around  the  world  buying   into  this  not  based  on  vague  hypium  but   based  on  real  results  real  outputs  and   so  uh  whether  this  is  the  middle  of  the   bare  market  or  whether  we're  at  the   bottom  we  will  find  out.  Um  and  I  don't   think  that  you  need  to  be  a  hero.  I   think  that  it's  quite  likely  that  we   could  be  at  the  bottom.  I  mean  Bitcoin   dumped  but  not  that  much  right?  It's   still  still  in  this  range.  You  could  see   this  as  maybe  even  is  this  a  failed   breakdown?  It's  not  a  serious  breakdown   from  65K.  Um  but  then  when  you  zoom  out,   it's  just  it's  just  limp.  It's  just   flaccid.  Doesn't  seem  like  it  wants  to   pump  yet.  Um  but  that  could  change.  That   could  easily  change.  Uh  we'll  talk  about   that  because  I  don't  think  that  we're   seeing  quite  what  we  want  to  see  right   now  with  stuff  like  this  coming  out.  Uh   one  of  the  oldest  Satoshi  era  wallets   just  sold  1.24  billion  holding  since   2009.  This  is  the  stuff  that  bothers  me,   right?  Um  because  you  have  wallets  that   survived  many  cycles  now  deciding  now's   the  time  they  want  to  get  out.  So  it   does  feel  as  much  as  it  we  want  to   scream  bottoms  in  bottoms  in  it  does   feel  like  just  having  a  patient  mindset   and  just  saying  okay  why  don't  we  just   say  the  bottoms  in  when  we  at  least   start  seeing  a  reversal  of  the  charts   just  there's  no  reason  to  be  heroic   about  this  because  if  it's  true  that  AI   will  have  this  like  massively   destructive  effect  to  software  well  we   might  not  be  at  the  end  of  that  it  might   just  be  you  know  stocks  are  at  pretty   much  all-time  highs  so  I  don't  think   there's  any  reason  to  rush  into  a  thesis   uh  because  eventually  I  do  think  that   you  will  see  the  need  to  print  money   again.  You  will  see  that  the  cries  for   UBI  or  redistribution  of  capital  from  AI   will  become  uh  they'll  reach  a  fever   pitch.  You'll  see  that  the  need  for  a   renegotiation  of  how  things  work  will   will  happen  and  um  and  you'll  see  that   things  like  uh  social  security  which  are   running  out  of  money  uh  things  like  that   will  need  to  get  funded  and  usually  the   only  way  they  know  how  to  do  that  is   with  the  money  printer.  So,  I  don't   think  there's  any  reason  to  rush  into   massive  positions  right  now.  I  think  we   should  just  keep  analyzing  and   monitoring  the  situation  and  remembering   just  remember  like  most  people  aren't   doing  this.  You  are  in  the  tiny  tiny   fraction  of  people.  You  are in  the  red   dot,  right?  You  are  in  this  red  dot.  Um,   if  you  are  in  crypto  and  you  are  focused   on  this  right  now,  uh,  you  are  in  the   04%  of  the  population.  Um,  and  I  highly   encourage  everyone  to  be  vibe  coding  and   stuff.  I  don't  think  it's  going  to   change  your  life.  I  don't  think  vibe   coding  is  something  that  is  going  to   give  you  this  massive  leg  up  on  the  rest   of  society  because  I  do  think  that  it   will  all  be  right  in  your  phone.  That's   what  Siri  will  be  within  the  next,  you   know,  year  or  two.  But  I  do  think  that   understanding  where  the  world  is  going,   using  the  tools,  and  not  just  uh   focusing  on  second  and  third-hand   sources,  what  other  people  think,  but   drawing  your  own  conclusions  will  help   you  navigate  the  storm.  Uh  and  that's   where  I  think  that  most  of  us  should   approach  all  this  with  a  curiosity.  And   even  though  it  feels  like  the  bear   dumerism  is  reaching  this  fever  pitch,   don't  give  in  to  the  raw  emotion  because   the  raw  emotion  won't  let  you  think   clearly.  And  I  do  believe  that  the   people  who  think  clearly  over  the  next   year  or  two  will  end  up  holding  on  to   assets  that  will  dominate  not  just  for   the  next  few  years  but  probably  for   decades  to  come.  So  it's  going  to  be  an   exciting  time  and  uh  I  do  think  this  is   one  of  my  core  thesis  which  is  this  is   Palmer  Lucky.  Uh  he  is  the  head  of   Andril.  Uh,  Andreil  is  one  of  these  very   exciting  new  AI  uh  new  military  defense   tech  companies  and  I  will  show  you  what   he  has  to  say.  And  this  is  essentially   my  um  what  I  was  trying  to  say  on  the   last  few  episodes.   The  the  the  biggest  beneficiaries  of   vibe  coding  are  going  to  be  the  hardware   nerds  like  me.  It's  going  to  be  it's   going  to  be  the  the  the  shape  rotators   uh  not  the  word  cells.   So  this  is  an  interesting  take  and  I   think  this  is  totally  true  which  is  that   the  future  is  going  to  be  much  more   beneficial  for  those  who  are  doing   physical  things  and  I  think  that  the   intersection  of  AI  with  crypto  is  where   the  most  exciting  stuff  happens  but  then   where  you  look  at  the  actual   beneficiaries  of  AI  I  think  that  you'll   see  that  a  lot  of  these  overseas  cheaper   models  let  me  see  find  this  because  this   actually  um  this  actually  came  up  today   but  a  lot  of  these  AI  models  even   anthropic,  right,  are  being  threatened   by  being  um  attacked  through  where  is   this  article?  I  have  way  too  many  tabs   open.   Uh   okay,   check  this  out.   So,  if  you're  anthropic,  imagine  you  you   are  anthropic  right  now.  you've  built   the  best  AI  in  the  world.  Well,  guess   what?  We  just  found  out  that  they're   responding  to  the  fact  that  they've  been   getting  farmed,  right?  They've  been   getting  farmed  by  open-source  AIs  from   Chinese  labs,  right,  across  tens  of   thousands  of  accounts  used  for  something   called  distillation.  Distillation  is   where  they  have  the  their  AIS  interact   with  Claude  and  reverse  engineer  how   Claude  works,  how  Claude  thinks  to   essentially  steal  Claude's,  you  know,   value  and  train  it  so  that  their  AIs  are   now  getting  better,  getting  to  be  just   as  good  as  Claude,  right?  And  so  it  was   widely  speculated  this  was  happening,   but  the  scale  is  staggering.  Honestly,   amazed  that  it  took  Anthropic  this  long   to  clamp  down  on  this.  Explains  why  they   are  locking  down  API  usage,  right?  So   this  is  the  defensive  modes  of  AI  are   unfortunately  very  blurry  right  because   you  have  these  premier  frontier  models   like  anthropic  like  open  AI  like  Gemini   and  then  you  have  the  open-  source   Chinese  competitive  models  like  Kimmy   Miniax  GLM  and  what's  happening  is  the   gap  seems  to  not  be  significant  because   every  time  there's  a  leap  forward  in  in   Opus  there  is  a  similar  leap  forward  uh   by  Qen  or  one  of  the  open  source  models   and  so  I  guess  it's  really  hard  for  me   to  see  Even  investing  at  these  insanely   high  valuations,  you  know,  half  a   trillion  dollars  for  Anthropic,  almost  a   trillion  dollars  for  OpenAI,  you  know,   several  trillion  dollars  for  Nvidia.   They're  these  are  these  massive  massive   valuations.  And  maybe  they'll  be  val   maybe  they'll  be  defensible.  But  it's   possible  that  intelligence  becomes   widely  distributed  and  as  common  as   oxygen  and  water  and  that  maybe  it's  the   physical  things  that  are  used  in  the   byproduct  of  those  intelligence  that  are   much  harder  to  compete  with  like   robotics,  like  the  shape  rotators.  And   that's  kind  of  my  base  theory  for  how  to   approach  the  next  era,  which  is  what   can't  be  easily  cloned.  And  this  is  an   era  where  I  think  that  if  you  understand   the  thing  after  the  thing,  as  I've  heard   a  lot  of  investors  say,  they're  like,   \"Oh,  the  thing  right  now  is  AI,  but  the   thing  after  the  thing  is  robotics,  is   embodied  AI,  is  the  shape  rotators,  the   physical  world.\"  Uh,  and  it  goes  in   tandem  with  Peter  Teal's  theory  that  we   have  had  decades  of  focusing  on  the   world  of  bits,  the  digital  world,  and   now  we're  going  to  sort  of  rotate  back   to  the  world  of  atoms  and  have  the  value   created  in  the  digital  world  start  to   feed  the  the  value  of  the  of  the   physical  world  because  the  public   transportation  around  you  hasn't   improved  at  the  rate  that  your   smartphone  has.  Uh,  so  it's  just  an   interesting  time  in  history.  Actually,   as  much  as  it's  freaky  and  there's   dumerism,  there's  all  this  stuff  to   worry  about,  there  is  all  this  stuff  to   be  excited  about  and  we  are  going  to   live  absolutely  insane  radical  lives   over  the  next  20  years  and  especially  if   you're  able  to  nail  a  few  of  these   pivots  in  the  market  and  understand   what's  about  to  grow  dramatically  in   value.  Um,  okay.  In  Bitcoin  specific   Bitcoin  specific  land,  uh,  we're  going   to  be  looking  at  uh  this  chart  which   hasn't  changed,  right?  We  had  this  one   pop  up  several  days  ago.  Remember,  we've   been  saying  essentially  72K  is  the  big   line.  It's  the  big  line  in  the  sand.  We   had  uh  let  me  actually  go  ahead  and  move   this  up  to  exactly  72K.  Uh  we  had  this   very  very  uh  anemic  bounce  over  it  right   here.  Unfortunately,  didn't  really  get   us  to  where  we  wanted  to  go.  I'm  going   to  change  this  to  be  blue.  And  ever   since  then,  it's  just  been  flaccid.  It's   been  more  flaccid  than  old  uh  old   grandpa  over  there.  Old  grandpa  without   his  pills.  And  that's  currently  just  the   state  of  affairs  with  Bitcoin.  And   that's  why  maybe  Bitcoin  hits  a  bottom   here  and  hits  an  inflection.  Maybe  it   just  chops  around  a  bit  more.  I  don't   think  we  need  to  be  freaking  out  about   it.  Don't  need  to  be  forcing  it  because   as  I  told  you,  we  have  other  charts  like   this  uh  like  gold,  which  I  told  you  I   was  going  to  be  reallocating  towards  if   we  broke  uh  5100.  We  did.  And  look  at  it   up  nicely  uh  over  5100.  Again,  we  will   see  how  this  goes.  The  all-time  high   here  was  5600.  But  as  we  see  headlines   like  what  we're  seeing  with  Iran,  like   what  we're  seeing  with  Mexico,  it's   very,  very  clear  that  gold  is  going  to   be  more  and  more  desirable,  especially   as  people  flock  to  safety.  Remember,   people  want  in  times  of  uncertainty  the   safest  thing.  There's  nothing  safer,   there's  nothing  more  dependable  than   gold.  and  gold  will  be  a  thing  that  very   clearly  will  benefit  from  all  of  these   sort  of  secular  trends  of  fear  of  tech,   fear  of  the  stocks  crashing,  fear  of   knowledge  workers  getting  uh  laid  off,   not  knowing  what's  going  on.  Gold   benefits  from  all  of  those  things.  And   so  I  don't  know  where  gold  ends  up,  but   I  know  that  it's  genuinely  bullish  what   we're  seeing,  and  then  seeing  it  reclaim   this  $5,100  level.  That  is  objectively   very  bullish  from  a  chart  perspective.   So  you  had  this  sort  of  uh  this  was  the   bottom  here  that  was  from  the  flash   crash  selloff.  the  top  before  the   exponential  breakout  and  then  we   couldn't  get  above  it.  Couldn't  get   above  it  and  then  now  we've  broken  it.   These  are  all  just  very  very  bullish   basic  technicals  uh  mixed  with  the   narrative  and  you  get  a  recipe  for  gold   which  will  probably  pull  other   commodities  up  with  it.  Uh  as  you  know   I've  been  very  bullish  on  copper  and   uranium.  Uh  uranium  not  having  uh  a   particularly  bullish  day  today.  Uh  but   copper  has  been  holding  pretty  nicely   here.  Just  kind  of  going  sideways  uh   over  the  last  few  uh  weeks  or  so.  Let's   get  this  onto  a  slightly  longer  chart.   Yeah,  Copper's  just  been  kind  of   bouncing  sideways.  Uh  nothing  major   going  on  here,  but  again,  Copper  is   going  to  be  one  of  the  main  bottlenecks,   right?  Where  regardless  of  whether  it's   QN  or  DeepSeek  or  OpenAI,  it  doesn't   matter  who  wins  the  intelligence  race.   All  of  these  models  need  data  centers,   they  need  processing,  and  those  need   energy.  And  so  if  you're  betting  on  the   bottlenecks,  the  data  processing   centers,  the  compute,  the  actual  energy,   those  are  interesting  places  that  I   think  once  again  they're  physical   things.  They  can't  be  vibecoded  and  they   are  needed  for  this  next  era.  Regardless   of  who  wins,  those  are  interesting   places  to  be  doing  business.  Um,  and  I   just  think  it's  okay  to  have  some  cash   right  now.  Like  you  do  not  have  to  have   a  position.  If  there  is  not  a  strong,   very  obvious  thing  to  bet  on,  you  don't   have  to  have  a  position.  And  that  is   okay.  Uh,  that  is  okay.  And  that  is   something  that  I  actually  have  uh  been   very  very very  positive  on  since  we  went   up  to  the  housekeeping  zone  of  just   having  some  cash  because  if  things  do   get  really  ugly  then  your  cash  is  going   to  go  really  really  far.  So  that's  the   that  was  the  goal  of  the  housekeeping   zone.   Uh  and  right  now  to  be  clear  even  though   gold  is  bullish  it's  not  like  insane.   It's  not  at  alltime  highs.  There's   nothing  that  is  insane  and  and  ex  like   so  exciting  you  need  to  stick  all  your   money  into  it  right  now.  So  having  some   cash  is  absolutely  a  good  plan.   Oh,  this  chart  was  pretty  insane.  The   emerging  markets  ETF.  Look  at  this.  Uh   20-year  high  of  55  bucks  got  rejected   back  in  February  of  21.  Made  its  way  up   and  uh  it's  been  durably  above  it  now.   So,  this  is  a  full-scale  blue  sky   breakout  on  the  uh  EM,  uh  Eyesshar's   Msei  Emerging  Markets,  emerging  index   fund.  This  type  of  stuff  is  interesting   and  I  think  this  is  just  more  about   capital  looking  to  rotate  away  from  the   S&P,  looking  to  rotate  away  from  uh   maybe  some  bloated  tech  names.  Uh  and  it   has  maybe  something  to  do  with  tariffs,   but  overall  you've  just  seen  emerging   markets  do  very  well  on  the  context  of   uncertainty,  capital  just  coming  home  to   different  markets.  It's  maybe  that's   just  the  simple  way  to  to  understand  it.   All  right,  now  for  cryptoland  because   let's  be  honest,  it  has  been  rough  in   cryptoland  and  today  was  unfortunately   another  blow  because  what  we  see  is  that   the  almost  70  uh  5%  like  over  70%   likelihood  of  the  Clarity  Act  getting   signed  into  law  just  got  dealt  a  blow   trading  as  low  as  36%  today.  That  is  not   what  we  want  to  see.  And  it  shows  that   the  gridlock  that  we're  seeing  around   crypto,  which  has  been  made  worse,  has   been  made  worse  by  the  collapse  of   prices,  well,  it  might  be  the  uh  part  of   the  sandwich  here  that  gets  this  law   pushed  back.  And  again,  the  Clarity  Act   is  needed  to  protect  this  industry.  uh   it  is  needed  to  protect  developers  in   this  industry  or  once  the  administration   switches  back  to  a  hostile  regime  which   it  feels  like  if  there  was  a  swing  back   to  the  Democrats  in  the  next  election  it   would  be  uh  this  is  not  good  right  so   this  is  definitely  playing  into  the   uncertainty  and  the  bearish  pressure  on   the  market   and  then  you  have  this  right  you  have   here's  here's  this  clip  I  want  to  just   play  it  you  guys  have  probably  seen  this   kid  clavvicular   He's  the  biggest  uh  he's  like  a  17  or  19   year old  kid  and  he  uh  the  looks  maxer   kid  and  he's  out  there.  Here's  what  he   has  to  say  about  Bitcoin.  So,  this  is   just  important  that  we  understand  where   things  sit  in  the  public's  eyes.   >> I  bet  half  the  people  are  on  suicide   watch.  Remember,  go  back  literally  uh  a   month  ago  when  me  and  Sneo  were   collabing,  sitting  at  the  restaurant   talking  about  Bitcoin  and  I'm  like,  \"Ah,   Bitcoin  is  dog  [ __ ]  Bitcoin  don't  trust   is  [ __ ]  garbage.  It's  a  horrible   investment.  And  everyone  in  the  chat's   like,  \"Bro  knows  nothing.  Bro's  a   [ __ ]  Like,  don't  listen  to  this  kid.   He's  got  no  idea.  Like,  vindicated.   Jesus.\"  Like,  you  guys  are  a  bunch  of   [ __ ]  clown  retards  for  buying  into   this  [ __ ]  Anyway,  this  is  uh  I  don't   agree  with  what  he  said  obviously,  but   it  just  shows  you  that  Bitcoin  could  not   have  a  worse  reputation  publicly  than  it   has  right  now.  And  Bitcoin  is  the  best   of  the  cryptoverse.  It's  the  best   performing  crypto  asset  in  history  and   it's  the  one  that  isn't  really   threatened  by  AI  the  same  way  these   other  crypto  assets  are.  I  think  Bitcoin   makes  a  lot  of  sense  in  an  era  of  AI.   However,  seeing  Satoshi  era  wallets  run   for  the  exits  is  concerning.  It's   concerning.  You  see  behaviors  that  you   haven't  seen  in  other  bare  markets.  It   is  concerning  and  we  just  need  to   recognize  that  the  public  opinion  is  not   on  crypto's  side.  I  think  as  crypto   investors,  we  need  to  see  ourselves  as   macro  investors  because  that  is  truly   the  basis  of  crypto  is  that  money   printing,  debasement,  understanding  the   Federal  Reserve,  understanding  the   forces  of  inflation  and  the  forces  of   that  surround  fiat  currency  is  why   Bitcoin  was  invented  and  understanding   how  things  may  change  throughout  the   world  of  AI,  the  era  of  AI  is  utterly   critical  to  continually  investing.  Uh,   this  was  a  good  take.  I  think  you  have   uh  Tyler  Deran  here  saying  he'd  like  to   buy  some  uh  coins,  some  crypto  when  this   cracks  16%.  Effectively,  this  is  a   stable  coin  index  showing  that  it's  only   right  now  at  about  11%.  This  is  USDT   plus  USDC  and  their  dominance.  Uh  and   you  can  see  here  that  the  all-time  high   was  about  a  little  over  16  maybe  17%.   So,  he's  saying  that  the  you  know  the   the  bottoming  zone  if  we  look  at  the   last  bare  market  would  be  a  little  bit   higher  here.  Uh,  I  think  that  these  are   good  macro  charts  to  look  at.  Although,   I  will  say  with  the  push  to  legalize   stable  coins  and  for  so  many  new  stable   coins  to  have  come  online  over  the  last   few  years,  it  very  well  might  be  that  at   least  uh  this  particular  metric,  we   might  see  an  all-time  high  on  it  because   there's  just  more  of  a  proliferation  of   this  particular  part  of  crypto  than  we   had  seen  even  in  2022.  Uh,  and  so   there's  possibilities  that  this  metric   will  go  higher.  I  just  want  to  say  that   doesn't  have  to  top  where  it  topped  last   time  because  there's  been  a  secular  push   towards  more  stable  coins.  Something  to   consider  as  we  look  at  this  metric,  but   I  do  think  it's  a  good  way  to   effectively  analyze  where  the  bottom   might  be.  Um,  in  other  news,  we  have   mortgages  hitting  the  lowest  rate  that   they've  been  in  in  many  years  here,  6%.   Um,  and  we  also  have  home  sellers  now   outnumbering  buyers  at  more  than   600,000,  the  largest  gap  ever  recorded.   This  to  me  is  the  beginning  of  what  we   will  see  with  a  housing  downturn,  right?   We  should  see  a  housing  downturn  here  um   in  the  next  year  or  so.  It  hasn't   happened  yet,  but  I  think  that  it  will   actually  be  one  of  the  biggest  net   positives  for  most  people  in  the  world,   right?  I  think  that  we  will  see  the   panic  over  valuations,  but  we  will  also   see  that  with  AI  and  robotics,  the   actual  amount  of  cost  of  hard  costs  to   build  a  house  may  trend  down  to  being   very,  very  low  over  the  next  10  years,   maybe  in  10  10  or  years.  I  have  no  idea   how  quickly  this  is  going  to  happen.  The   ability  to  like  3D  print  and  robotically   assemble  a  house  will  probably  get  to   the  point  where  it's  very  very  cheap.   And  in  that  world,  I  think  affording  an   amazing  house  for  your  family  may  become   widely  widely  accessible.  And  in  my   opinion,  that  would  be  one  of  the   biggest  steps  forward  for  humanity  so   that  everyone  can  be  included,  can  raise   a  family  safely,  not  have  to  worry  about   that.  That  would  be  an  absolute  gift  to   humanity.  So,  I  personally  hope  that  we   see  a  massive  housing  correction.  I  know   that  there  would  be  strain  on  the  banks   and  all  those  things  would  have  their   other  consequences.  But  let's  be  honest,   boomers  sitting  in  houses  that  they   bought  for  100k  and  now  trying  to  flip   them  for  multi-millions  and  they  own   multiple  properties,  vacation  houses,   they're  sitting  on  wealth  that  has   pretty  much  been  based  off  of  buying   properties  decades  ago  and  doing   nothing.  I  think  that  that  is  a  net   negative  for  society  as  a  whole.  I  don't   think  it's  added  to  the  nation's  value,   to  the  nation's  quality  of  life.  And  I   think  that  if  we  see  this  correct  for  at   least  millennials  and  zoomers,  it  would   be  an  amazing  gift  because  life  has   really  been  on  legendary  hard  mode  for   this  generation  with  the  cost  of   housing.  It  that  is  the  biggest  piece   that  has  prevented  I  think  a  lot  of   people  that  I  know  from  actually   settling  down  and  starting  families.   It's  just  so  hard  to  get  a  decent  house.   Hopefully  that  changes.   Crypto  is  done.  And  I  think  I  wasted  so   much  time  on  this  vaporware.  You  know,   the  reality  is  that  right  now,  uh,  it   feels  just  like  it  felt  in  2022  and  in   2018.  The  difference  is  that  we  as  an   industry  became  very  entitled  to   thinking  that  we  were  guaranteed  this   massive  bull  run,  that  we  were   guaranteed  this  massive  upside,  and  that   once  we  got  the  backing  of  the   presidential  administration,  the  the   flip  from  thinking  that  things  were   guaranteed  to  thinking  that  we're  still   this  like  underdog  industry  that's   trying  to  take  on  these  massive   behemoths.  I  think  that  that  flip  of   feeling  entitled  uh  which  is  something   I'm  totally  guilty  of  as  well.  I  think   that  that's  why  right  now  feels  so  bad.   But  I  lived  through  the  2018  bare   markets.  I  lived  through  the  2019  moment   and  it  was  a  ghost  town.  It  wasn't  even   people  weren't  even  angry.  People  were   just  not  even  here.  And  so  I  think  that   crypto  has  been  through  worse  and  that   it  will  find  its  way.  The  total   addressable  market,  the  TAM  for  crypto   is  absolutely  massive.  and  that  right   now  we're  seeing  a  changing  of  what  we   think  crypto  might  be  to  we're  seeing   the  actual  use  cases  evolve  to  what   crypto  will  eventually  be  and  I  can  tell   you  that  one  of  the  most  exciting  parts   about  this  is  that  this  whole  new  world   of  AI  of  agentic  commerce  of  agentic   building  it's  not  the  LLM  it's  the   agents  that  go  out  and  do  stuff  on   behalf  of  the  LLMs  and  they're  not  going   to  transact  on  Visa  and  Mastercard  they   are  not  going  to  transact  on  legacy   rails  they  will  transact  on  crypto  rails   how  that  translates  into  us  making   money.  We  haven't  seen  it  yet  and  it's  I   think  it's  foolish  to  try  to  overindex   on  what's  happening  today.  But  I  think   there  are  some  very  obvious  obvious  use   cases  for  crypto  that  will  start  to   become  very  clear  in  the  coming  days  and   not  not  in  the  coming  days  but  in  the   coming  months.  And  I  think  that  getting   overly  bearish  is  going  to  be  what   everyone  runs  to.  Um  but  right  now   you're  right.  I  think  that  the  space  has   become  very  difficult  to  allocate   capital  in.  Almost  everything's  draining   and  that  will  change  eventually,  but   it's  not  today  and  there's  no  reason  to   rush  into  it  today.  I  think  that  the   future  is  bright,  but  we  don't  need  to   rush  into  saying,  \"Oh,  we're  at  the   inflection  point.\"  But  here's  the  list   of  narratives  that  I  think  make  sense,   knowing  everything  we  know  today  about   crypto,  there  are  still  some  really   interesting  narratives.  One,  agentic   commerce  using  stable  coins  on  crypto   rails.  agents  go  and  transact  power  like   permissionlessly.  They  don't  need   intermediaries  and  they  don't  need   permission  from  these  big  centralized   financial  institutions.  That's  going  to   create  a  frictionless  economy.  Very   interesting.  So,  agentic  commerce.  The   second  privacy.  As  we're  seeing  with  all   of  the  inequality  and  all  of  the  turmoil   around  tech,  around  AI,  there's  going  to   be  more  and  more  cries  for  the   government  to  come  in  and  to  control   property,  control  markets,  and  to  have  a   full  visibility  into  the  way  that  you   have  your  own  personal  finances.  So,  I   think  crypto-based  privacy  will  become  a   genuine  useful  thing  for  the  world.  And   that  is  one  of  the  areas  that  crypto  can   do  in  a  way  no  other  software  can.  You   cannot  create  genuinely  private   transactions  in  the  legacy  system  in  the   legacy  system.  Still  a  little  bit  sick.   So  privacy  agentic  commerce  and  I  know   you  guys  are  going  to  skewer  me  alive   for  this  but  I  do  think  that  there  is   the  entertainment  side  of  this  right   where  we're  seeing  in  South  Korea  live   streamers  live  trading  crypto  live  per   trading  and  it's  being  treated  as  an   esport.  I  do  think  that  the  hyper   gamblization,  the  hyper  gambling  that   has  infected  the  entire  world,  not  just   in  crypto,  but  sports  gambling.  There's   a  whole  generation,  all  they  do  is   sports  gamble.  There's  a  whole   generation  that  gamble  in  Roblox.   Everything  has  become  gambling.  You  look   on  ESPN,  they're  showing  the  sports   game.  And  below  it,  it's  this  is  my  pick   six.  These  are  my  odds.  Every  single   thing  is  gambling.  You  can't  You  flip  on   the  UFC  and  they're  saying,  \"Oh,  you   could  make  a  million  dollars  if  you  bet   on  the  prediction  markets.\"  It  is   absolutely  ridiculous  the  way  gambling   is  being  shoved  down  your  throats  at   every  single  step  of  the  way  in  modern   culture.  And  I  think  that  it's  a  natural   extension  that  crypto  becomes  the   epicenter  of  where  risk  and  gambling  and   essentially  gaming  and  entertainment   meet.  And  so  I  do  think  that  that's  part   of  not  how  I  actually  anticipated  crypto   gaming  to  evolve,  but  I  do  think  gaming   and  gambling  and  crypto  will  kind  of   mishmash  together  into  becoming  the  a   future  form  of  entertainment.  So  those   are  the  the  areas  that  I  think  make   sense  in  the  future.  I'm  not  saying,   hey,  buy  this,  buy  that,  it's  going  to   go  up  for  sure,  but  I  still  think  that   there  are  some  really  compelling   narratives  that  you  can  only  do  in   crypto.  Of  course,  DeFi,  we  all  know   that  decentralized  finance.  Uh  that's   where  the  big  financial  institutions  are   coming  for  first.  But  those  are  the   really  interesting  things.  You  have   Bitcoin,  you  have  DeFi,  you  have  uh  sort   of  entertainment/gaming  and  gambling,   you  have  privacy,  and  you  have  agentic   commerce.  Those  are  really,  really   solid.  Uh,  and  I  think  that  those  will   stand  the  test  of  time,  not  just  today,   but  those  will  be  very  interesting   narratives  on  into  the  future,  knowing   everything  we  know  now  and  even   factoring  in  the  SAS  apocalypse,  the  AI   wiping  out  uh,  all  the  software.  I  think   that  those  narratives  are  still  very   interesting  in  that  world.  So,  I  think   that  it's  important  to  realize,  hey,   even  when  you  factor  everything  in,   there's  still  very  interesting  things   happening  in  the  world.  Um,  now  I  did   want  to  bring  this  up  here.  uh  Supernova   rewards  are  actually  going  live  for   super  stakers.  So  if  you're  a   superstaker  uh  some  of  the  ownership  of   supernova  is  being  uh  flown  through   flowed  through  to  super  stakers.  So  once   again  marrying  the  super  project  with   one  of  its  child  projects  supernova.  Um   again  we  know  the  market  has  been   extremely  rough.  I  know  that  it  has  been   extremely  rough  and  I  said  this  before   we  put  out  supernova.  We  were  expecting   for  the  market  to  be  very  flat.  Um,  but   the  point  here  is  the  project  is  up.   It's  live  and  the  team  can  now   continually  iterate  throughout  the  bare   market  now  that  the  thing  is  live  has   done  um  over  600  or  700  million  in   transactions  in  its  first  week.  And  so   this  is  now  a  way  for  that  value  to  flow   through  to  Superstakers.  Again,  check   this  out.  Really  cool  announcement  by   Superverse.  The  point  is  good  times,  bad   times,  you  keep  building,  keep   iterating,  and  you  keep  trying  to   deliver  stuff  to  the  audience.  Ain't  no   two  ways  about  it.  you  can't  change  the   weather,  but  you  can  keep  working  and   that's  what  we're  planning  to  do.  Um,  as   always,  you  know,  I  will  say  having  been   through  now  this  is  my  third  full  bare   market,  I  will  say  it  is  unfortunate,   right?  It's  unfortunate  where  we  are  as   an  industry  and  it  does  uh  it  does  get   very  difficult  at  times  to  continually   try  to  see  the  the  optimistic  side  of   things.  But  that's  how  markets  are.   Markets  do  beat  you  down  and  it's  the   people  who  act  counterintuitively  and   with  a  long-term  vision  that  eventually   succeed.  I'm  not  telling  you  to  run  out,   spend  a  bunch  bunch  of  money  on  crypto.   I've  been  net  bearish  structurally  since   we  reached  the  housekeeping  zone  or   really  since  we  broke  down  from  100K.   Um,  and  I  will  tell  you  as  soon  as  I   flip  bullish,  obviously  I've  been  uh   focused  more  on  shorting  right  now,  uh,   it's  not  really  content  that  I  think   makes  sense  for  the  channel  because  the   actual  way  that  trades  play  out  is  too   momentary.  I  can't  make  a  YouTube  video,   publish  it,  you  know,  edit  it,  publish   it,  and  have  it  be  about  some  short   entry  or  long  entry.  Um,  but  overall   pretty  simply,  uh,  once  we  do  flip   bullish,  I  believe  we'll  catch  it  very,   very  early  and  we  will  ride  the  next   bullish  wave.  Uh,  and  I'm  excited.  I'm   excited  for  the  future  because  most  of   the  time  what  happens  in  markets  like   this  is  you  wipe  the  tourists.  You  wipe   out  people  who  don't  have  a  long-term   vision,  who  don't  actually  have  the  guts   and  the  grit  to  stick  through  these   horrific  conditions  and  be  there  for  the   next  time.  Uh  we  did  that  through  the   last  bare  market  and  super  was  one  of   the  only  coins  that  actually  performed   from  the  lows  in  the  gaming  sector.  Uh   and  I'm  proud  of  that.  Even  though  the   gaming  sector  was  horrible,  I  still  feel   like  we  were  able  to  give  uh  some  life   back  to  the  project.  Um  so,  you  know,   that's  the  reality  is  that  you  just  keep   grinding  and  you  keep  your  head  down   knowing  that  at  some  point  things  do   shift  because  everything  is  a  cycle.  So,   uh,  try  not  to  get  too,  you  know,   wrapped  up  in  the  bare  euphoria,  but   also  don't  think  think  of  it  as  wrong  to   have  a  pragmatic  lens.  I  think  everyone   should  be  trying  to  be  as  pragmatic  as   they  can  right  now.  Um,  because  the  next   few  years  will  be  full  of  opportunities,   and  you  want  to  be  in  a  place  where  when   you  actually  see  that  opportunity,  you   have  a  chance  to  pounce,   upload  yourself  into  Ledger.  I  think   there's  something  um  to  be  said  about,   you  know,  staked  staked,  what's  it   called?  staked  content  where  you're   essentially  validating  that  the  content   is  yours.  You  have  some  kind  of   cryptographic  signature.  I  have  no  idea   how  to  um  invest  around  that  right  now,   but  it's  an  interesting  idea  that  you   have  um  you  have  some  kind  of  way  to   validate  content  knowing  that  hey,   anyone  can  make  a  video  of  my  face  with   my  voice  um  and  they  can  make  it  look   very  real  now.  So,  how  do  you  prove  that   I'm  me  and  how  do  you  prove  that  that's   not  me?  Well,  you  need  some  kind  of   unhackable,  unaccessible  signature.  So,   that's  that's  one  one  way  to  do  it.   We  can  tell  it's  your  third  bare  market,   L.  Your  forehead  is  growing  every  time.   How?  What  does  that  even  mean?  What  does   that  even  mean?  My  forehead's  growing.   How  does  my  forehead  grow?   How  does  a  forehead  grow  in  a  bare   market?  What  does  that  What  does  that   mean?   genuinely.   What's  up,  Elliot?  I've  been  watching   you  for  a  while.  Wondering  if  you  could   share  some  of  your  experience  starting  a   business.  What  was  the  biggest  uh  hurdle   for  you?  Uh  starting  a  business  is  very   difficult.  I  have  started  many.  I  have   failed  a  lot.  I  have  started  some  that   have  been  extremely  successful.  Um,  and   in  the  end,  the  business  will  always   rely  on  the  founder  to  work  extremely   hard  every  single  day.  And  there  will   often  times  be  no  rewards  for  your  work.   And  so,  starting  a  business,  the  hardest   thing  is  working  extremely  hard  when   there's  no  uh  reward  for  the  work  for   long  periods  of  time.  Eventually,  you   can  get  to  a  place  where  you  have   capital,  where  you  have  the  ability  to   fund  things  and  to  prepare  so  that  when   you  launch  things,  there's  more  of  an   effect.  Um,  but  for  example,  I  worked  on   Elio  Trades.  I  did  videos  on  this   channel  for  3  years  without  making  a   single  dollar.  So,  um  there  was  a  long   period  where  people  looked  at  me  as   absolutely  insane  for  filming  videos   about  cryptocurrency.  Like  absolutely   insane.  And  so  you  just  have  to  be   willing  to  endure  those  long  periods,   those  troughs  where  it's  only  you   congratulating  yourself  on  working  hard.   And  often  times  all  of  the  people  that   are  closest  to  you  will  look  at  you  with   doubt  because  secretly,  and  I  can  say   this  as  someone  who  has  made  it  by  other   people's  yard  sticks,  by  a  lot  of  other   people's  yard  sticks,  they  would  say,   \"Oh,  he's  made  it.\"  I  don't  consider   myself  having  made  it  because  there's  so   much  I  want  to  do  that  I  have  not  yet   accomplished.  But  a  lot  of  people  will   look  at  you  at  those  early  days.  And  the   truth  is  that  they  don't  want  you  to   make  it.  Because  when  you  make  it,  it   makes  them  feel  lesser  than.  And  as   someone  who  has  gotten  ahead  in  various   ways,  more  so  than  anyone  I  knew  growing   up,  um  it  doesn't  change.  Nobody  comes   around  and  goes,  \"Oh  my  god,  I'm  so  I'm   so  happy  for  you.\"  Like  some  people  do,   but  often  times  what  you  realize  is  that   uh  people  aren't  they're  not  focused  on   you  becoming  a  rockstar  success.  So  if   that's  what  your  goal  is  to  become  a   huge  success,  you  have  to  be  the  one,   you  know,  pushing  and  motivating   yourself  and  know  that  you  may  not  get   the  external  validation  ever.  So,  you   have  to  just  be  willing  to  grind  and  eat   glass  and  eat  [ __ ]  until  it  gets  until   the  stuff  gets  done.  Um,  but  that's  the   hardest  part  about  starting  a  business   is  just  being  the  only  one  who  believes   in  it  and  having  no  evidence,  no   external  evidence  that  things  will  work.   Uh,  and  never  getting  that  feedback  from   the  world.  Uh,  and  so,  and  that  can  go   on  for  long  long  periods  of  time.   Yo,  Tokyo  has  your  back.  I  appreciate   you  boys.  I  really  do.   Based  on  your  housing  idea,  won't  most   people  have  uh  won't  most  people  who   have  tremendous  wealth  in  their  houses   go  broke  due  to  equity  loss?  I  mean  uh   there  will  be  absolutely  equity  loss  but   a  lot  of  this  is  paper  wealth.  Now   people  who  have  uh  maybe  tremendous  so   the  other  part  about  this  is  interest   rates  will  probably  collapse  if  this   happens.  So  the  cost  of  borrowing  money   will  go  way  way way  way  way  down  um   because  inflation  will  also  collapse.   We'll  have  deflation.  So  the  difference   there  is  that  you  won't  have  people   owing  as  much  money  on  the  debt  and   there  will  be  able  to  be,  you  know,  ref.   There  will  also  be  a  wave  of  people  who   overlevered  and  they'll  be  forced  to   sell  and  that  will  be  further  pressure   downwards  on  housing  prices.  So  all  of   these  things  are  maybe  net  bad  for  the   super  rich  who  are  property  rich  who   rode  that  wave,  but  now  you  have   demographic  shifts.  There's  way  less   people  in  the  world.  There's  way  less  of   a  consumer  base  for  single  family   houses.  there's  way  less  people  having   children.  And  I  think  that  the  high  cost   of  living  has  everything  to  do  with   that.  So  yes,  we  can  bust  out  our   violins  and  say,  \"Oh  yeah,  we're  sad   that  the  boomers  and  their  property   valuations  have  been  gap  got  getting   absolutely  frame  mogged.\"  But  the   reality  is  that  that's  good  for  the   world.  I  don't  think  having  the  boomers   sitting  on  five  houses  and  generational   wealth  because  they  bought  a  few  houses   in  the  80s,  how  is  that  helping  society?   I  don't  think  it  helps  society   personally.  I  think  that's  just   gatekeeping.  So,  um,  obviously  in  the   process,  if  there's  a  bunch  of  loans   that  go  bad  that  the  banks  can't  get   paid  back  on,  then  banks  go  under,   people  lose  their  life  savings,  that's   the  cycle  that  leads  to  the  government   printing  money.  And  once  that  stuff   happens,  then  you  get  the  printer  fired   back  up,  and  then  you  get  things  like   Bitcoin  start  to  gap  up,  right?  You  get   things  like  gold  start  to  gap  up,  right?   So,  that's  where  you  start  to  see  the   debasement  trade  come  back.  Um,  and  I   think  that  you  understand  that  the   displacement  of  knowledge  workers  is  the   same  thing.  The  thing  that  we  were  just   talking  about  earlier  in  this  episode,   the  Catrini  article,  the  displacement  of   those  knowledge  workers,  that  leads  to   more  loans  going  bad.  That  leads  to  good   quality  loans  not  getting  paid  back,   right?  Which  is  a  whole  different  uh   sector  of  the  economy  that  is  normally   not  under  risk.  You  have  all  of  the   high-quality  borrowers,  the  executives   at  tech  companies,  all  of  a  sudden   they're  laid  off  and  they're  no  longer   going  to  pay  back  their  mortgage,  no   longer  going  to  pay  back  their  car   loans.  Those  types  of  things  have   massive  knock  on  knock-on  effects  for   the  economy.  So  am  I  saying  like  this  is   a  good  thing?  No.  I'm  saying  that  there   will  be  some  violence.  There  will  be   some  brutal  violence  here.  But  on  the   other  side,  maybe  there  is  something   much  closer  to  a  world  in  which  you  can   just  have  a  life.  You  know,  you  don't   need  to  be  the  number  one  uh  you  know,   kid  genius  to  break  free  of  the  social   situation  you've  been  placed  in.  I  saw  a   great  article  by  my  buddy  Will  Clemente   here.  Uh  he  had  article  here  saying   climbing  a  broken  ladder  a  message  to  my   fellow  zoomers.  I  think  Will  he  says   he's  23.  Uh  essentially  this  is  an   amazing  article  but  it's  it's   highlighting  all  of  the  things  we  know   to  be  true  here  which  is  that  you  cannot   get  ahead  from  college  right  you  can't   get  ahead  with  a  degree  that  costs  more   than  it  pays.  Uh  you  have  the  government   backing  of  student  loans.  He  argues  this   created  wave  and  overinflation  of   college  degrees.  Um  he  also  talks  about   the  rise  of  AI  and  robotics.  We  know   this.  You  can't  get  entry-  level  work   anymore.  Um  and  more  importantly  he   shows  this  graph  which  has  um  where  was   it?  It  was  America  and  its  social   mobility.  Uh  effectively  showing  where   was  it?  Is  it  up  here  at  the  top?  Maybe   that  was  a  different  article.  But   effectively  this  article  is  showing  how   we  no  longer  have  the  same  social   contract.  We  don't  have  the  same  ability   for  Americans  to  pull  themselves  up  by   their  bootstraps  to  get  ahead  to  go  get   a  degree  to  go  invest  in  themselves.  uh   and  it  has  everything  to  do  with  the   amount  of  wealth  being  hoarded  at  the   top  of  the  generations  and  in  in  assets   and  the  wealth  distribution.  So  uh  it's   going  to  be  an  interesting  time  like  I   said  uh  but  I  do  think  that  I  feel  for   even  the  the  younger  generations  alpha   and  zoomers  because  it  was  hard  on   millennials  too.  I  was  very  lucky.  I  was   very  fortunate  to  take  huge  risks   getting  into  things  like  content   creation  and  crypto.  Most  of  the  people   who  I  grew  up  with  thought  I  was  crazy   for  not  going  to  get  a  business  degree,   a  law  degree.  when  I  had  those   opportunities  and  now  I  look  back  and  I   am  so  thankful  I  listened  to  that  voice   inside  and  took  the  risk  but  it   shouldn't  be  the  case  that  you  have  to   take  extreme  risk  and  be  a  one  of  you   know  thousands  or  millions  to  be  able  to   get  to  a  place  where  you  are  uh   sufficient  and  having  a  good  quality   life.  Even  for  me  the  housing  in  tier   one  cities  in  America  is  insane.  It's   insane.  It's  I  don't  owning  I  don't  own   a  home  yet.  I  I  haven't  invested  in  real   estate  yet.  I  think  it's  an  absolute   scam.  I  just  think  it's  a  dumb  thing  to   do  with  your  money.  Personally,  I  don't   like  buying  the  top  on  things.  Um,  would   I  love  a  place  for  my  little  kiddos  to   run  around  in?  Yeah.  Yeah,  we'll  figure   that  out.  But  for  right  now,  I  think   that  uh  the  housing  market  has  detached   from  reality  as  far  as  the  value  it   provides  and  what  it  costs.  And  I  think   that  if  that  corrects,  it'd  be  good.   All  right,  guys.  I  gotta  wrap  because  I   got  to  get  to  something  else  right  now.   Yeah,  look,  we  we  have  become  macro   investors  on  this  channel.  We  have   become  all  kinds  of  people  of  the  world.   And  it's  important  that  we  become   heavily  understanding  and  heavily   anticipatory  of  the  changes  from  AI,   from  robotics,  specifically  AI  right   now.  But  in  my  opinion,  the  thing  after   the  thing  is  robots,  right?  The  embodied   AI,  the  shape  rotators.  what  are  the   physical  things  that  are  actually  going   to  benefit  from  AI  because  I  think  the   digital  things  are  mostly  going  to   suffer  for  a  bit.  Um  so  understanding   bits  to  atoms  the  physical  things  are   going  to  benefit  more  than  the  software.   Let's  get  ahead  of  these  trends.  And  I   believe  that  like  staying  in  the  arena   and  staying  locked  in  in  in  the  pain   cave  over  the  next  few  months  as  much  as   it's  like  oh  my  god  people  are  going  to   lose  their  minds  because  the  markets   have  are  going  to  be  so  difficult.  We're   going  to  look  back  at  2026.  We're  going   to  look  back  at  2027  and  say  those  were   the  times  to  be  making  moves  based  on   what's  happening  in  the  2030s  and  the   late  2020s.  These  are  the  times  to  to   keep  your  head  on  a  swivel  and   understand  that  crisis  breeds   opportunity  and  we  are  in  the  midst  of   AI  reaching  a  bare  euphoria  crisis  and   it's  affecting  everything.  So,  I  believe   Bitcoin  has  been  taken  down  largely  by   not  only  the  marginal  desire  for  uh  AI   investments,  for  people's  risk  dollars,   but  also  the  world  risking  off  from   software  in  general  and  Bitcoin  trades   with  software.  So,  these  are  important   trends.  I  think  we  should  all  be   tracking  them  together.  I  hope  you  guys   enjoyed  this  episode.

Az AI nemcsak a munkahelyek elvesztése miatti félelem, hanem a tényleges munkahelyek automatizálása miatt is aggasztó. A Bitcoin és a szoftverek közötti szoros korrelációt emeli ki, ami megnehezíti a Bitcoin továbbfejlődését egy olyan piacon, ahol az AI dominál.

Az AI fejlődése azonban nem csupán gazdasági kihívásokat, hanem lehetőségeket is teremt, ha a társadalmi struktúrákat képesek lesznek alkalmazkodni. Az elmondottak szerint a jövőbeli piaci reakciók és a gazdasági struktúrák mennyire alkalmazkodnak az új technológiákhoz, kulcsfontosságú kérdések lesznek.",

The fear surrounding AI is causing substantial losses in the stock market, amounting to hundreds of billions of dollars. This anxiety is driven not only by actual job losses due to automation but also by the fear of future losses. Bitcoin's strong correlation with software markets makes its growth challenging in a climate dominated by AI. Retail investors have poured record amounts into markets, while larger institutions express concerns about the effects of AI. However, the evolution of AI presents not only economic challenges but also potential opportunities if societal structures can adapt. The future market reactions and how economic systems adjust to new technologies will be pivotal questions.",
