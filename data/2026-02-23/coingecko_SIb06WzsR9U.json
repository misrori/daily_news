    "transcript": "If  you're  serious  about  holding  your  own   Bitcoin,  Electrum  is  a  wallet  worth   paying  attention  to.  Now,  it's  been   around  since  2011.  It's  open-  source,   Bitcoin  only,  and  trusted  by  many  power   users.  Unlike  beginner  wallets  that   abstract  away  the  details,  Electrum   shows  you  exactly  what's  happening  and   lets  you  control  it  directly.  Now,  it   has  a  mobile  version,  but  we'll  be   focusing  on  the  desktop  [music]  wallet   in  this  video.   Let's  start  by  downloading  Electrum  from   the  official  site,  electrum.org.  Now   guys,  always  double  check  that  you're  on   the  real  site.  We  don't  want  to  download   malware  from  fishing  clones.  Okay,  once   installed,  launch  Electrum  and  you'll   land  in  the  wallet  creation  wizard.  Name   your  wallet,  hit  next,  and  choose  what   kind  you  want.  For  most  people,  standard   wallet  is  the  way  to  go.  You  get  a   12word  recovery  phrase  and  full  control.   If  you  want  extra  protection,  Electrum   also  supports  two  factor  authentication.   It  works  by  requiring  a  timebased  code   from  Google  Authenticator  before  any   transaction  can  be  sent.  So  even  if   someone  does  get  your  wallet  file,  they   still  can't  spend  your  Bitcoin  without   that  code.  The  multi-IG  option  lets  you   go  fully  custom.  Set  up  wallets  that   require  multiple  signatures  like  two  of   three  or  three  of  five.  This  is  great   for  shared  custody  or  spreading  risk   across  devices.  Lastly,  you  can  import   private  keys  or  addresses  and  that's   useful  for  restoring  older  wallets  using   private  keys  or  creating  a  watchonly   wallet  using  Bitcoin  addresses  which   means  you  simply  monitor  wallet  activity   without  putting  your  private  keys   [music]  on  that  device.  So,  we'll  go   with  standard.  So,  choose  create  new   seed.  Back  up  those  12  words.  Confirm.   Set  a  password.  And  Electrum  boots  up   your  new  wallet.  Once  it  opens,  you'll   see  Electum's  main  interface,  a  menu  bar   up  top,  tabs  like  history,  send,  and   receive  in  the  middle,  and  a  status  bar   at  the  bottom.  We'll  be  coming  back  to   many  of  these  as  we  dig  into  Electrum's   more  advanced  features,  but  let's  start   with  one  that  you'll  probably  use  a  lot.   Fee  control.  Most  wallets  handle  fees  in   the  background,  but  Electrum  lets  you   have  full  control,  so  you  can  decide  how   fast  you  want  your  transactions   confirmed.  To  test  this  out,  head  to  the   send  tab,  fill  in  a  recipient  address   and  amount.  If  you  also  want  to  see  the   fiat  value,  go  to  tools,  then  click  on   preferences  from  the  drop-down,  navigate   to  the  fiat  tab,  and  choose  your  local   currency.  And  you  can  also  change   Bitcoin  units  here.  So,  back  in  the  send   tab,  click  pay  and  you'll  get  the  fee   slider.  From  the  fee  policy  dropdown,   Electrum  gives  you  three  estimation   modes  that  you  can  pick  between.  The   first  one,  ETA  mode,  targets   confirmation  within  a  specific  number  of   blocks.  Menool  mode,  bases  the  fee  on   how  many  transactions  are  waiting,   placing  yours  at  a  certain  depth  in  the   [music]  queue.  Fee  rate  mode  is  fully   manual.  You  pick  the  exact  stats  per   bite,  but  set  it  to  low  and  it  might   never  confirm.  Now,  these  modes  exist  to   help  you  interpret  the  fee  market  better   and  pick  the  tradeoff  between  speed   versus  cost  that  fits  what  you're  trying   to  do  rather  than  hoping  that  the  wallet   picks  something  reasonable.  Another  one   of  Electrum's  most  powerful  features  is   manual  coin  control,  especially  if  you   care  about  privacy.  When  you  receive   Bitcoin,  each  payment  becomes  a  separate   spendable  chunk  called  a  UTXO.   Most  wallets  just  auto  select  some   combination  of  these  to  cover  your  next   transaction,  but  this  might  accidentally   link  parts  of  your  financial  activity   [music]  that  should  stay  separate,  like   your  business  and  personal  wallets.  So,   Electrum  lets  you  override  all  of  that   by  giving  you  complete  control  over   which  coins  get  spent.  So  to  access   this,  go  to  the  top  menu,  click  view,   then  select  show  [music]  coins,  and   you'll  now  see  a  new  coins  tab  appear   next  to  your  usual  ones  like  history  and   addresses.  Inside  the  coins  tab,  you'll   see  a  detailed  list  of  all  your  UTXOs.   [music]  So  each  line  shows  the  amount,   the  source  transaction,  and  the  address   [music]  that  it  belongs  to.  So  from   here,  you  can  manually  select  exactly   which  coins  that  you  want  to  spend.  Once   you  select  it,  rightclick  it  and  choose   add  to  coin  control.  Then  you'll  see  a   message  at  the  bottom  of  Electrum's   window  and  it  says  coin  control  active.   So  this  means  that  your  next  transaction   will  use  only  the  UTXOs  that  [music]  you   just  selected.  Everything  else  will  be   ignored  temporarily.  Another  tool  in   your  coin  control  arsenal  is  freezing.   In  either  the  coins  or  addresses  tab,   you  can  rightclick  [music]   on  any  entry,  whether  it's  an  individual   coin  or  an  entire  address,  and  choose   freeze.  [music]   So,  this  tells  Electrum  to  not  touch   these  funds  no  matter  what.  And  this  is   useful  for  cold  funds  that  you  don't   want  to  accidentally  spend  or  for  UTXOs   tied  to  activity  that  you'd  rather  not   mingle  with  other  transactions.  Electum   also  gives  you  full  control  over  the   servers  that  it  connects  to,  something   that  most  wallets  handle  silently  in  the   background.  By  default,  Electrum   connects  to  public  servers  to  fetch  your   transaction  history,  balance,  and  to   broadcast  transactions.  And  these   servers  don't  have  access  to  your   private  keys.  So,  they  can't  steal  your   coins,  but  they  can  still  log  your  data   and  build  a  profile  of  your  activity.  So   to  avoid  this,  Electrum  lets  you   manually  select  which  server  to  connect   to  or  even  better  run  your  own  Electrum   server  for  maximum  trust  and  [music]   privacy.  If  you're  not  running  your  own,   you  can  still  protect  your  privacy  by   using  [music]  Tour.  So  Tour  hides  your   IP  address  by  routing  your  traffic   through  a  global  network  of  servers.  And   this  makes  it  much  harder  for  Electrum   servers  to  link  [music]  your  activity  to   your  identity.  To  set  this  up,  first   download  the  tour  browser  from   tourro.org.   Connect  to  the  tour  network.  Once  tour   browser  is  up  and  connected,  head  into   Electrum.  Then  click  on  the  network  icon   in  the  bottom  right  corner  or  go  to   tools  and  then  network.  [music]  In  the   window  that  opens,  select  the  proxy  tab.   Now  check  the  use  proxy  box.  In  the   dropown,  select  SOCK  5-our  and  in  the   host  field,  type  127.0.0.1.   Then  set  the  port  to  9050.   [music]  This  tells  Electrum  to  send  all   its  traffic  through  the  tour  network   that's  already  running  on  your  machine.   Basically,  it  hides  your  connection  so   the  servers  that  you  talk  to  don't  see   your  real  IP  address.  Once  this  is  done,   close  the  network  window  and  you'll  know   that  it's  working  when  Electum's   circular  icon  in  the  bottom  right  turns   blue  and  that  means  that  it  successfully   connected  through  tour.  Electrum  also   supports  the  lightning  network,  which  is   Bitcoin's  second  layer  for  fast  and   cheap  payments.  And  it  works  by  letting   you  open  a  payment  channel  with  another   user,  send  Bitcoin  instantly  with  very   low  fees,  and  only  settle  the  final   result  on  chain  when  the  channel  closes.   So,  you  can  open  channels  using  the   channels  tab.  If  it's  not  visible,   enable  it  via  the  view  menu.  Then,  pick   a  node  to  connect  to.  Decide  how  much  to   commit  from  your  onchain  wallet  and   Electrum  will  handle  the  setup.  Once  a   channel  is  open,  sending  a  Lightning   payment  is  easy.  Just  paste  a  Lightning   invoice  into  the  send  tab.  Electrum   recognizes  it  automatically  and  switches   into  Lightning  mode.  To  receive,  go  to   the  receive  tab,  switch  to  Lightning,   and  generate  an  invoice  like  you  would   for  an  onchain  request.  Channel   management  happens  in  the  channels  tab.   You  can  view  your  balances  status  and   close  them  when  needed.  And  with  that,   you're  ready  to  start  using  some  of   Electrum's  most  powerful  features.  Now,   yes,  it  asks  a  bit  more  of  you  than  your   average  wallet,  but  in  return,  you  get   control  and  transparency,  and  that  is   hard  to  [music]  beat.  As  with  all  things   Bitcoin,  take  your  time,  start  small,   try  a  test  transaction  or  two,  and  build   [music]  confidence  as  you  go.  And  also,   let  us  know  how  your  Electrum  journey   goes  in  the  comments  below.  Bye.   >> [music]",
