    "transcript": "All  pain,  no  gain.  As  geopolitical   uncertainty  continues  to  build,  crypto   and  other  markets  continue  to  suffer.   Trump  defied.  The  US  Supreme  Court  has   enraged  the  president  by  ruling  his   tariffs  to  be  illegal.  What  happens   next?  And  what  does  this  all  mean  for   crypto?  Agentic  Finance  X42  is  one  of   the  few  bright  spots  in  crypto  right   now.  We  bring  you  up  to  speed  with  the   latest  developments  and  explain  why  this   is  such  a  big  deal.  And  we'll  have  some   top  tier  TA  tweets  of  the  week,  dates   for  your  diary,  and  much  more.  Besides,   this  is  the  Coin  Bureau  News  Live.   GM,  happy  Monday,  and  welcome  back  to   the  most  important  show  of  the  week.   This  is  of  course  the  Coin  Bureau  weekly   news  live  stream.  My  name  is  Nick.  Guy,   how  are  you  feeling?   >> I   >> on  a  scale  of  1  to  10.   >> What?  One  being  one  being  we're  so  over,   10  being  we're  so  bad.   >> Yeah,  exactly  in  that  in  that  range.  I   >> I'm  just  going  to  say  we're  to  we're   towards  the  lower  end  of  that  range.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  Because  we  broke  through  65K   overnight  again  on  the  on  account  of   Trump  tweeting  which  we'll  be  getting   to.   >> I  will  be  honest  with  you,  I'm  kind  of   surprised  we're  still  this  high.   >> Yeah.  I  mean,  given  how  far  everyone's   been  calling  for  that  200  week  moving   average  below  60K,   >> I  mean,  it  just  seems  to  be  dragging  us   down  there,  but  slowly,  you  know,  slowly   ending  our  hope,  you  know,  not  all  at   once,  but  basically  dragging  us  along.   So,   >> yeah,  but  we'll  be  looking  at  that,   guys.  Of  course,  we'll  be  looking  at  um   what's  been  happening  with  the  price   over  the  past  week.  It  was  a  very  busy   week  indeed  last  week.  We'll  also  be   taking  a  look  at  um  if  you  guys  thought   that  the  tariff  kurfuffle  was  over  last   year  with  all  those  trade  trade  deals   being  signed.  There's  a  bit  of  a   surprise  that  the  Supreme  Court  had  for   us  last  week   >> just  a  little.  Yeah.   >> Kind  of  threw  a  bit  of  a  spanner  in  the   works,  shall  we  say.  Uh  so  we'll  be   looking  at  that  and  the  impact  on  the   markets.  And  then  of  course  we'll  be   looking  at  one  of  the  final  remaining   bullish  crypto  narratives  that  uh   everyone  seems  to  have  uh  latched  on  to   on  crypto  Twitter  and  that  is  Agentic   Finance.  So  it's  an  exciting  uh   narrative  we're  looking  at.  But  of   course  guys,  please  fire  up  those  likes.   We  know  it's  ambitious  but  we're  going   to  shoot  for  the  stars  because  then  at   least  you'll  touch  the  ceiling.   We'll  get  100  likes.  Maybe  1,000  likes.   Let's  go  for  it.  If  we  get  to  1,000   likes,  get  I  think  we  should  get  Guy  to   do  the  TA  section  next  week.  How  about   that?   >> Okay.   >> Guy's  got  some  great   >> I'm  so  confident  we're  not  going  to  get   to  a,000  likes.  I  will  I  Yeah,  sure.   Okay.  Get  to  1,000  likes.  If  that  status   bar  underneath  Nick  gets  to  100%,  then  I   will  do  the  TA  next  week.  And  you  know,   who  knows  that  could  signal  the  start  of   the  next  bull  market.   >> There  we  go.  And  don't  forget  to   subscribe  and  hit  the  bell  as  well,   guys.  Uh  and  yeah,  so  let's  kick  off   with  the  week  in  Bitcoin.  Uh  now,  if  you   guys  will  recall,  last  week,  Monday  was   the  one  of  the  most  important  days  of   the  year.  It  was  President's  Day  where   we  salute  the  leader,  the  chief,  you   know,  his  excellency,  Mr.  Trump.   >> I  like  that  photo.  What  is  anything   happening?   >> Yeah,  WTF.  You  know  what's  going  with  my   what's  going  on  with  my  portfolio?   >> Is  this  on?  What's  going  on?   >> So,  yes.  So  this  was  uh  so  this  was   President's  Day  last  month.  President's   Day  exactly.  So  the  markets  were  closed.   >> They  were  closed.  US  markets  were   closed.   >> Yeah.   >> But  it  was  a  very  bullish  day.  Well,   actually  not  bullish.  It  was  the  start   of  the  new  Chinese  New  Year.  This  is  the   year  of  the  fire,  right?   >> Although  um  unfortunately  historically   the  years  of  the  horses  hasn't  been  that   bullish,  right?  It  hasn't  been  bullish   in  the  market.   >> Yes.  Historically  uh  horse  years  are  are   not  great.  I  mean,  you  know,  it's  there   have  be  I  I  think  the  average  works  out   to  a  fairly  small  um  decline  in,  you   know,  in  in  overall  sort  of  markets,  but   nothing  catastrophic,  but  there  are  a   few  sort  of  outlier  years.  I  think  1929   was  a  horse  year,  for  instance.  And  as   as  students  of  history  will  know,  that   that  wasn't  that  wasn't  a  vintage.   >> Well,  fire  a  horse  on  fire.  I  don't  know   what  that's  supposed  to  signify,  but   let's  see.  Uh   >> probably  probably  fine  probably  fine.   >> Uh  Tuesday  um  well  there  was  this  news   that  Wall  Street  was  or  indeed  the   entire  financial  lots  of  lots  of   financial  institutions  were  shorting  the   dollar  at  record  levels   >> and  indeed  the  dollar  had  broken  through   a  long  long-term  trend  line  from  a  few   years  ago.  So  the  dollar  is  falling.   >> Okay.   >> And  that  should  traditionally  be  good   for  risk  assets  but  uh  not  so  much.  We   seem  to  be  in  a  different  paradigm  right   now.  Um,  now  Wednesday,  we  saw  an   indicator  which  I  must  say  I'd  either   never  heard  of  or  forgotten  about,  but   this  is  the  World  Uncertainty  Index.   >> I  mean,  at  least  something's  at  least   something's  going  up.  Yes,  this  is  uh,   as  you  could  as  you  could  no  doubt  tell   from  this  uh  from  this  graph,  the  world   uncertainty  index  just  went  absolutely   ballistic.   >> I'm  completely  uncertain  of  what  to  do   with  this.   although  it  does  see  I'm  a  little   confused  about  this  because  it  does  seem   to  think  that  COVID  19  happened  in  sort   of  2014.   >> Um   >> but  uh  nevertheless  I  think  um  I  have   heard  talk  about  sort  of  general   uncertainty  uh  climbing  um  from  this.  So   uh  yeah.   >> Wow.  Okay.  And  um  it's  for  good  reason   of  course  because  we  got  news  last  week   indeed  throughout  the  whole  of  the  week   that  a a  strike  on  Iran  was  imminent.   >> War  in  the  Middle  East.  I'm  sure  this  is   going  to  go  swimmingly.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  This  was  talked  about  a  lot.   We  did  we  did  kind  of  wonder  whether  we   might  see  something  like  that  happen   over  the  weekend.  Um  because  as  you  said   on  Twitter,  Nick,  these  things  generally   tend  to  happen  over  the  weekend  so  that   people  are  able  to  sell  off  their   crypto.   >> Only  crypto.  Exactly.   >> That's  the  only  market  that's  actually   trading  at   >> Trump  actually  times  it  such  that  it's   just  on  the  Friday  evening  so  he  can   make  his  pro  crypto  credentials  known  by   tanking  the  markets.   >> Tired  of  winning.  Tired.  So  So  tired  of   winning.  So,  so  tired.  Um,  we  also  had   the  FOMC  minutes  on  Wednesday  as  well.   Uh,  they  were  actually  on  the  hawkish   side.   >> Yes,  slightly  hawkish  to  the  extent  that   several  of  the  um  Fed  governors  favored   quote  twosided  guidance  at  which  the   bank  might  opt  to  hike  rates  if   inflation  continues  to  remain  risky.  So,   they  basically  said,  we're  not  looking   to  hike  rates,  but  we  need  to  keep  our   wording  slightly  more  ambiguous  such   that  there's  the  possibility  of  rate   hikes.  all  the  Fed  speak.  You  know,   >> I  I  was  going  to  say  a  masterclass  in   Fed  Speak.  It's  like  we  might  do  this,   but  we  might  also  do  that.   >> Just  keep  it  in  time.  Yeah.   >> Um  meanwhile,  uh  Thursday  brought  us   some  movement  on  the  Clarity  Act.  Um  the   uh  there  was  another  meeting  at  the   White  House.  The  White  House  is  actually   quite  keen  to  get  this  through.  Um  there   was  some  progress  according  to  CoinDesk,   but  no  breakthrough  yet.   >> Yeah,  nothing  yet.  Uh  and  um  the  White   House  has  urged  bankers  to  allow  for   limited  stable  coin  rewards  that  won't   threaten  their  deposit  business   according  to  sources  familiar  with   talks.  Um  and  Kelards  are  actually   picking  up  on  this.  I  think  they're  at   about  uh  68%  before  2027.  So  slightly  on   the  bullish  side.   >> I  mean  I  imagine  the  bank's  idea  of  sort   of  limited  rewards  on  stable  coins  would   be  about  0.03%   which  is  roughly  what  they  pay  on  on   dollars.   >> Bit  ambitious  0.0  01%  I  think  is   probably  yeah  they  don't  they  don't  want   to  be  they  don't  want  to  give  money  away   you'll  get  something  guys   >> um  uh  there  was  some  good  news  uh  the   jobless  claims  came  in  slightly  lower   than  expected  um  however  it  has  to  be   said  Nick  that  you  made  a  video  this   morning  which  will  be  coming  out  soon   about  how  all  these  jobs  numbers  are   total   >> total  BS  exactly  a  mirage   >> BS  from  the  BLS   >> they  don't   >> um  so  keep  a  look  out  for  that  because   it  is  very  interesting  and  it  says  uh  it   says  a  Well,  it  completely  reframes  the   whole  debate  around  interest  rates,   inflation,  jobless  numbers,  etc.  So,   keep  a  keep  a  look  out  for  for  Nick  and   his  dulit  tones  on  that  one.   >> Speaking  about  Nick  and  his  doulit   tones,  unfortunately,  guys,  uh  we've  got   some  bad  news  for  you  that  uh  the  CME   will  be  introducing  24/7  trading  of   futures,  Bitcoin  futures  instruments   coming  in  the  next  few  months,   >> which  means  that  unfortunately  we're   going  to  have  to  retire  the  concept  of   the  CME  gap.  Um,  so  I'm  I'm  trying  to   come  to  terms  with  this  cuz  what  else   are  we  going  to  talk  about  on  these   streams  to  be  honest  because  I  yearn  for   the  more  Monday  mornings  when  I  could   talk  about  the  gaps.   >> It's  so  over.  It's  so  over.   >> Yes,  that  is  coming.   >> What  are  we  going  to  talk  about  without   CM?   >> I  don't  know,  bro.  I  like  what  else,   man?  We're  just  going  to  have  to  turn   into  a  comedy  show.   >> This  bare  market  just  gets  worse  and   worse.  Okay,  so  24  247  CME  trading  for   Bitcoin  uh  options.  uh  you  can  look   forward  to  there.   >> Yeah.   >> Um  so  Friday  presumably  the  week  was   winding  down  getting  ready  for  the   weekend.  Everything  was  nice  and  chill.   >> Chill.  Looking  forward  to  some  good   economic  numbers  and  we  didn't  get  that   unfortunately.  And  this  is  bad  on  two   accounts  actually.  Worst  of  both  worlds.   Not  only  did  you  have  a  slowing  economy   well  not  slowing  but  like  GDP  growth   itself  was  for  for  the  fourth  quarter   was  1.4%  which  is  far  below  expectations   on  account  of  the  government  shutdown   last  year.  But  also  we  had  a  surprising   spike  in  the  PCE  inflation  numbers.  So   this  is  the  Fed's  preferred  inflation   measure,  the  personal  consumption   expenditures  index  and  it  was  higher   than  expected.  Um  so  yeah,  it's  not   looking  good  there.   >> Okay.  Okay.  Um  so  uh  then  came  the  big   news  which  we  are  going  to  talk  about  in   a  little  more  detail  later  on,  but  this   was  Friday.  uh  the  Trump  tariffs  were   struck  down  by  the  Supreme  Court  or  I   suppose  more  accurately  they  were  ruled   by  uh  by  a  six-3  majority  um  to  be   illegal.   >> Yeah,  illegal.  There  we  go.  I  wonder  if   Trump  has  framed  that  tariff  scorecard   on  his  uh  in  the  White  House.   >> I  would  imagine  you  can  probably  buy   that  as  as  sort  of  MAGA  Trump  merch,   can't  you?   >> I'm  surprised  he  hasn't  started  that   yet.  Yeah,  because  knowing  Trump,   >> I  mean,  seeing  as,  you  know,  seeing  as   us  crypto  bros  are  all  going to  be  out   of  a  job  soon.  Um,  would  the  White  House   like  a  merch  consultant?  You  know,  I   could   maybe  start  pitching  for  a  new  job.  Um,   but  we're  going  to  talk  about  the   tariffs  in  a  bit  more  detail  later.  So,   just  just  hold  that  thought  there  and  we   will  talk  about  what  happened  in  crypto   over  the  weekend  and  into  Monday.   >> Yeah.  So,  uh,  not  looking  good  on  the   ETF  in  unfortunately.  I  mean,  what  else   I'm  going  to  say,  bro?  Uh,  fifth   straight  week  of  outflows  on  the  ETF   side.  Bitcoin  ETFs.  So,  it  wasn't   looking  good  there.  And  um  there  was   some  just  super  sideways  action  for   Bitcoin  over  the  weekend.   >> Oh,  look  at  classic  crab   >> crabing  along.   >> Yeah.   >> But  then  came  Monday  morning  and  Trump   put  out  a  post  on  Truth  Social  saying,   \"We're  winning  too  much.  It's  just  not   fair.\"   >> Okay.  Yeah.   >> Okay.  Surely  surely  this  must  correspond   to  uh  to  a  massive  great  pump  in  the   market,  right?  Sure.  Right.  Oh.   >> Oh.  And  this  is  not  a  joke,  guys.  That   is  literally  the  exact  timestamp.  He   comes  out,  he  makes  that  post  and   Bitcoin  just  decides  to  go  actually,   >> you  know,  here  we  go  again.  What  is  it?   >> Bit  Bitcoin  actually  sort  of  trolling   Trump  there.   >> I  mean,  whoever's  market  sold  it  on  that   moment.  I  was  basically  just  waited  for   that  tweet.  I  mean,  I'm  curious  to  see   what  happens  if  he  actually  changed  the   changed  the  word  into  we're  losing  too   much.  Would  that  have  actually  been  a   pump?  I  mean,  the  inverse.   >> You  got  to  think  this.  You  got  to  think   this  like  Yeah.  is  literally  the  time   stamp.   >> Do  you  think  that's  Michael  Sailor  just   seeing  that  and  going,  \"Oh,  for  goodness   sake,  sell,  sell,  sell,  sell.\"  Um,  okay.   And,  uh,  well,  it's  worth  pointing  out   at  this  stage  now  as  we're  talking  about   Bitcoin  and  Trump.  Um  the  uh  the  crypto   market  has  now  drum  roll  please   completely  erased  its  all  seen  since   Donald  Trump  was  I  I  think  is  this  since   Donald  Trump  was  elected  since  his   election  victory.   >> The  election  victory  not  even  just  the   inauguration  the  election  victory.  So   literally  the  a  generational  round  trip   for  everyone  involved.   >> Yeah.  Um,  and  it's  also  a  Satoshi  era   whale  just  to,  you  know,  just  to  add   some  the  cherry  on  the  top.  A  Satoshi   whale  woke  up  this  morning  and  decided   when  he  saw  that  Trump  post,  \"Oh   I'm  dumping.\"  And  they  dumped  7250   million  of  Bitcoin.   >> Wow.   >> So,  anyways,  with  that  positive  news  out   of  the  way,  what  is  to  come?  Uh  so  uh   we've  got  Iran  war  escalation,  Mex   Mexico  war  escalation,  earnings,   tariffs,  and  macro  releases  all  coming  a   bit  later  in  the  stream.  So  keep  an  eye   on  that.  We  also  have  the  US  opening  and   it  should  open  in  about  now  18  minutes   time.  Uh  currently  futures  futures  are   slightly  down.   >> Okay.   >> Um  quickly  looking  at  some  charts.   Unfortunately  guys,  I  got  some   unfortunately  well  I  I  can't  say  I  got   good  news.  I  don't  right.  But  we   Bitcoin's  we  chart  on  the  weekly  is   looking  deathly  and  that's  because  it's   actually  the  first  time  in  history  this   has  ever  happened.  One  is  we've  had  the   sixth  negative  weekly  close  in  a  red  red   in  a  row.  We've  also  and  that's  also   been  the  sixth  consecutive  close  below   the  100  weekly  moving  average  and  it's   the  third  consecutive  close  below  the   2021  cycle  high.  M   >> so  it  seems  as  if  that  200  week  as  we   mention  mentioned  at  the  top  of  the   stream  that  200E  moving  average  is   acting  like  a  bit  of  a  magnet  right  now.   >> Okay.  Okay.  So  uh  yeah  generally  um  I   mean  the  bot  one  one  more  point  sorry   there's  to  put  out  there  is  we  do   potentially  look  like  we're  at  a  bottom   if  you  were  to  read  this  RSI  the  weekly   RSI  is  at  levels  not  seen  since  FTX  and   Luna.  So  that  if  the  RSI  is  oversold   that  generally  seems  tends  to  be  seen  as   a  a  sign  of  a  bottoming.  However,  I  will   note  that  we  do  know  what  happened  to   Bitcoin  subsequent  to  FTX  and  Luna.  I   mean  to  Luna  and  3AC,  we  had  the  FTX   debacle.  So   >> yeah.  So  if  if  history  is  set  to  repeat,   there's  there's  one  more  there's  one   more  drop  down,  one  more   >> waiting  in  the  water  to  take  us  take  us   lower  and  that  will  be  the  bottom.   >> But  we  close.   >> We're  close.  We're  close.  It  feels  like   feels  like  we're  close  and  that  surely   is  something  to  celebrate.  Now,  if  you   are  if  you  by  some  by  some  chance  are   looking  for  a  top  tier  exchange  to  trade   uh  to  trade  this  market  on,  then  uh   there  is  no  better  option  than  Tubbit,   right  Nick?   >> Yeah,  exactly.

Um  Oxford  row  coach  welcome  back   sir.  Uh,  we  need  some  positivivity.   Maybe  Guy  and  Nick  could  do  a  duet  to   entertain  us  or  a  comedy  double  act.  I   mean,  this  this  kind  of  is  a  comedy   double  act.  I  mean,  this  is  as  good  as   you'll  get.  A  duet.  I  I  don't  think   Look,  people  are  already  depressed.  We   don't  need  We  don't  need  Nick  and  I   singing  a  duet.   >> We  can't  lose  the  last  10  of  our   viewers.   >> Yes,  exactly.

Um  uh   Brett,  meanwhile,  the  trolling   continues.  Biggest  threat  to  my   portfolio  is  guy's  TA.  You  better   believe  it,  Brett.  You  better  believe   it.  I'm  coming  for  your  TA.  If  I  if  I   get  if  we  get  to  those  thousand  likes   and  I  get  to  do  the  TA,  I'll  be  going   hard  on  your  portfolio,  Brett.  Um  I  like   this  from  uh  space.youtube.  It's  almost   like  crypto  has  buyers  remorse.   >> Oh  man.   >> Um  and  then  the  clown  uh  clown  cockney,   which  is  ever  so  slightly  sinister.   Should  I  do  this  in  a  cockney  accent?  Go   ahead.  The  bomb  won't  be  in  until   sailor's  liquidated.  Who  actually   believes  he'd  be  allowed  to  own  the  most   Bitcoin?  Laughing  emoji.   There  we  are.  Um,  I  hope  you  are  a  true   cockney,  sir.  In  which  case,  don't  be   too  offended.  And,  uh,  Kian  was  a  little   late  to  the  party.  Sorry  I'm  late.  All   positive  news,  right?  Yeah.  Everything's   going  to  be  fine.  Don't  worry,  man.   We're  going  to  the  moon,  bro.  We're   going  to  the  moon.  It's  all  good.   >> Okay.  Tariffs,  guys.  Let's  talk  about   it.  As  you  know,  it's  been  the  word  that   has  dogged  the  crypto  markets  for  the   whole  of  last  year.  Indeed,  it  caused   was  one  of  the  initial  catalysts  of  the   massive  1010  meltdown.   >> Yeah.   >> And  all  to  think  that  all  of  that  was   for  nothing  because  as  absolutely  almost   nothing.   Oh  god,  this  gets  worse,  doesn't  it?  It   just  gets  worse.  I  guess  because  as  we   mentioned  on  the  stream  last  week   actually  that  there  was  a  potential   ruling  on  the  20th  of  February  and   indeed  the  Kelshi  odds  prior  to  that   were  looking  as  if  it  was  going  to  be   that  the  court  was  going  to  decide   against  it  and  indeed  they  did.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  So  another  win  for  the   prediction  markets  there.  Now  just  in   case  you're  not  not  up  to  speed  with   what  exactly  happened.  Uh  so  the  the   Supreme  Court  um  of  the  United  States   ruled  6  to3  um  that  Trump  had  exceeded   his  executive  authority  in  imposing   these  tariffs.  Now  you  might  remember   these  tariffs  were  imposed  without  uh   any  even  consultation  of  Congress.  Trump   basically  did  them  by  uh  executive   order.  Yeah.  Um,  so  they  were,  you  know,   obviously  they  were  controversial   because  of  what  they  were,  you  know,   because  of  the  sheer,  you  know,  numbers   involved,  um,  and  the  geopolitical   consequences  of  them,  but  they  were  also   very  controversial  because  they  were   kind  of  done  unilaterally  by  by  Trump,   by  the  White  House.  Um,  so  this  was,  uh,   this  was  obviously  challenged  uh,  in  the   Supreme  Court,  you  know,  the  highest   court  in  the  land.  And  what  is   particularly  interesting  I  think  about   this  63  ruling  is  that  you  know  Trump   has  over  the  course  especially  in  his  uh   in  his  first  term  Trump  managed  to   actually  stuff  the  Supreme  Court  with   quite  a  lot  of  you  know  people  who  were   you  know  his  seem  to  be  his  allies.  He   has  got  a  lot  of  uh  people  more  to  the   right  of  the  political  spectrum  in  there   over  the  last  few  years.  Um,  so  he  must   have  kind  of  thought  uh  that  they  were   going  to  go  along  with  with  him  on  that   one.   >> Yeah,  he  did.  But  to  be  fair  to  him,  he   actually  took  it  quite  surprisingly  well   uh  when  they  when  they   >> Oh,  yes,  of  course.  No,  that's  obviously   sarcasm.  He  he  he  bashed  them  as  quote   unpatriotic  justices.  Uh  he  he  labeled   the  decision  as  a  disgrace  specifically   targeting  his  own  nominee.   Gorchits  and  Barrett  for  joining  the   majority.  Oh  my  gosh.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.   >> Yeah.  So  uh  yeah,  disloyalty  um  in  in   Trump  world  in  Trump  land  does  not  go   down  well.  So  uh  yeah,  I  uh  I  imagine   it's  probably  a  little  uncomfortable   being  one  of  those  Supreme  Court   justices  at  the  moment.  But  yeah,  as   Nick  says,  Trump  was  understandably  I   guess  pretty  furious  about  this.  Um,  and   yeah,  it  basically  I  guess  if  you  could   sum  it  up  all  in  one  word,  uh,  in   especially  in  terms  of  what  it  has   unleashed,  I  think  that  word  would  be    show.  It  has.  Yeah.  Now  in  terms  of   what  happens  from  here,  well  first  of   all  first  of  all  in  Trump  immediately   responded  a  few  hours  later  he  had  a  new   strategy  and  he  signed  a  executive  order   for  a  temporary  10%  global  tariff  under   a  under  section  122  of  the  1974  trade   act.   >> Okay.  Uh  then  on  Saturday  uh  he  actually   increased  this  to  15.   Now,  um,  so  this  15%  tariff  is   authorized  for  up  to  150  days  per   section  per  that,  uh,  section  of  the   trade  act  that  Nick  mentioned,  um,  with   plans  for  more  permanent  levies  later   on.   >> Yeah,  exactly.  Now,  um,  this  really   important  point  here  that  was  put  out  on   a  tweet  and  it's  a  good  one.  It's  the   problem  is  if  you're  a  if  it's  about   leverage,  if  tariffs  are  about  leverage   and  you're  an  adversary  or  another   trading  partner,  how  much  leverage  of   leverage  are  you  going  to  actually  get   against  that  trading  partner?  If  you   know  that  this  is  potentially  going  to   disappear  in  150  days  and  similarly  the   whole  goal  of  tariffs  was  was  to  be   about  onshoring  jobs  manufacturers  would   adjust  that  bring  jobs  back  to  America.   Who  on  earth  is  going  to  plan  and  and   for  this  assuming  that  the  tariff  is   going  to  be  removed  in  150  days?  So  it's   quite  ridiculous.   >> Yeah.  Now  uh  one  of  the  one  of  the   features  of  this  Supreme  Court  decision   uh  means  that  there  is  now  you  know  a   question  of  well  does  the  revenue  raised   from  these  tariffs  so  far  which  is   around  $175   billion  uh  is  this  now  going  to  be   redistributed  to  uh  to  those  who  those   who've  had  to  pay  it.   >> Yeah.  Well  the  people  who've  actually   had  to  pay  it  are  the  consumers  but  of   course  the  companies  are  the  one  who's   who  ones  who's  asking  for  that  tariff   the  tariff  uh  revenue  back.  Uh  so   there's  about  $175  billion  and  companies   are  actually  now  suing  Trump's  or   planned  to  sue  the  Trump  administration   to  get  some  of  that  back.   >> Yeah.  And  of  course  that  Supreme  Court   case  was  originally  brought  by  uh  a   consortium  of  companies  I  believe.  Um  so   uh  yeah  and  and  kind  of  the  some  of  the   madness  of  this  is  that  he's  now  talking   about  um  you  know  he  was  mentioning  that   some  of  this  revenue  could  be  used  to   pay  off  the  national  debt.  uh  you  know,   some  of  it  obviously  a  tiny  a  tiny   slither  slither  of  it  given  that  the   national  debt  is  now  about  $  38   trillion.  Um  but  he  was  also  talking   about  $2,000  dividends.  So,   >> you  know,  if  that  was  to  go  ahead   basically  giving  it  back  to  paid  in  the   first  place.   >> Exactly.  Well,  I  mean,  what  a  lopsided   way  of  doing  it.  I  mean,  if  that  works.   Anyways,  in  terms  of  the  market   reaction,  equities  catch  a  much  needed   boost  on  the  day.  We  had  retailers  and   luxury  stocks  initially  rallying.  Um  but   we  also  had  European  stocks  which   surged.  Right.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  So,  ironically  enough,   Trump's  tariffs  have  been  great  for   Europe.   >> Massively,  especially  over  the  past  year   if  you've  seen  the  performance,  not  just   in  terms  of  absolute  but  also  relative   because  the  euro  has  been  up  a  lot.   >> Yeah.   >> So,  yeah.   >> Okay.  Uh  who  would  have  thought  Trump   would  Trump  would  be  good  news  for   Europe.  Um  so,  there  are  also  as  I   mentioned  um  the  I  mentioned  the   national  debt.  There  are  also  concerns   around  the  deficit  as  well.  Um  this  is   uh  this  this  Supreme  Court  ruling  has  uh   has  thrown  the  cat  among  the  pigeons   there.  Obviously  bond  yields  yields  I   should  say  rose  um  as  traders  worried   that  basically  you  know  these  refunds   would  force  the  Treasury  to  you  know   basically  issue  more  debt.   >> Um  and  that  would  only  kind  of  widen  the   deficit.   >> Yeah.  The  impact  on  crypto  though,  well,   for  once,  thank  God,   that's  the  wrong  chart.  I  mean,  for   once,  a  tariff  headline  that  didn't   actually  tank  Bitcoin's  price.  Um,  it's   a  miracle  really,   >> but  it  also  didn't  do  much  in  terms  of  a   rally.  Bitcoin's  like  Bitcoin's  like   done  nothing.  Well,  subsequent  to  that,   it  obviously  crashed  over  the  weekend,   but  Bitcoin  didn't  move.  But  let's  and   then  also  this  is  surprising  because  as   you  recall  as  we  mentioned  if  you'll  not   forget  uh  that  the  1010  was  caused  by  um   the  Trump  uh  the  Trump  tariffs.  I  think   that  the  refunds  that  Trump  wants  to   give  for  the  tariffs  at  least  some  of   that  should  go  to  all  the  crypto  traders   who  lost  the  billions   subsequent  to  that  liquidation  event.   I'm  sure  that  is  an  idea  that  would  be   wholeheartedly  supported  by  most  of  the   American  public.   >> Oh  yes.   >> Given  crypto's  immense  popularity  and   the  immense  well  of  good   >> such  loved  community  feeling  towards  the   crypto  industry  that  we've  managed  to   that  we've  managed  to  cultivate  over  all   those  years.  I'm  sure  I'm  sure  people   across  the  United  States  will  be  saying   yes  give  that  money  back  to  the  crypto   bros.  don't  cross  the  political   spectrum.  Our  our  purpose  resonates  with   them.   >> The  United  States  will  be  united  like    talk  our  industry  more  than  anyone   really  does.  Uh  but  um  if  the  if  refunds   are  given  to  companies,  it  could  be  a   fiscal  boost  and  risk  assets  could   climb.  But  again,  that's  a  long  way   away.  Court  cases  etc.  But  the  biggest   benefit  well  we  say  this  now  is  that   it's  less  weight  to  the  erratic  trade   policy  because  now  we  they  have  some   degree  of  certainty.  I  do  feel  sorry  for   the  for  all  the  countries  that  basically   agreed  to  these  exorbitant  investment   programs  in  the  US  on  this  on  the  basis   they  would  get  less  like  the  UK  bad  luck   UK  literally  they  go  out  there  like   praising  Trump's  feats  and  everything   kio  and  all  that  to  get  a  great  trade   deal  and  now  the  base  rate  is  like   >> yeah  well  I  mean  looking  at  the  you  know   looking  in  at  at  the  media  sort  of  front   pages  now  you  know  all  all  the  media   sites  now  like  as  I  said  earlier  the   overwhelming  sense  is  confusion  because   like  now  really  no  one  knows  what  what   to  do.  And  I  think  this  is  I  mean,  you   know,  you  could  argue  that  this  is  going   to  be  good  for  markets  in  some  of  the   ways  that  we  outline,  but  really  I  think   this  is  just  sort  of  more  just  pandemon   more  uncertainty,  more  pandemonium.   Like,  you  know,  people  just  companies,   businesses  just  aren't  going  to  be  able   to  make  any  plans  because  they  just   don't  know  what's  what's  going  to  come   next.   >> Yeah,  100%.  And  if  you  guys  want  to  make   the  most  of  these  turbulent  market   environments  in  crypto  or  indeed  any   sort  of  assets,  gold,  commodities,   trady,  then  the  best  place  to  be  doing   that  is  over  on  Bitgget,  our  second   brand  partner.  Now  you  can  use,  first  of   all,  you  can,  if  you  don't  have  a  Bit   account,  you  can  sign  up  right  now,   scanning  the  QR  code  on  the  screen  or   hitting  the  link  in  the  description.  Uh,   and  you  can  swap  your  Bitcoin  for  USDT   and  then  you  can  trade  tokenized  gold   and  other  assets,  stocks  as  well.  Uh,   and  it's  up  to  500  times  leverage  and  of   course  deep  liquidity  and  low  slippage.   And  also,  if  you  sign  up  with  our  link   or  the  QR  code,  you  could  potentially   get  up  to  $50,000  in  deposit  bonuses.   So,  go  ahead,  do  that,  guys,  and  claim   yourself  a  deposit  bonus.  Trade  some   gold  and  make  a  killing.   >> Yes,  trade  trade  some  gold.   Don't  touch  crypto  for  goodness  sake.   Okay,  now  we've  uh  we've  been  very   negative  about  crypto  as  a  whole  over   the  course  of  this  stream.  Um,  for  good   reason,  but  it  would  be  remiss  of  us  if   we  didn't  uh  look  for  the  positives  in   crypto  as  well.  And  believe  it  or  not,   there  are  some  out  there.  Um,  and  one  of   the  biggest  is  uh  so-called  agentic   finance.  Um,  now  you'll  probably  have   heard  of  us  talking  about  the  X42   protocol  uh  a  bit  before  either  in  these   live  streams  or  we've  done  a  couple  of   uh  videos  about  them  on  this  on  this   channel  as  well.  So,  um,  we  thought  we'd   there there's  been  a  lot  happening  in   the  agentic  payments/x402   space.  So,  we  wanted  to  bring  you  up  to   speed  on  that  because  I  don't  know  I   don't  know  about  you,  Nick,  but  I   personally  think  uh  this  is  probably   crypto's   brightest  spot  at  the  moment  in  terms  of   in  terms  of  potential,  in  terms  of  what   it  might  do  for  the  space,  in  terms  of   how  crypto  might  actually  sort  of  prove   itself  to  some  of  the  naysayers  in  the   big  wide  world.  I  mean,  are  you  are  you   with  me  on  that?   >> Yeah,  I  think  so.  I  mean  for  one  it's  if   you're  bullish  on  these  two  particular   narratives  and  the  intersection  of  them.   So  one  is  if  you're  bullish  on  a  agents   AI  agents  which  it  seems  to  be  now  with   all  the  release  of  these  claude  bot  and   all  that  and  also  if  you're  bullish  on   stable  coin  finance  because  these  bots   are  going  to  have  to  speak  to  each  other   um  these  agents.   >> So  this  is  the  meta  right  now.  It  is  AI.   Yeah,  indeed  it  has.  It  is  getting  a  lot   of  the  attention  now  on  crypto  Twitter   because  it's  one  of  the  only  narratives   left  to  pin  pin  our  hopes  on.   >> Yeah.   >> So,  yeah,  that  is  that  is  us  coming  to   you  right  now  at  the  in  the  bathroom  and   letting  you  know  about  uh  the  Aentic   Finance  and  Meta.   >> Next  time  you're  stood  at  the  urinal,   just  just  you  just  you  watch  out.  You   never  you  never  know.  Someone  might  come   and  talk  to  you  about  uh  stable  coin   payments  for  Agentic  Finance.  Now,  um,   just  a  quick  refresh  in  case  you're   unfamiliar,  in  case  you've  zoned  out,  in   case  your  eyes  have  glazed  over  every   time  we  talked  about  this.  What  is  X42?   Well,  basically  X42  is  an  opensource   payment  protocol.  It's  been  developed  by   Coinbase  uh  in  collaboration  with   Cloudflare,  I  believe,  um,  the  big  sort   of  uh,  web  infrastructure  uh,  company.   Um,  now,  interestingly,  you'll  probably   be  familiar  with  um,  uh,  with  a  404   error,  page  not  found.  Um  that  is  that   obviously  goes  back  to  the  early  days  of   the  internet  but  um  in  the  1990s  they   actually  reserved  uh  402  as  well.   >> Yeah  exactly  for  payments  but  never   implemented  it.  And  the  problem  is   basically  most  traditional  payments  you   think  Visa  and  Mastercard  etc.  Uh  they   require  biometrics  or  multiffactor   authentication.  AI  agents  of  course   don't  have  thumbs  or  faces  to  scan.   >> Not  yet.   >> Not  yet  at least.  Yeah.  Um  so  X42   absolves  uh  this  by  embedding  stable   coin  payments  uh  directly  into  the  HTTP   protocol  through  request  response   handshakes.   >> Yeah.  So  the  result  is  that  you  know  a   AI  agents  that  implement  that  are  you   know  plugged  into  X42  they  can  basically   now  if  you  like  kind  of  pay  as  they  go   for  things  like  API  calls  for  GPU  power   for  data  you  know  a  lot  of these  data   websites  that  they're  visiting  because   uh  something  I  was  unaware  of  until   quite  recently  is  that  quite  a  lot  of   data  sites  now  actively  block  you  can   you  know  you  can  block  AI  uh  AI  agents   particularly  AI  scrapers  as  well.   >> Um  and  still  allow  human  users  through.   Now  what  this  basically  gives  the  gives   them  the  opportunity  for  is  to  say  well   rather  than  block  you  you  can  pay   instead.   >> Exactly.  Yeah.  And  if  you're  going  to   pay  why  not  use  an  internet  native   currency  like  a  stable  coin.   >> Yeah.   >> So  uh  there's  this  machine  to  this   concept  of  machine  toachine  commerce   where  stable  coins  are  becoming  the   native  currency  of  the  AI  economy   because  they  are  programmable  24/7  and   settle  instantly.  And  unlike  legacy   banks  that  close  at  5:00  p.m.,  an  AI   agent  can  detect  a  yield  opportunity  or   a  price  discrepancy  at  3:00  a.m.  and   execute  a  stable  coin  swap  immediately.   Yeah.  So,  and  yeah,  I  mean  this  kind  of,   you  know,  this  kind  of  gives  AI  agents   this  sort  of  plugandplay  kind  of  agency   really.  Um,  and  there  are  a  lot  of   developments  happening  around  this.  X402   launched  sort  of  last  year,  but  there's   been  a  lot  happen  since  then.  Coinbase   recently  launched  uh  what  they're   calling  agentic  wallets  that  this   basically  allows  a  developer  to  give  any   any  AI  agent  its  own  sort  of  financial   identity.  Um  and  this  can  all  be  done   you  know  in  minutes.   >> Yeah.  Exactly.  Now  the  impact   potentially  this  concept  of  the  agent  to   agent  econ  economies.  So  we  moving   toward  a  world  where  AI  agent  for   example  like  let's  say  a  researcher   hires  another  AI  agent  potentially  like   a  translator   >> and  pays  it  in  stable  coins  via  X42.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  And  and  you  know  this  is   going  to  this  is  basically  going  to   enable  sort  of  if  you  like  kind  of   streaming  payments  I  guess.  So,  you   know,  just  imagine  an  AI  agent  paying,   you  know,  fractions  of  a  cent  uh  every   second  for  access  to  like,  you  know,  say   a  high-speed  financial  data  feed  or   something  like  that.   >> So,  I  mean,  the  possibilities  for  this   are  enormous.   >> Exactly.  Yeah.  And   >> and  if  it's  like  like  what  people  are   asking  now  probably  on  the  audience  like   how  do  I  make  money  from  this  as  per   usual?  I  I  guess  one  of the  ways  is  if   you  look  at  the  underlying   infrastructure  and  if  you  think  that  in   terms  of  stable  coin  finance  where  is   most  of  these  stable  coins  issued  these   days  right   >> yeah  well  yeah  still  on  Ethereum   >> still  Ethereum  right  so   >> despite  the  fact  that  Vitalic  may  be   selling  his  bags  regularly  um  the   Ethereum  itself  is  still  uh  the  main   place  where  stable  coins  and  indeed  most   RWA  are  issued   >> and  if  you  are  of  the  view  that  Agentic   Finance  is  going  to  take  off  and  this  is   also  actually  interesting  guys  because   in  the  context.  I  don't  know  guy  did  you   see  today  there  was  this  release  of  this   research  report  by  Citrine  Research.  it   was  it's  basically  making  the  rounds  on   Twitter  and  it  was  this  argument  around   it  was  kind  of  a  doomer  post  on  AI  how   it's  going to  take  over  everyone's  job   and  all  that  but  they  made  a  point   around  specifically  and  they  mentioned   um  agentic  payments  and  how  things  like   stable  coins  are  the  way  in  which  these   payments  can  be  made  and  it's  terrible   terrible  news  for  the  business  model  of   the  likes  of  Visa  and  Mastercard  but   great  for  crypto  networks  that  where   these  stable  coins  are  processed  and  and   settled  on  so  yeah  if  you're  bullish  on   stable  coin  if  you  bullish  on  aentic   stable  coin  finance   >> then  Ethereum  probably  is  a  good  bet.   >> Yeah,  I  think  Ethereum  some  of  its  layer   2  like  base.  I  also  kind  of  think   although  stable  coins  on  Salana  haven't   got  anything  like  the  market  cap  of   Ethereum,  Salana  is  extremely  fast  and   extremely  cheap  as  well.  And  I  think  if   Agentic  Payments  take  off,  then  I  think   we're  probably  most  likely  to  see  them   on  networks  like  Bass  obviously  because   you  know  Coin  Coinbase  developed  X42,   but  I  would  imagine  Salana  would  be  in   the  game  there  as  well.  So   >> there's  a  couple  to  look  out  for.  You   can  also  there  is  an  X42  tab  on  uh  Coin   Gecko  um  with  some  more  sort  of   >> smaller  X42  projects.  Now  obviously   given  the  state  of  not  just  the  crypto   market  but  particularly  the  altcoin   market,  those  are  obviously  a  lot  more   risky.  Yeah,   >> but  if  you're  interested  in  this,   you  know,  checking  that  tab  out  and  some   of  the  projects  of  genuinely  quite   interesting  in  what  they're  trying  to  do   and  what  they're  trying  to  achieve.  So,   there  is  a  bit  of  good  news.   >> There's  some  good  news.   >> Crypto  good  news,  folks.  This,  I  think,   could  be  the  moment  where  crypto  sort  of   bursts  a  bit  more  into  the  mainstream   and  goes,  \"This  is  what  I'm  for.   >> There's  this  is  what  crypto  is  for.   product  market  fit  for  the  agents  that   are  going  to  overtake  all  of  our  jobs,   at least  they'll  be  able  to  transact   with  each  other.   >> At  least  when  at  least  when  AI  agents   take  our  jobs,  they  can  now  get  paid.   >> Exactly.  Anyways,  guys,  it's  time  for   the  TA  section.  And  Lewis  is  still  away,   so  we  thought  we'd  bring  back  by  popular   demand,  you  guys.  It's  Aaron  from  the   Coin  Bureau  Trading  Channel.  So,  Aaron,   take  it  away  with  your  TA.  Aaron  scans   the  charts  trend  tight  and  true   bear  tells  EXACTLY  WHAT  TO  DO.  HEY  GUYS,   it's  me  Aaron  Dishner  from  the  better   traders  here  for  Coin  Bureau  giving  you   a  3minut  market  update.  Let's  go.  So  BTC   had  a  pretty  surprising  start  to  the  day   as  you  all  know.  In  about  2  hours  it   dropped  4.79%.   Now  what  exactly  caused  this  dump?  Not   really  sure,  but  it  doesn't  matter   because  that's  a  pretty  nasty  break  of   support.  BTC  has  now  officially  put  in  a   lower  low.  And  for  those  of  you  that   have  been  keeping  track  with  me,  this  is   still  a  valid  bare  flag  break.  So,  if   this  is  actually  going  to  be  a  real  bare   flag  for  BTC,  what  we're  going  to  want   to  see  happen  next,  now  that  we've  seen   a  drop  of  support,  making  a  low,  we're   going  to  want  to  see  it  go  back  up  to   test  previously  lost  support,  which   would  then  switch  it  to  be  resistance   and  we  fall  lower.  Again,  this  is  the   same  exact  setup  that  happened  over   here.  We  saw  tag  resistance  and  BTC   dropped  a  lot  more.  The  chart  still   strong  bearish.  It's  still  looking   really  weak  on  the  daily  time  frame  as   well  as  on  the  weekly  time  frame  on  all   metrics,  on  all  indicators.  Super  strong   bearish.  No  big  changes  there.  Stable   coin  dominance  as  a  result  pushed  up  a   lot  higher.  We  saw  it  go  up  in  total   about  4.57%  today.  Note  that  it's  right   under  TBO  resistance  at  11.521%.   Now,  even  if  this  was  a  fake  out  and  we   see  Bitcoin  go  up  higher  and  stable  coin   dominance  go  back  lower,  the  reality  is   that  this  is  still  a  super  duper  strong   bullish  TBO  cloud,  which  means  that  even   if  we  get  a  pullback,  we  should  see  a   bigger  move  to  the  top  side.  And  that's   actually  what  I'm  expecting  on  the   weekly  time  frame.  Both  stable  coin   dominance  and  Bitcoin  are  showing  signs   that  we're  very  much  near  the   capitulation  phase  of  this  bare  market,   which  is  great.  which  means  that  the   bottom  is  a  lot  closer  than  it  was  at   the  beginning,  a  couple  months  ago.  Last   but  not  least,  gold  is  actually  waking   up.  And  you  know what's  helpful  to  make   that  happen  is  instability  in  the   geopolitical  landscape  and  also  in  the   financial  landscape.  And  of  course,   President  Trump  and  the  US  saying,   \"Well,  I  don't  care  what  the  US  Supreme   Court  does.  I'm  just  going  to  slap  on  um   15%  tariffs  for  everyone.\"  Of  course,   we're  going  to  see  gold  go  up  higher.   There's  two  things  to  pay  attention  to.   For  starters,  gold  is  now  above  this   shortterm  Fibonacci  retracement  from   here  from  5600  down  here  to  $4,400.  The   fact  that  it's  now  opening  and  will  most   likely  hold  above  this  618  Fibonacci   level,  which  is  the  golden  level  as   everyone  likes  to  call  it,  it's  a  big   deal.  I  personally  am  still  expecting   gold  to  eventually,  not  right  away,  but   eventually  move  up  here  towards  $6,500   because  I  don't  see  any  signs  of  the   world  slowing  down  in  terms  of   geopolitical  tension.  Um,  financial   landscape  is  still  very,  very  weak,   especially  for  the  United  States.  So,   gold  is  telling  us  that  we  should  see  it   moving  up  higher.  And  if  gold  is  moving   up,  most  certainly  we're  going  to  see   Bitcoin  go  in  the  opposite  direction  to   lower  lows.   >> Wow.  Okay.  So,  6,500  for  gold.  Wow.   Bullish  call  there.  Yeah.  Thanks  a  lot,   mate.   >> It's  time  for  tweets  of  the  week,  guys.   >> Oh,  no  jingle.  Okay,   >> no  jingle.  Okay,  we  cut  the  jingle.   Okay,   >> times  are  tough.  You  know,  bare  market.   We  got  to  we  got  to  strip  this  right   back.   >> We  can't  afford   Can't  afford  the  jiggle  anymore.  Okay.   Scotty  Pippen.  Um  uh  this  uh  I'm   confused,  Nick.  I  thought  Scotty  Pippen   was  a  basketball  player.   >> I  thought  so,  too.  But  it  seems  he's   pivoted  into  a  amateur  crypto  TA   professional  because  uh  he  shared  two   kind  of  really  weird  and  fake  Well,  one   was  completely  wrong  and  the  other  was   fake.  So,  I  mean,  the  first  one  on  the   left  there,  and  both  were  also  stolen,   by  the  way.  I  put  it  out  pointed  out   that  they  weren't  his  own  posts.  Um,  so   he  wasn't  the  the  to  post  them,   but  the  originally  designed  it,   but  he  did  post  it.  First  one  is  um  he   he's  got  a  quote  there,  Bitcoin  with  a   actually  a  bearish,  you  know,  a  bare   flag  formation,   which  um  is  surprising  because  I  don't   know  if  he  was  trying  to  imply  that   things  about  to  go  crazy.  Uh  but  what  in   fact  did  happen  as  what  usually  happens   with  Bitcoin  bare  flag  with  a  bare  flag   is  that  it  did  break  lower.  So,  he   posted  the  correct  chart  to  but  just  not   the  way  he  thought  it  was  going  to  go.   And  then  the  second  chart  there,  this  is   hilarious  because  he's  not  the  only  one   who  shared  this.  Like  I  said,  everyone   was  sharing  this  on  crypto  Twitter,   which  is  so  stupid  because  the  chart  on   the  right,  you  can't  see  um  that  that   chart  is  actually  from  2025,  I  think,   and  it  was  invalidated.  So,  it  was   completely  invalidated.  So,  you  post   basically  people  are  posting  fake   charts.   >> Okay.  Okay.  So,  yeah.  Okay.  So,  we've   got  this.  I  mean,  this  is  surreal  on  so   many  levels,  isn't  it?  We  got  Scotty   Pippen,  famous  once  once  upon  a  time   basketball  player,  pivoting  into  crypto   at  possibly  the  worst  possible  time.   Yeah,  to  be  fair,  he's  been  talking   about  crypto  for  he's  been  napping  off   about  crypto  for  a  little  bit.   >> He  says  he  met  Satoshi  once.   >> Oh,  right.  Okay.   >> He  was  the  guy  who  said  that  when  he  was   with  Michael  Sailor,  I  think.   >> Okay.  Um,  and  now  posting  nonsense  on   Twitter.  I  mean,  so  what  what's  next?   Dennis  Rodman  with  XRP,   >> bro.  I  mean,  what's  Yeah.  What  cycle  are   we  in?  What  what  stage  of  the  cycle  is   this?  I  don't  know,  man.   >> I  I  don't  know.  I  All  I  know  is  I  don't   like  it.   >> Okay.  Uh  moving  on  from  Scotty  Pippen.   Um  yes.  Okay.  So,  this  is  uh  this  is   more  from  this  open  claw.  So,  um  this  is   someone  complaining  that  they  got   blocked  from  the  open  claw  discord  for   saying  the  word  bitcoin.  Um  Peter   Steinberger  is  the  guy  who  uh  came  up   with  open  claw.  Um  open  claw  should  say.   Uh  we  have  strict  server  rules  that  you   accepted  when  you  enter  the  server.  No   crypto  mentioned  whatsoever  is  one  of   them.   >> Yeah,  man.  The  bro  literally  was   harassed  so  badly  that  e  even  the  site   the  mention  of  Bitcoin  or  I  mean  to  be   fair,  you  know,  Bitcoin  is  technically   not  I  mean  it  is  a  cryptocurrency  but   Bitcoin  is  we'll  say  it's  not  crypto  but   >> yeah,  he  just  can't  can't  be  bothered.   It's  like  anything  to  do  with  uh   cryptocurrency  at  all.  No  mention.   >> We  did  this  to  ourselves.   >> Um  but  uh  there  is  some  good  news  out   there.  uh  X  is  pushing  back  against  uh   undisclosed  shills.   >> Great.  I  think  to  be  honest,  this  is   good.  I  mean,  no  more  of  the  undisclosed   shills  on  Twitter,  right?  All  these   people  with  these  projects  and   everything.  So,  if  it's  something  that   uh  concerned  people,  it's  because  they   weren't  doing  it  right.  Just  to  disclose   who  you  partnered  with.   >> Yeah.   >> Um   >> now,  um  we've  got  a  we've  got  a  little   cluster  of  tweets  here.  Um  because,  uh   they  are  all  pushing  back  on  the   president  of  the  United  States.  Yes.  We   we  laid  into  him  at  the  top  of  the   stream  and  we're  coming  back  to  lay  into   him.  Um  what's  the  sort  of  theme  here?   >> My  my  you  know  how  Twitter's  algorithm   works  now.  If  you  engage  with  one  of   these,  you  basically  get  sent  50   different  ones.  So  I  was  like,  \"Oh,   >> this  is  hilarious.\"  I  mean,  but  yeah,  I   mean  the  really  funny  one  there  is  by   Runner  XBT.  Camala  and  Gensler  2028.  So   coins  can  go  up.  Actually,   I  mean  to  be  honest,  bro,  I  I  I  don't   think  it  would  be  that  much  that  much   worse  to  be  honest.  At least  against   like  there's  some  arguments  to  be  made.   The  one  in  the  first  one,  Chimpy  Chimpu   basically  made  the  argument  that  at   least  he  pursued  bad  actors  and  scams   and  let  the  cryp  let  the  crypto  market   have  a  bit  of  a  pump.  I  I  mean,  I'm  I   I'm  not  entirely  with  him  there.  Like  I   I  I  do  think  I  do  think  there's  a  point   to  be  made  there,  but  uh  I  still  I  stand   by  the  fact  that  Gary  Gendler's  approach   to  regulation  was  wrong.  It  maybe  his   maybe  his  thinking  was  right,  but  he   went  about  it  in  the  wrong  way.  Um  but   you  know,  uh  it's  yeah,  I  mean  just  the   fact  that  we  are  basically  basically   homesick  for  basically  nostalgic.   >> It's  crazy,  bro.  The  the  devil,  you   know.  Anyways,  dates  the  diary.  Uh   tomorrow  we've  got  consumer  confidence   data  for  February.  Uh  Wednesday  is  a  big   day  because  we've  got  Nvidia  earnings   and  it  would  it  would  have  a  massive   impact  on  the  stock  market.   >> Mhm.   >> Thursday  initial  job  list  claims.  Keep   those  on  the  on  your  radar.  And  then   Friday  we  have  PPI,  the  producer  price   inflation  numbers  coming  out.   >> Um  and  uh  we  also  have  11  Fed  governors   speaking  during  the  week.  So  11.  So   there'll  be  some  volatility.  Yeah.   >> Gosh.  So,  if  you're  one  of  those  people   who  just  who  who  loves  nothing  more  than   listening  to  a  Fed  governor,   >> nothing.   >> This  is  the  week  for  you.   >> If  Fed  speak  gets  you  going  and  hot   under  the  collar,  get  set,  guys,   >> cuz  you  got  11  of  them.  11  Fed  governors   to  listen  to  this  week.  You  lucky  lucky   people.  Gosh,  we  uh  we  don't  deserve  it.   Um  okay,  Nick,  uh  I  will  um  I'll  fill   you  in  on  some  of  the  comments  um  that   we're  getting.  Uh,  trash  from  the   underground  says  lots  of  talk  around   October.  Yes,  if  you've  been  watching   NFA  live  streams,  Ben  Cowan,  who  has  uh   who  has  been  um  who's  been  right  about  a   lot  of  things  uh  of  late,  he  reckons   that  we  are  probably  going  to  bottom   around  maybe   >> and  that  things  could  start  looking  up   again  in  October  ahead  of  the  midterm   elections.  So,  um  yeah,  let's  see.  Let's   see.  Um  people  are  people  are  calling   for  cousin  Barry  TA.  I  mean,  we're  still   only  on  30%  likes,  guys.  I  can  tell  you   I  can  tell  you  right  now  Barry  does  not   get  out  of  bed  for  under  50%.  So,  um,   you  know,  you've  got  to  keep  smashing   that  like  button.  Um,  can  someone  give   me  the  reference  here?  Nick's  hair  has   Mishuga  lead  guitarist  vibes.   >> Mug.  What  the  hell?   >> I  haven't  I  haven't  heard  of  Mishuga.   Um,  I'm  going  to  have  to  Google  that  on   my  spare  time.  Um,  and  there's  some  love   for  your  mustache,  Nick,  as  well.  Nick   >> mustache.   >> Oh,  I'm  just  googling  your  mug.  I  need   to  see.   >> Um,   >> the  guy's  bald.   >> Oh.   >> Oh,  no.  There's  another  one  there.  Okay,   fine.  Fine.  Interesting.   >> There's  There's  a  non-bald.   >> There's  non  fine.  Fine.   >> Okay.  Um,  yes.  So,  uh,  people  generally   uh  people  generally  loving  your  look,   Nick.  Um,  uh,  what  else?  Uh,  Queen  Beer   Sander,  I  didn't  have  my  limit  orders   set  at  64K  over  the  weekend.  Guess  I'll   catch  it  next  weekend.  I  mean,  I  think   you  can  probably  probably  turn  those   limit  orders  a  little  lower.   >> Yeah,  it'll  just  go  below  the  200E   moving  average.  Maybe  to  be  safe  the  300   week  moving  average  or  you  know   >> or  the  400  week  who  knows  who  knows   these  moving  averages  are  just  getting   blasted  through.  Um  uh  Nick  geopolitical   questions.  Will  the  UA  UAE  real  estate   tank  when  Iran  is  attacked?   >> I  hope  not  man.  That's  the  only  thing   that's  going  well  for  my  portfolio.   Please  no.   The  only  thing  that's  up  the  past  few   years  for  me   a  stray  cruise  missile  hit  Nick's  hits   Nick's  investment  property.   >> If  ever  if  ever  Nick  is  absent  from  the   stream,  guys,  you'll  know  he's  either   eaten  some  dodgy  oysters  or  or  Iran  has   attacked  his  has  attacked  his  investment   property.  Um  let's  uh  let's  hope  not.  I   think  I  think  it  would  take  more.  I   think  it  would  take  more  than  that.  A   lot  more  than  that.  Um,  and  lots  of  love   for  Aaron  as  well.  We  should  say  Lewis   hasn't  been  hasn't  been  replaced.  He  he   hasn't  been  uh  sent  into  the  wilderness   because  uh  because  he  sold  all  his   crypto  and  moved  into  Metals.  Um  he  is   just  taking  some  time  off  to  uh  to  to   get  some  stuff  done.  Um  so  we  are   expecting  him  back  fairly  soon.  So  don't   worry.  Um   >> he'll  be  back.  He'll  be  back.  And  uh   yeah  um  we  well  on  the  likes  front  guys   we  haven't  got   >> funnly  enough  we  actually  I  think  30%  is   closer  than  we've  got  in  a  lot  of  weeks.   >> Well  yeah   >> we  got  to  we  got  to  adjust  the  numbers   down.  I  think  we  this  is  a  bit   embarrassing.  We  may  make  it  500  next   week.  just  I  mean  by   >> by  the  by  the  next  few  months  in  three   months  time  it's  going  to  be  great  guys   you  know   >> by  May  by  May  it'll  be  like  okay  if  we   can  just  get  to  10  likes  for  the  day   then  then  guy  then  guy  will  set  himself   on  fire  hurl  himself  out  of  the  out  of   the  floor  of  the  skyscraper  for  your   delation.  Um,  look,  you  know,  one  day,   Nick,  when  when  when  the  bull  market  has   returned,  when  crypto  has  come  out  of   its  current  identity  crisis  and   reasserted  itself,  found  its  confidence,   found  its  found  its  vibe  again,  and   we've  got  tens  of  thousands  of  people   watching  these  live  streams,  we'll  look   back  on  this  and  and  and  we'll  be   nostalgic  for  it  in  a  way  that  we're   kind  of  nostalgic  for  Gary  Gendler  now,   I  think.   >> Wow,  guy.  I  mean,  if  this  crypto  thing   never  works  out  for  you,  then  you  can   always  go  into  motivational  speaking   because  I  feel  so  inspired  by  that.   You  could  always  Yeah,  you  could  always   become  a  professional  artist.   There's  there's  a  career  view  in  that.   Okay,  folks.  Well,  there  you  are.  We  we   we  uh  we  highlighted  the  negatives,  but   we  also  highlighted  some  positives  as   well.  And  I  think  I  had  a  good  time   doing  it.  It  was  lots  of  fun.  So,  uh   thank  you  for  watching.  Stay  tuned.  Lots   more  videos  coming  your  way.  We  will  be   back  with  you  uh  same  time,  same  place   next  week.   >> Cheers,  guys.  See you  then.   >> See  you  soon.   >> I'm  just  here  for  the  rodent.  Partially   digested  coffee  beans.  Great  video.   You  guys  are  awesome.   Where  in  the  world  are  you  watching   from?  Mariana  Stranch,   Minnesota.   Watching  from   the  land  down  under.
