    "transcript": "Bitcoin  hard  from  the  peak.  I  mean,  that   is  going  to  take  a  lot  of  people  out  and   surprise  a  lot  of  people  and  upset  a  lot   of  people.  Most  people  who  were  going  to   who  were  going  to  be  kicked  out  of  the   market  have  been  done  so  and  it's  just  a   matter  of  like  shaking  out  the  last  few   people.  And   >> I  heard  people  say  back  last  year  that   they  wished  Bitcoin  could  drop  so  they   could  buy  it  cheaper.  Uh  they  were   talking  about  dollar  cost  averaging.  Now   the  sentiment  is  very  negative  and   pessimistic.   >> I  mean  I  I  love  that  sentiment  being  at   that  um  you  know  extreme.  I  want  to  ask   about  Micro  Strategy   >> and  I  suppose  if  you're  looking  for  a   sweet  entry  point,  the  day  that  Micro   Strategy  says,  \"Oh,  we've  had  to  sell   some,\"  would  be  the  time  to  get  in.   >> Do  you  think  that  again,  if  not  this   year,  maybe  next  year,  2027,  we  might   see  eventually  Bitcoin  rallying  to  new   all-time  highs.  All right,  guys.  Hello   and  welcome.  We're  honored  today  to  have   my  good  friend  and  trader,  Zach  Mir,   with  us.  We're  going  to  talk  about   Bitcoin  and  specifically  Bitcoin  charts,   Bitcoin  sentiment,  and  what  Zach's  view   is  on  Bitcoin  overall.  By  the  way  guys,   before  we  continue,  let  me  just  say  that   Zach  Mir,  in  my  view,  is  one  of the  best   technical  analysts  out  there.  He's  one   of  the  pioneers  of  technical  analysis.   Zack  was  using  charts  before  everybody   started  using  charts  uh  back  in  the  uh  I   think  it  was  the  '9s.  So  guys,  please  do   follow  him  on  X,  his  X  account  and   handle  is  Zack's  Traders  Cafe.  Before  we   start  though,  and  before  I  get  Zach  in   here,  uh  I  do  actually  want  to  ask   everyone  here  a  question,  which  is  that   imagine  for  a  second  that  your  favorite   car  manufacturer.  Now,  for  me,  that's   Mercedes  because  I  love  German  cars  in   general,  but  it  could  be  different  for   you,  of  course.  But  imagine  your   favorite  car  manufacturer,  imagine  they   said  they  had  a  50%  sale  or  discount  on   all  their  cars.  I  don't  know  about  you,   but  I  don't  think  that's  a  bad  thing.  I   actually  would  think  that  would  be  a   wonderful  thing  if  Mercedes  said,  \"Hey,   we're  going to  have  a  50%  sale  or   discount.\"  But  it  does  seem  right  now  I   mean  coming  back  to  Bitcoin  today  when   you  consider  that  many  people  consider   Bitcoin  to  be  the  Mercedes  of  the  crypto   world  you  know  the  highest  quality   crypto  there  is  it  does  seem  quite   interesting  that  many  people  despite  the   50%  drop  that  has  occurred  from  the   all-time  high  of  Bitcoin  you  can  think   about  as  a  50%  discount  for  example  many   people  are  absolutely  scared  and  afraid   and  pessimistic  and  negative  on  Bitcoin   especially  as  we  can  see  on  the   sentiment  readings  uh  the  fear  and  greed   index  shows  that  that  the  sentiment  has   been  extremely  fearful  uh  very  negative   uh  towards  Bitcoin.  Even  the  social   media  comments  are  very  negative  and   pessimistic  and  looking  scared  on   Bitcoin.  And  this  actually  makes  me   think  of  something  that  the  analyst  Tom   Crossill  said  on  his  channel  and  I'll   put  a  clip  there  uh  of  what  Tom  Crossell   says.  The  market  was  down  50%  at  that   point,  but  everywhere  around  me  I  saw   terrified  people.  Even  professionals   were  scared.  Not  that  many  people  were   excited  about  buying  stocks  in  early   2009.  This  always  happens.  Investors   pile  into  the  market  when  the  market  is   doing  great  and  everything  is   profitable.  And  they  don't  invest  when   the  market  is  down  and  the  news  are   scary.  Although  those  are  often  the  best   times  because  you're  buying  stocks   cheap.  And  I  actually  agree  with  him.   And  by  the  way  guys,  before  I  continue,   let  me  also  mention  this  video  is  purely   for  educational  purposes.  It's  by  no   means  a  recommendation  to  buy  or  sell   Bitcoin  or  any  crypto.  Okay,  let's  go   back  now  to  Zack.  Zack,  let  me  just  take   off  my  glasses.  First  of  all,  what  do   you  think  about  the  sentiment  we're   seeing  right  now  across  the  board  in  the   Bitcoin  community?   >> On  the  basis  of  the  sentiment  sentiment   alone,  I  would  say  that  uh  you'd  be   looking  uh  that  um  we're  very  near  the   bottom  of  the  latest  move.  Obviously,  we   we  we  fell  back  uh  some  50%  from  the   peak.  So,  if  you've  got  any  belief  in   Bitcoin,  probably  now  would  be  the,  you   know,  the  60  near  60,000  or  whatever  it   is  is  a  a  level  of  interest.  Let's  put   it  that  way.  Uh  despite  everything  I've   just  said,  I  want  to  make  it  very  clear   that  I'm  not  saying  Bitcoin  has  bottomed   uh  necessarily  uh  because  it  might   potentially  see  a  lower  low.  I  think   Zach  and  I  were  discussing  this  earlier   that  we  might  see  it's  it's  absolutely   possible  for  us  to  see  a  lower  low,   another  leg  lower  on  Bitcoin.  That's   absolutely  possible  despite  any   short-term  bounces.  So,  there  might  be  a   short-term  bounce  on  Bitcoin.  Uh  but   another  leg  lower  or  potentially  lower   levels  below  60k  are  possible  and  even   probable.  Uh  but  I  think  what  you're   saying,  Zach,  you  believe  that  we're   potentially  reaching  capitulation  zones   uh  even  if  Bitcoin  continues  to  go   lower.   >> I'm  sure  people,  you  know,  the  Bitcoin   hard  from  the  peak.  I  mean,  that  is   going  to  take  a  lot  of  people  out  and   surprise  a  lot  of  people  and  upset  a  lot   of  people.  the  current  situation  is   whether  67,000  or  57,000  is  the  is  a   potential  low  area  or  65,000  as  we  had   recently  but  at  the  moment  just  on  the   basis  of  sentiment  alone  I  would  say   that  we  are  uh  in  a  an  area  of  interest   most  people  who  were  going  to  who  going   to  be  kicked  out  of  the  market  have  been   done  so  and  it's  just  a  matter  of  like   shaking  out  the  last  few  people  and  the   market's  sort  of  sniffing  around  for   stop  losses  and  maybe  any  buyers  and   this  and  that  you  can  sort  of  seeing  it   doing  it  sort  of  uh  mine   mining  technique  or  whatever  it  does   with  these  things.  So,  sniffing  out  the   I  don't  think  I  think  it'd  be  difficult   to  go  short  here  and  even  if  you  did  go   short,  you'll  probably  be  thinking,  \"Oh,   well,  it'll  be  a  quick  trade.\"  You're   not  going  to  be  thinking,  you  know,  it's   going to  be  an  extended  move.  So,  uh  so   that's  the  thing  there.  The  other  the   other  fundamental  factor  which  um  u  is   being  mentioned  is  is  the  rise  of   quantum  computing  and  whether  that  will   be  a  factor  in  making  uh  it  go  through   the  roof  again  because  um  stronger   computers  can  mine  more  bitcoin  so   there's  more  demand  blah  blah  blah  or   whether  there  will  be  an  adjustment  made   by  um  Satoshi  or  whoever  he  is  behind   the  scenes  there'll  be  a  tweak  so  that   uh  until  the  next  h  havinging  which  is  I   don't  know  in  a  couple  of  years  time.   We're  in  a  sort  of  we're  in  that  kind  of   nuclear  winter  that  we  were  after  2021,   you  know,  that  kind  of  that  kind  of   decline.  So,  the  pandemic  bubble  there.   I  think  I  I  I  don't  want  to  believe  that   we're  going  to  have  an  extended  um   pullback.  I  think  that  that  the the   buying  in  the  summer  going  and  then   which  sort  of  failed  in  the  autumn  was   something  which  will  does  mean  that   bitcoin  can  become  a  a  proper  treasury  a   proper  store  of  value  but  it  was  just  it   got  it  got  over  it  got  overcooked  so  I   think  when  Trump  came  in  the  bitcoin  was   around  72,000  we've  now  lost  all  that   and  a  bit  more  but  probably  60  to  70,000   if  he  hadn't  opened  his  mouth  or  all   that  sort  of  stuff  would  be  would  be  a   kind  of  fair  thing.  Now,  so  I  think   that's  my  kind  of  view  that  whether  it's   67  or  57,  I'm  not  expecting  a  nuclear   winter.  I  don't  really  want  I  mean  I  I'm   very  sentimental  towards  Bitcoin  even   though  not  in  it  at  the  moment.  But  I'm   just  saying  that  I  I  do  I  do  like  its   it's  the  technology  if  only  as  a  um  you   know  a  store  of  value  in  places  where   you  you  know  you  can't  carry  money   around  and  you  know  in  Africa  or  Asia   you  know  places  like  that  developing   economies  you  know  trading  in  Bitcoin   and  just  using  it  as  a  you  know  like  we   use  uh  fiat  currency  is  is  is  a   potential  thing  for  people.  So  I'd  like   it  to  win.  I  mean  uh  I'll  come  back  to   this  point  that  Zach  just  made  back  in   November  of  last  year.  I  mentioned  in  my   videos  for  example  even  the  member   videos  I  mentioned  that  there  was  a  Dow   theory  bearish  signal  which  introduces   downside  risk  because  of  the  Dow  theory   bearish  signal.  At  the  moment  there  is   an  increasing  or  elevated  risk  of  more   downside  potential.  Recently  my  good   friend  and  trader  Manuel  Bllye  the  Dow   theory.com  he  mentioned  in  his   newsletter  that  Bitcoin  had  triggered  a   Dow  theory  bearish  signal   >> and  also  there  was  another  important   warning  sign  which  I  mentioned  back  in   January   >> that  recent  price  drop  on  the  price  of   Bitcoin  seems  to  indicate  that  Bitcoin   is  now  getting  rejected  from  the  21   weekly  moving  average.  So  guys  as  it   stands  right  now  as  I'm  making  this   video  it's  not  good  news  for  Bitcoin  at   the  moment.  The  odds  have  increased   towards  the  bearish  side.  For  now,   sellers  or  bears  have  control.  At  the   moment,  the  probabilities  are  increasing   that  Bitcoin  could  potentially  now  move   to  new  lows  and  potentially  below  the   80k  level  and  to  the  70s.  But  Zach,   isn't  it  interesting  how  last  year  when   Bitcoin  was  above  100,000,  maybe  close   to  120,000  last  year,  you  know,  there   were  so  many  people  saying  that  Bitcoin   could  not  possibly  drop  because  of   fundamentals.  I  heard  people  say  back   last  year  that  they  wished  Bitcoin  could   drop  so  they  could  buy  it  cheaper.  Uh   they  were  talking  about  dollar  cost   averaging  when  Bitcoin  drops  is  such  a   good  thing.  That's  what  they  were  saying   last  year.  Now  the  Bitcoin  has  dropped   by  50%  and  it  may  continue  to  go  lower.   Uh  the  fact  is  that  people  right  now   have  completely  reversed  course.  Now   they're  saying  no  no  Bitcoin  is   horrible.  They're  saying  no  it's  a  bare   market  that  it's  to  be  avoided.  It's   it's  dangerous.  You  know  they're  saying   and  certainly  don't  get  me  wrong  here   there  is  risk.  there  is  a  risk  that   Bitcoin  could  potentially  continue  to  go   lower.  I'm  not  saying  there  aren't  any   risks,  but  what  I  am  saying  is  this,  how   the  sentiment,  the  psychology  of  people   who  were  so  greedy  and  bullish  about   Bitcoin  last  year,  saying  that  uh  they   wished  Bitcoin  could  become  cheaper  and   so  they  could  dollar  cost  average.  Now   they  completely  forgotten  all  about   that.  Now  the  sentiment  is  very  negative   and  pessimistic.  I  mean  I  I  love  that   sentiment  being  at  that  um  you  know   extreme  because  it  reminds  me  of  when   the  VIX  goes  through  50  wise  heads  have   been  say  you  know  VIX  at  50  plus  uh   that's  when  you  buy  stocks   >> um  you  know  there  it's  a  perfect  fear  uh   gauge  and  fear  and  greed  gauge  and  um   you  know  probably  below  20  or  whatever   it  is  on  that  and  so  I  think  if  this  is   analogist  to  that  it's  you  know  we  are   >> may  not  be  at  the  bottom  and  and  you   know,  if  you're  a  long-term  Bitcoin  fan,   then  under  last  year's  low  under  the   Trump  where  he  came  in  and  at  this  sort   of  kind  of  level,  well,  you  know,  it's   is  one  of  those  things.  But  obviously,   it  wasn't  it  wasn't  a  store  of  value  uh   clearly  wasn't  a  store  of  value  at   90,000,  100,000,  whatever  it  is.  But  I   don't  think  you  could  have,  you  know,   that  the  the  hype  was  so  good  and  you   had  people  you  had  corporate   institutional  buying  of  Bitcoin  and   Bitcoin  treasury  strategies.  There's   like  20  or  30  companies  here  in  the  UK   which  adopted  that  and  they're  still   doing  it.  Smarter  web  is  still  doing  it.   You  know,  Smarter  Web  is  a  company  that   raised  £250  million  to  just  buy  Bitcoin   and  it's  been  doing  it  all  the  way  down.   >> By  the  way,  guys,  before  we  continue,  if   you  have  not  yet  signed  up  for  the   special  offer  to  become  a  member,  go   ahead  and  check  it  out.  The  link  is  in   the  description.  And  guys,  as  a  member,   you  can  check  out  and  watch  my  member   videos  which  contain  much  more  detailed   analysis  and  often  with  Elliot  waves  on   the  charts  of  stock  markets,  gold,  and   Bitcoin.  I  want  to  ask  about  Micro   Strategy  uh  because  there  are  some   speculations  out  there.  I've  heard  this   that  if  Bitcoin  were  to  drop  to  near  50K   if  that  happens  that  Micro  Strategy   could  be  forced  to  sell  its  uh  Bitcoin,   I've  heard  this  uh  rumor  um  out  there.   Uh  so  I  want  to  ask  you  about  that.  But   uh  before  before  I  get  into  that,  just   going  back  to  to  the  chart  of  Bitcoin  in   general,  uh  we're  coming  down  to  some   important  support  levels.  uh  for   example,  but  I  want  to  ask  you  whether   you  think  that  Bitcoin  has  still  got   more  downside  to  go  below  60K  and  do  you   think  that  Bitcoin  could  potentially   drop  to  50K?  I  think  that  it  is   interesting  that  you've  got  the  dynamic   between  what  the  tentacles  look  like   which  is  like  okay  we're  five  or  10,000   away  from  the  floor  and  we'll  we'll   settle  somewhere  in  the  50s  anyway  let's   say  and  then  we  can  we  can  rebound  and   then  what  you're  talking  about  the  you   know  the  micro  strategy  factor  there's   there's  also  a  company  here  called   smarter  web  which  as  I  said  raised  150   million  whether  there  will  be  forced   liquidations  by  those  companies  or  a  lot   or  a  lot  of  people  who  bought  you  know   80  90  100,000  just  saying  well  actually   we're  down  50%  now  better  get  you  might   know  we  can't  we  can't  raise  any  more   money  for  this  strategy  we'll  get  out   and  I  suppose  if  you're  looking  for  a   sweet  entry  point  the  day  that  Micro   Strategy  says  oh  we've  had  to  sell  some   would  be  the  time  to  get  in   >> so  that  so  that  would  be  the  so  if   you're  if  you're  not  in  it  now  at  all   and  you've  never  been  in  it  probably  the   day  uh  or  the  week  after  you  hear  that   um  that's  happened  is  the  time  to  get   in.  It's  it's  the  uh   >> it's  almost  counterintuitive,  isn't  it?   So  it's  almost  like  severe  bad  news  hits   the  market.   >> Yeah.  Know  it's  just  when  it's  just  like   in  the  real  estate  market  once  people   start  defaulting  on  uh  their  houses,   that's  the  time  to  buy,  right?  So  it's   like,  you  know,  stop  losses,  margin   calls,  all  that  sort  of  stuff.  Um  that   those  are  all  the  signals  to  to  get   involved,  right?   >> Uh  but  yeah,  I  mean  that's  a  very   interesting  point,  Zach,  that  you  made   that  some  sometimes  when  extreme  bad   news  hits  the  market.  Uh,  as  a  matter  of   fact,  if  you  recall,  Zach,  I'm  sure   people  remember  this.  In  2022,  what  was   the  major  bad  news  of  that  year?  FTX,   right?  When  FTX  imploded,  that  was   everyone  thought,  man,  that's  it.  It's   over  for  Bitcoin.  As  a  matter  of  fact,   the  the  time  when  FTX  essentially   collapsed,  November  of  2022,  which  was   right  before  the  bottom  that  occurred  in   Bitcoin.  So  despite  one  of  the  most   severely  bad  newses  that  occurred  that   year  in  2022  by  the  FTX,  it  came  soon   before  a  major  bottoming  formation  on   Bitcoin.   >> It's  one  of  those  things  that  they   announce  or  somebody  announces  that  oh   we've  had  to  liquidate  or  goes  somebody   goes  bust  there's  a  there's  a  knee-jerk   decline  and  then  you  say  okay  that's   that's  the  news  I  was  waiting  for.  But  I   think  we  are  very  much  in  that   >> like  looking  around  trying  to  you  know   at  this  level  in  this  time  you're  almost   expect  I'm  almost  expecting  now  that   there'll  be  some  kind  of  news  like  that   some  you  know  some  firm  here  has  gone   bast  or  some  firm  here  is  doing  this  or   that.  So  uh  very  interesting  on  that  but   that's  those  are  the  gift  those  are  the   gift  moments  in  the  market.   >> True.  True.  Okay  let's  continue  now.   What  about  the  long-term  outlook  for   Bitcoin  Zack?  I  mean,  many  people  I've   heard  uh  on  social  media  are  saying  now   I've  heard  people  say  that  Bitcoin   potentially  is  doomed  until  October  of   this  year.  They're  expecting  this  uh   bare  market  to  continue  uh  until  October   this  year.  I've  heard  people  mention  50K   and  even  25K  or  20K  for  Bitcoin   reflecting  the  negative  sentiment   towards  Bitcoin.  I  guess  the  question  is   this.  Do  you  think  that  it's  highly   unlikely  for  Bitcoin  to  reach  new   all-time  highs  this  year?  Also,  do  you   think  some  kind  of  a  major  rally  or   bounce  could  happen?  I  personally  think   a  rally  or  a  bounce  could  could  actually   occur  in  the  next  several  months  likely   in  the  spring  or  the  summer  period.  So,   I  think  a  major  bounce  or  a  rally  could   occur  in  the  next  several  months.  One   thing  I  should  mention  here,  people   often  misunderstand  when  I  use  the  word   bottom  because  when  I  use  the  word  when   I  used  the  word  bottom  in  my  last  video,   people  assume  that  I  meant  a  bottom  or  a   rally  to  new  all-time  highs.  No,  all  I   meant  was  we  could  have  a  an   intermediate  bottom.  The  word  bottom   does  not  necessarily  mean  that  we're  off   on  our  way  on  our  way  to  new  alltime   highs.  It  doesn't  mean  that.  But  I   wonder,  Zach,  what  do  you  think?  Do  you   think  that  again,  if  not  this  year,   maybe  next  year,  2027,  we  might  see   eventually  Bitcoin  rallying  to  new   all-time  highs  above  126K.  I  think  for   this  year  the  way  it  looks  and  the  way   you  know  the  way  the  the  volatility's   gone  down  everything  else  the  way  it   looks  to  me  is  this  is  going  to  be  a   boring  year.  So  50  to  80  or  60  to  90  or   whatever  is  going  but  this  is  going  to   be  you  know  last  year's  think  whatever   happens  I  can't  see  last  year's  peak   being  taken  out  quickly  doesn't  mean   that  but  I  just  think  you  know  say  it's   50  to  100  or  whatever  it  is  or  50  to  80   think  that  would  be  a  fair  year  for  this   year  given  how  bad  sentiment  is  and  it   needs  drivers  on  the  upside  and  we're   still  l  we're  still  holding  our  breath   for  potential  negative   uh  drivers  on  the  downside.  So  I'm   optimistic  because  I  love  you  know  I   love  Bitcoin  and  I  think  that  there  may   be  it  might  be  that  you  know  somebody   announces  something  with  quantum   computing  and  says  that  we're  able  to   mine  100  times  more  than  anybody  else   and  the  market  goes  berserk  because  of   that  because  I  think  on  on  a  technology   on  the  technology  side  and  there  you   know  there  are  a  few  stocks  obviously   riding  the  wave  with  the  quantum   computing  there  there  are  drivers  on  the   upside  as  well.  So  that's  why  I'm  kind   of  like   probably  a  possib  a  problem  in  uh   companies  investing  in  Bitcoin  or  even   the  Bitcoin  um  trading  platforms  or  the   crypto  trading  platforms  measured   weighed  against  uh  you  know  some   positive  stuff  coming  on  mining  and  and   the  cost  of  mining  and  the  the   processing  power  of  mining.   >> There  may  still  be  more  downside  risk  in   the  next  few  weeks  uh  or  month  or  so.   But  I  think  uh  am  I  correct  in  saying   that  you  you  believe  that  2027  perhaps   next  year  may  be  a  potential  where   Bitcoin  could  be  able  to  rally  back  to   its  all-time  highs?  Uh  or  do  you  have  a   different  view?  Sorry.   >> Yeah.  No,  I  think  you  know  126  is  is  you   know  nothing  for  is  nothing  for  Bitcoin.   I  mean  you  know  it  moved  very  well  up  to   that  level.  Um  I  think  probably  maybe  we   should  be  asking  ourselves  why  did  it   fall?  Why  is  it  hard  from  the  peak?   What's  the  reason?  Too  many  people  long   was  it,  you  know,  the  sentiment  went   mad.  Bitcoin  treasury  strategy  companies   and  the  political,  you  know,  the  the   sort  of  the  the the  the  administration   apparently  being  pro  crypto  were  the   where  are  the  two  drivers?  Those  been,   you  know,  in  the  last  year  or  so,  those   have  been  the  two  drivers.  And  if  the,   you  know,  if  there's  governmental  um   support  or  um  more  adoption,  etc.,  etc.,   then  you  know  maybe  we  can  flip  back   very  quickly.   >> It's  interesting  point.  Uh  thanks  Zach.   So  thanks  very  much  indeed  Zach.  I   really  appreciate  it.  Guys  do  go  ahead   and  check  out  Zack  on  X.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin jelenlegi piaci helyzete 50%-os visszaesést mutat a csúcsról, ami sok befektetőt megijesztett és pesszimista érzéseket keltett. A közösségi média negatív hangulatú megnyilvánulásai és a félelem-gazdagság index alacsony értékei erre utalnak. Zack Mir, a videó vendége, a technikai elemzésre támaszkodva megjegyzi, hogy a jelenlegi piaci helyzet, minden félelme ellenére, közel lehet a mélyponthoz, de a Bitcoin árfolyamának további csökkenése is lehetséges. A sentiment elemzések és a piaci viselkedés alapján lehetséges, hogy a jövőben új ajánlati szint alakulhat ki, különösen, ha a MicroStrategy eladási kényszere bekövetkezik. A befektetők sokasága most elfordult a Bitcoin vásárlásától, miközben a múltban emelték az árfolyamot, a piaci pszichológia változása pedig érdekes, hiszen ez korábbi bullish hangulatot követhet. Az elemzők javasolják, hogy a potenciális csúcspontok megvásárlása szempontjából érdemes figyelni a piac mozgásait, főleg negatív hírek után.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin's current market situation shows a 50% drop from its peak, alarming many investors and creating a pessimistic sentiment. Negative reactions on social media and low fear-greed index scores highlight this trend. Guest Zack Mir notes that despite the fear, the market could be near a bottom, although further declines are possible. Analyzing sentiment and market behavior suggests that new support levels may form in the future, especially if MicroStrategy faces a selling pressure. The shift in investor psychology is striking, as many have turned away from buying Bitcoin, contrasting with past bullish sentiments. Analysts advise watching market movements closely for strategic buying opportunities, particularly following bad news.",
