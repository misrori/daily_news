    "transcript": "Yes,  yes,  yes.  Guys,  welcome  to  another   episode.  And  as  you can  see  right  now,   Bitcoin  is  sliding  lower.  All  coins  are   sliding  lower.  And  this  is  something   we've  been  expecting  for  quite  some  time   now.  The  fact  that  this  consolidation   right  here  that  we've  had  from  the  uh   November,  February,  from  the  February   dump,  it's  just  consolidation  before   we're  slicing  down  more.  That's  what   we've  been  saying.  Why?  Because  we  had   this  massive  massive  dump  at  the   beginning  of  February.  We  did  not  get  a   V-shaped  recovery  or  any  kind  of  big   bounce  that  would  cancel  this  red   candle.  And  now  we're  slowly  slowly,   step  by  step  by  step,  week  by  week  by   week,  stepping  stepping  back  into  the   buy  zone  where  this  week  took  us.  Okay,   this  is  something  we've  been  expecting.   It's  inevitable.  And  the  question  is  how   fast  can  we  go  into  the  buy  zone  and   whether  we're  going  to  have  any  kind  of   meaningful  relief  rally  anytime  soon?   Because  if  you  look  at  the  yearly   performance  for  Bitcoin  in  a  midterm   year,  you  see  that  we  should  have  some   kind  of  bounce  in  the  coming  10  days  or   so.  Just  comparing  the  green  chart,   which  is  the  current  year,  to  the   previous  midterm  years,  for  example,  the   yellow,  which  is  2014,  or  the  orange.   You  see  here,  within  the  coming  10  days,   we  should  see  some  kind  of  uptick.   doesn't  really  have  to  repeat  exactly  as   last  year's.  But  normally  here  somewhere   we  do  see  a  bit  of  a  relief.  So  that   wouldn't  surprise  us  either.  But  overall   there's  just  too  much  pressure  too  much   pressure  on  Bitcoin.  What  would  make   sense  is  potentially  that  we  go  all  the   way  to  a  200  moving  average  then  get   some  kind  of  bounce  like  this  and  then   yeah  continue  derping  around  here  within   the  buy  zone.  But  within  the  buy  zone   guys  it  is  a  good  idea  to  start  nibbling   a  bit  to  start  buying  slowly  even  though   we  expect  further  downside.  Why?  because   you  never  know.  We  we  never  know  for   sure  what's  going  to  happen.  We  expect   further  downside  uh  throughout  the  year,   but  uh  bulls  could  step  in  earlier.  It   can  absolutely  happen.  So  that's  why  we   will  start  nibbling  already  here  within   the  buy  zone.  We  did  already  nibble  here   at  the  beginning  of  February  before  we   snapped  out  of  the  buy  zone.  But  here   within  the  buy  zone,  it  is  where  Bitcoin   is  likely  to  bottom  out  somewhere  this   year,  guys.  So  I  don't  want  to  be  only   doom  and  gloom.  I  don't  want  to  be  only   about  negativity  about  bear.  But  listen,   bear  is  not  necessarily  negativity.  I   mean,  it's  all  about  if  you're  prepared   for  it,  if  you  know  how  to  handle  the   bear,  if  you  know  how  to  profit  from  the   bear.  So  bear  is  also  positivity  if  you   know  how  to  do.  But  let's  say  your  only   bull,  your  only  bull,  maybe  you're   holding  the  altcoins  down  because  you   you  didn't  derisk  or  you  just  pray  for  a   recovery,  then  there  is  a  bit  of  light   at  the  end  of  the  tunnel.  Uh  it's   somewhere  here.  Later  this  year,  you're   going  to  have  a  bit  of  light  at  the  end   of  the  tunnel.  And  guys  also  looking  at   our  community  the  pulse  the  pulse  of  the   community  it  is  fantastic  now  that  we   have  another  flash  down  because  the   shorting  is  the  way  now  and  it  it  work  I   mean  it  really  really  works  if  you  know   how  to  short  again  it's  not  only   negative  it's  only  positive  so  we  have   banksy  rules  shorting  XRP  shorting  soul   we  have  mooncat  shorting  file  shorting   hype  hyperlid  we  have  yellow  shorting   Sana  we  have  Amsterdam  shorting  Sana   also  a  lot  of  Sana  shorts  a  lot  a  lot  of   Sana  shorts  And  Sana  as  you  know  is   sliding  lower  and  lower  towards  our   target  at  30.  Uh  many  people  are  shocked   when  I  say  that  but  yeah  the  target  is   still  the  target.  I  mean  it's  it's  still   there.  And  let  me  know  by  the  way  guys   if  you  like  this  video  we  did  on  Friday.   I  don't know  how  many  of  you  saw  it  but   I  did  this  video  where  basically  I  went   through  a  bunch  of  shorting   opportunities  in  real  time.  This  wasn't   a  stream.  It  was  just  a  pre-recorded   video.  I  see  YouTube  did  not  push  it  as   much.  But  you  should  know  that  sometimes   we  release  these  videos  where  it's  not  a   full  stream.  I  think  YouTube  really   sends  out  notifications  for  the  stream,   but  when  I  do  a  video,  it  sends  out   less.  So,  ensure  that  you  subscribe  and   you  push  the  bell  button  because  on   Tuesday,  we  did  publish  we  did  publish  a   lot  of  shorting  opportunities.  So,   definitely  uh  keep  this  keep  this  in   mind  that  we're  still  in  the  bare  trend   and  bare  trend  means  mainly  short  man.   It  is  what  it  is.  It  it  is  where  the   money  is  made.  You  don't  have  to  be   depressed.  You  don't  have  to,  you  know,   just  wait  for  things  to  come  back.  You   can  be  proactive.  you  can  be  part  of  the   part  of  the  market  in  whatever  direction   it  goes.  Looking  at  XRP,  XRP  is  likely   going  to  slide  towards  this  uh  50  is  50   or  200  200  week  moving  average  here  at   1.1.  So  yeah,  be  be  prepared  if  you  have   XRP.  The  pressure  is  massive.  The   pressure  is  still  massive,  massive,   massive,  massive  when  it  comes  to  uh  to   the  downside.  And  looking  at  the   scanner,  let  me  refresh  the  money   scanner.  Let's  see  how  things  look  like   there  on  the  weekly,  on  the  daily.  So,   looking  at  what  flipped  in  the  last   weeks,  if  we  look  at  the  bearishness,  uh   what  flipped  bearish,  you  have  river  um   down  88%.  Holy  crap.  In  and  it  flipped   bearish  on  the  money  scanner  in  the  last   four  weeks.  Yeah,  this  quantum   resistance  mumbo  jumbo  is  down  31%.   Since  a  week  ago,  man,  since  a  week  ago.   Since  just  since  a  week  ago.  Now  we're   only  looking  at  the  newly  flipped  ones.   Those  that  flipped  on  the  weekly  last   month.  So  this  is  not  all  coins  that  are   dumping.  It's  just  those  that  if  you  had   the  money  scanner  you  could  have  acted   on  in  just  in  the  last  month.  You  have   Punji  Puny  Puni  down  30%  almost  30%.   Very  very  nice.  Qu  Network  down  28%.   Alchemist  down.  Uh  Chile.  So  yeah,  Beam   a  lot  of  pressure  to  the  downside.  Let   me  remove  this  filter.  Let's  just  see   everything  that's  currently  down.  Holy   crap.  This  gas  memecoin,  yeah,  you   remember  it  is  down  99%.  99%.  Um,  and  in   general,  you  know,  in  this  industry,  we   have  so  much  fluff.  Like  we  we  have  so   much  garbage,  okay?  We  have  so  many  like   this  memes,  this  and  that  is  so  much   garbage  that  one  person  may  say,  but  you   know,  it's  just  so  bad,  you  know,  it's   fluff.  And  another  person  may  say,  let   me  short,  let  me  short  it.  Let  me  short   the  crap  out  of  it.  So  that's  why   currently  in  the  bear,  guys,  it  is  how   we  work,  guys.  Celestia,  holy  crap,  man.   90.  Wow.  Wow.  I  forgot  about  this   massive.  This  is  since  a  year  ago.  Wow.   Wow.  And  the  question  of  course,  where   is  the  best  to  short?

And  currently,  we're  shorting   as  you  know.  And  also  I  mean  the  the   current  market  is  that  it's  mainly  to   the  downside.

Looking  at   the  longs,  I  mean,  let's  see  if   something  flipped  long,  if  something   like  is  is  happening.  U  yeah,  I  mean,   there  are  a  few  things,  but  this  big   numbers  we  need  to  fix.  It's  a  bit  of  a   not  a  bug,  but  it's  just  it's  a  new   coin.  And  when  a  new  coin  is  created,   it's  just  like,  you  know,  massive  gain   from  zero.  There  are  still  a  few  coins   here  and  there  that  do  okay,  but  it's   few  guys.  It's  few  versus  the  overall  if   you  look  at  the  uh  total  77%  is  bearish,   23%  bullish.  So,  you're  not  really  Yeah,   the  the  market  is  not  um  is  not  working   in  your  favor.  And  these  big  numbers,  we   have  to  adjust  them  a  bit.  We're  going   to  speak  with  our  team  because  yeah,  in   most  cases  it  is  this  new  coin  that  like   goes  from  zero  and  then  it  has  like   infinite  gain.  U  so  there  are  definitely   a  few  opportunities  to  go  uh  to  go  bull   as  well.  Um  but  uh  yeah  you  you  you're   working  against  the  current  you  you  are   uh  you  have  basically  yeah  you  see  70   some%  bearish  23%  bullish.  So  this  is   the  current  state.  It's  not  going  to  be   the  current  state  forever  guys.  I  mean   the  bulls  are  going  to  come  back.  The   market  is  going  to  turn  bullish  sooner   or  later.  It's  inevitable.  I  don't  buy   into  the  doomerism.  Many  people  are   doomerish.  What  What  do  I  have  here?   What  do  I  have  here,  guys?  What  is  this?   What  is  this?  See,  we  do  live   television.  I  didn't  even  have  time  to   get  my  hair  done.  It's  It's  Monday   morning.  See?  Yeah.  And  you  guys  don't   even  comment.  My  What  is  this?  What  is   this?  Where  is  my  combo?  What  is  this?   See,  as  soon  as  I  wake  up,  guys,  I'm   here  live.  I  here  live.  Okay,   guys.  Welcome,  welcome,  welcome.  Let's   take  some  coffee.  Welcome  everyone.  Big   shout  out  to   uh  Dab  Dab  who  is  timestepping  us  today.   Fantastic.  Welcome.  New  opportunity,  new   Monday.  Let  me  know  how  you  are  doing   this  uh  this  time.  And  you  know,  many   people  have  left  crypto  also.  It's  I   want  to  give  you  a  big  shout  out  guys  if   you're  still  here.  Overall,  crypto  is   starting  to  become  quite  dead  in  terms   of  the  engagement,  in  terms  of  the   sentiment.  And  it's  good.  It's  very,   very  good  because  that's  where  bottoms   are.  Uh  I  have  no  doubt  that  bottom  is   going  to  be  within  the  coming  year.  How   can  you  have  no  doubt?  Listen,  it's  just   based  on  probabilities.  Based  on   probabilities,  it's  very  very  likely.   Very  very  likely  that  um  we're  going  to   have  a  nice  rebound  in  the  market  soon.   But  at  the  same  time,  it's  still  bare.   It's  still  bare.  We  just  look  at  the   current  trend.  We  don't  frontr  run  it.  I   mean,  you  cannot  if  you  take  your   sunglasses  to  a  snowstorm,  you  you   cannot  frontr  run  the  the  the  spring.   You  cannot  frontr  run  the  summer.  So   many  people  try  to  do  that.  They  really   try  to  make  this  happen  that  it's  going   to  be  bullish  but  we  we  just  wait  it   out.  It  is  going  down  now  likely  more   downside  likely  more  downside  but  we   keep  the  sun  in  our  memory.  It's  going   to  come  back  and  it's  going  to  be  great   and  likely  later  this  year.  So  we   discussed  Bitcoin,  we  discussed  XRP,  we   discussed  Sana.  Let's  check  ETH.  What's   happening  with  ETH?  In  our  private  Q&A   in  Bulmania,  someone  asked  me  the  other   day  uh  how  low  how  low  will  ETH  go?   what's  like  a  good  uh  entry  for  ETH  and   you  know  with  ETH  the  chart  is  actually   not  the  best  from  an  opportunity   perspective.  Why  is  that?  Because  it's   just  been  chopping  sideways  for  so  long.   I  mean  you  can  say  it's  been  chopping   sideways  since  2020.  So  ETH  is  really   just  you  know  a  chop  chop  chop  chop   chop.  I  would  rather  buy  Sana  at  30  guys   uh  than  ETH  at  1K  because  if  Sana  goes   to  30  like  the  it's  going  to  be   monumental  entry.  It's  going  to  be   monumental  entry.  if  it's  just  chopping.   It's  just  chopping.  So  if  you  want  you   could  buy  it  at  around  know  1.5  1.2  star   DCA  in  here  at  the  you  know  yellow  uh   area  but  as  you  can  see  it  has  been   chopping  so  much  and  the  buy  area  here   is  quite  big  and  I  mean  ETH  currently  at   least  is  not  really  an  asset  which  uh   which  is  leading  the  industry.  It's  it's   more  so  that  Solana  is  leading  the   industry  and  pushing  the  frontier  with   new  tech  attracting  many  many  new  users   and  so  on  so  forth.  So  yeah  from  this   perspective  it's  both  boring  as  a  chart   it's  not  that  interesting  as  a  tech  you   know  blizzing  edge  pushing  blizzing  age   vital  has  dumped  8.8k  8K  ETH  in   February.   Don't  forget  that.  Uh  so  from  this   perspective,  the  for  me  personally,  I   will  not  be  touching  ETH  until  it  goes   into  bull  trend.  It's  not  as  interesting   as  Sana  going  to  thirsty.  And  I  mean   maybe  if  ETH,  here's  what  would  be   interesting.  I  don't  think  this  is  going   to  happen.  I  think  this  is  very   unlikely,  but  let's  say  ETH  breaks  out   from  the  range  and  it  goes  to  like  300.   I  know  it  sounds  insane  and  it's  very   unlikely.  It's  very  unlikely,  but  you   know,  when  people  ask  me,  Ian,  but  what   would  make  you  buy  ETH?  like  really,  you   know,  go  out  of  your  way,  not  follow  the   mechanical  rules,  not  follow  the  bullan   version,  just  buy  it  because  it's  so   cheap  somewhere  here  at  like  370  or   something  because  that  would  be  the  last   support  from  the  2019  2018  cycle.  Can  it   happen?  I  mean,  listen,  you  never  know.   You  never  know.  I'm  prepared  anyway   here.  I  don't  expect  it  to  happen.  I   think  we  have  so  I  mean,  we  have  quite   an  insane  support  here  at  around  1K.   It's  a  big  buy  area  here  uh  that  many   people  going  to  be  stepping  in  around   1K.  I  think  it's  very  unlikely  that  we   break  it.  But  guys,  should  we  break  it?   Should  we  get  some  kind  of  black  swan  or   whatever  then  370  for  ETH?  Mama  mia,   it's  very  good.  But  uh  yeah,  it's   wishful  thinking.  It's  very  unlikely,   but  uh  not  zero,  not  0%.  Looking  at  BNB,   what's  happening?  BNB  going  to  go  back   into  the  200  week  moving  average  at   around  500.  So  this  is  the  the  shortterm   uh  the  short-term  trade  still  has  a  lot   of  support  here  at  around  550  but  yeah   overall  is  magnetized  magnetized  towards   the  200  week  at  around  500.  So  keep  that   in  mind.  Uh  looking  at  the  overall  news   uh  we  we  mentioned  as  Vitalik  is  dumping   dumping  dumping  ETH.  Uh  Bitine  is  buying   ETH.  So  as  you  know  Tom  Lee  he  just   wants  to  accumulate  as  much  ETH  as   possible.  He  doesn't  really  care  whether   you  get  wrecked  along  the  way.  He's  he's   you  know  calling  this  big  numbers  all   the  time.  Okay,  it's  been  very  very   wrong.  But  you  see,  he  is  hitting  his   KPI.  This  is  where  your  journey  and  your   uh  portfolio  and  your  incentive  is  not   aligned  with  his  incentive.  I  mean,  he   just  wants  the  biggest  ETH  treasury   ever.  They  can  stomach  draw  downs  that   you  may  not,  you  may  not  because  you   hope  that  ETH  is  going  to  go  to  alltime   high  by  Q1.  Man,  Q1  is  ending  soon.  Uh   or  by  January,  which  is  already  which   has  already  ended.  And  here  is  where  Tom   Lee  is,  he's  gonna  be  super  successful   no matter  what.  Like  even  if  Eve  goes   down,  he  just  accumulates  and   accumulates  and  accumulates.  And  um  it's   not  his  personal  money.  So  it's  not  like   he  cares  dayto  day.  It's  not  like  it's   not  like  with  you  guys.  If  you  have  your   portfolio  is  down  a  lot,  you  care  every   day.  It  hurts  you  every  day.  You  have   anxiety  every  day.  You  feel  bad  every   day.  For  Tommy,  it's  not  his  money.  He   gets  tens  of  millions  in  compensation   from  Bitine  direct  income  into  his  bank   account.  He  loves  that.  So  every  day,   every  month,  he's  growing  his  net  worth.   No matter  how  ETH  is  go  is  doing  inside   Bitman  like  that's  that's  man's   secondary  probably  tertiary  probably   like  you  know  on  the  10th  place  of  his   priority  the  personal  priority  Tom.   Okay.  So  this  is  the  big  dissonance.  I   want  to  ensure  everyone  understands.  I   think  you  guys  understand  it  because   we've  been  covering  Tom  Lee  a  lot.  And   so  in  the  bearish  times  the  incentives   are  are  simply  not  aligned.  And  as  you   can  see  he's  doing  great.  He  he  has  a   target  of  reaching  5%  ETH  ownership.  He   has  reached  that.  If  it  goes  down  to  a   thousand,  he  really  doesn't  care.  It's   not  his  money.  If  it  goes  up,  fantastic.   He  gets  all  of  the  benefit  of  of  having   this  treasury  and  having  organized  it.   So,  we're  in  a  very  different  positions.   I  mean,  we  who  trade  our  money  every  day   in  the  market,  this  is  not  the  same.   It's  not  the  same  position.  Now,  guys,   Trump  and  Melania,  holy  crap,  guys,  look   here.  Trump  and  Melania  memecoins  leave   retail  investors  with  $4.3  billion  loss.   Fantastic.  This  is  why  guys,  crypto  is   going  to  get  attacked  by  the  Democrats,   by  the  political  opponents  of  Trump  as   soon  as  they  get  a  chance.  as  soon  as   they  get  a  chance,  we're  going  to  be   under  siege  big  time  because  Trump   family  is  so  much  invested  in  crypto,   which  in  one  way,  of  course,  was  great   to  to  push  the  crypto  forward,  to  remove   all  of  the  SEC  attacks,  to  ensure  that   we  have  good  regulation  and  so  on  and  so   forth,  but  good  regulation  still  hasn't   happened.  Okay.  Uh  we  don't  have  good   regulation.  We  have  temporar   temporary  we  have  temporarily  suspended   the  attack  against  crypto  because  Trump   can  say  that  personally  but  as  soon  as   Trump  is  out  the  other  guys  come  in  and   because  there  is  no  actual  new   regulation  they  can  change  everything  to   exactly  how  it  was  before  the  clarity   act  which  everyone  is  hoping  for  is  not   great.  I  mean  it's  uh  the  way  they   changed  it  is  that  this  is  basically  a   regulation  for  banks.  So  banks  can  now   feel  comfortable  entering  crypto  and   they  can  keep  uh  your  interest  to   themselves.  Meaning  that  if  you  have  a   stable  coin  company,  they  cannot  offer   interest.  So  the  so-called  good   regulation  that  will  come  and  Clarisil   act  will  likely  pass  is  not  even  good   for  crypto,  it's  good  for  banks.  So  all   in  all,  the  outcome  here  for  the  US   regulation  is  a  bit  shaky.  Good  for   banks.  For  the  average  DeFi  dev,  uh  I'm   not  too  sure.  And  because  of  this  uh   Trump  and  Melania,  Memecoin  and  so  on  so   forth,  many  losses  in  retail,  there's  a   lot  of  ammunition  for  the  Democrats  to   go  heavily  heavily  heavily  after  crypto   uh  later  uh  when  they  get  uh  get  in   power.  And  there  there  are  mid  midterm   selections.  When  they  when  they  going  to   happen,  guys,  in  November,  October.  So,   it's  going to  be  later  this  year  that   they  potentially  have  already  more   ammunition  to  go  after  crypto.  So,  let's   see  what's  going  to  happen.  All  in  all,   long-term  shouldn't  affect  too  much,  but   it  removes  a  lot  of  this  positive   expectations  and  that  has  to  be  priced   in.  And  that's  partially  what  we've  been   pricing  in  during  the  last  months.  The   fact  that  we're  not  going  to  have  this   great  regulatory  environment  with   Bitcoin  reserve  that  was  sold  in  um  2024   uh  in  election  year.  So  that's  that.  Now   let's  speak  a  bit  about  the  stock  market   guys  because  we  have  to  speak  about  AI   overall.  For  example,  here  you  have  a   agent  sending  400  41k  in  tokens  after  a   decimal  error.  They  wanted  to  send  how   much?  They  wanted  to  send   uh  four  Solana  tokens,  but  they  send   400,000  or  something.  So,  it's  the   problem  with  AI.  But  the  reason  why   we're  speaking  about  AI  is  because  it's   highly  connected  to  the  stock  market.   There  are  a  lot  of  discussions  now  how   the  stocks  will  react  to  the  AI   revolution.  Will  the  company's  in  S&P   adapt  to  AI  or  will  they  be  replaced?   And  there  is  an  interesting  article   circulating  called  the  2028   global  intelligence  crisis.  So  it's  a   bit  of  a  scenario  not  a  prediction   according  to  the  author  how  things  may   develop  where  AI  eats  more  and  more  and   more  of  the  companies  more  and  more  and   more  of  the  GDP.  So  the  author  here   pretends  that  it  is  2028  and  he's  saying   the  unemployment  rate  printed  10.2%  this   morning,  a  0.3   upside  surprise.  The  market  sold  off  2%   on  the  number  bringing  the  cumulative   draw  down  in  the  S&P  to  38%  from  its   October  2026  highs.  So  he's  quite   bearish  on  the  stock  market.  this  guy   who  is  uh  who  is  drawing  this  scenario   and  if  you  read  it  it's  quite  a  long   article  but  if  you  read  it  basically   he's  saying  that  AI  has  replaced  a  lot   of  companies  a  lot  of  companies  and  the   multiples  have  shrunk  and  the  only   companies  that  have  survived  is   basically  Nvidia  and  a  few  others   everyone  else  who  is  every  other  company   who  is  doing  software  has  been  massively   massively  massively  sold  off  why  because   of  AI  vibe  coding  because  you  replace   many  of  them  and  most  importantly   because  of  negotiation  power  the  fact   that  if  you  use  a  SAS  currently  you  can   go  to  them  you  can  negotiate  and  you  can   say  listen  we  could  potentially  replace   part  of  you  at  least  with  AI  okay  so   that's  one  part  the  fact  that  you  have   vibe  coding  you  can  easily  do  tools  now   guys  if  you've  been  working  in  software   if  you've  been  using  any  SAS  you  know   that  this  argument  is  mainly  for  guys   you  cannot  vibe  code  a  alternative  to  a   uh  uh  corporate  SAS  uh  corporate  SAS   that  has  all  of  the  certifications  sock   2  this  and  that  like  you  cannot  vibe   code  and  also  if  you  vibe  code  something   you  are  responsible  for  running  it  and   it's  just  internal  resources  okay  so   this  vibe  code  argument  I  don't  really   agree  with  it  at  all  at  all  and  you  may   be  asking  Ivan  what  accolades  like  what   kind  of  track  record  do  you  have  well   I'm  glad  you  asked  because  number  one  I   am  a  computer  scientist  number  two  we   raised  uh  $50  million  dollars  in  2022   for  our  tech  startup  Morales,  my  friend   and  I.  So  we  have  been  actually  using  a   lot  of  enterprise  SAS  and  Morales  itself   is  a  bit  of  an  enterprise  SAS.  So  we  did   do  all  of  these  certifications  like  sou   and  so  on  and  I  can  tell  you  that  if  you   have  someone  doing  vibe  coding  and  you   create  your  own  internal  team  for  some   kind  of  tool  that  you  replace  because   you  don't  want  to  pay  subscription  in   many  cases  it's  not  worth  it.  So  that's   that's  the  first  part.  The  second  part   where  the  article  does  make  sense  is   that  a  lot  of  SAS  companies  have  very   dumb  pricing.  Very  dumb  pricing.   Extremely  dumb  pricing.  It's  based  on   seeds.  And  that's  where  I  think  they're   going  to  be  grilled  a  lot.  A  lot  a  lot  a   lot  because  yes,  you  cannot  replace   their  their  uh  uh  their  uptime  or  their   reliability.  But  the  thing  is  you  also   yourself  don't  need  that  many  employees.   I  mean  AI  does  cut  employees.  It  does  do   that.  Okay.  So,  internally  in  all   organizations,  we're  going  to  see  a  mass   mass  layoff  wave.  We're  already  seeing   that.  I  mean,  try  guessing  a  job  as  a   junior  developer.  It's  quite  hard,  man.   It's  very  hard.  It's  very  very  hard.  Try   guessing  job  as  junior  anything  in  white   color.  It's  quite  hard  like  so  juniors   are  already  being  grilled.  But  it's  just   going  to  get  propagated  more  and  more   and  more  because  the  only  thing  that's   really  needed  now  uh  with  a  lot  of  tasks   whether  it  is  coding  or  legal  is  that   someone  senior  just  double  checks.  Okay,   that's  where  the  world  is  is  getting  to   that  a  lot  of  this  you  know  middle  guys   or  junior  guys  they  can  easily  be   replaced  by  AI  but  of  course  you  cannot   rely  fully  on  AI.  I  mean  AI  makes   mistakes.  it's  going  to  take  years  and   years  and  years  for  it  to  not  make   mistakes  like  this,  you  know,  send  uh  to   a  wrong  amount  of  money.  So  you  always   need  someone  senior  to  double  check.  You   ask  client  if  you  buy  a  service  and  you   know  that  they  using  AI  you  you  would  uh   be  very  comfortable  in  case  you  knew   that  someone  double  check  the  AI  and  so   all  in  all  juniors  going  to  be  cut   senior  seniors  going  to  stay  middle  is   going  to  be  cut  more  and  more.  Why  is   this  important  in  terms  of  stock  market   and  revenues?  Because  the  seedbased   model  does  not  make  sense.  It  it  simply   doesn't  because  if  everyone  cuts  a  bunch   of  their  team  due  to  AI  use,  okay,  now   all  of  this  seedbased  SAS  has  less   revenue.  So  this  seedbased  pricing  will   have  to  change.  They  will  have  to  figure   it  figure  out  something.  Uh  and  if   you've  been  using  corporate  SAS,  you   know  how  much  the  the  price  scales  as   soon  as  you  add  a  few  people.  It  seems   cheap  in  the  beginning.  you  add  like   five  guys,  it  becomes  quite  expensive.   You  add  another  10  guys  to  your  team   seat  base  man  it  explode  suddenly  it's   hundreds  of  thousands  of  dollars  you're   paying.  So  from  that  perspective  I  do   agree  that  there  is  a  repricing  that   needs  to  happen  he heavily  and  that's   that's  why  there  is  a  bit  of  pressure   here  on  S&P.  It  cannot  really  go  above   the  new  alltime  high.  NASDAQ  itself  is   kind  of  in  bare  trend  although  it's   sideways.  So  that's  the  biggest   uncertainty.  will  they  be  able  to   transform  from  seedbased  to  something   else?  Now  there  are  some  companies  that   will  die  off.  um  you  have  a  lot  of  SAS   that  charge  a  lot  of  money  without  being   true  corporate  SAS  without  you  know   having  true  this  you  know  certification   reliability  this  and  that  all  of  the  SAS   which  is  kind  of  for  retail  I  think  it's   going to  be  tougher  and  tougher  man   whether  it  is  you  know  somewhere  in   between  retail  not  retail  where  you   don't  really  count  on  them  too  much   anyway  they're  going  to  be  squeezed   they're  going  to  be  destroyed  I  mean   some  examples  maybe  Zapier  I  don't  know   how  much  like  you're  going  to  need  the   API  connector  where  AIs  can  kind  of   connect  themselves  quite  good.  I  I  don't   know  how  much  you  need  that  or  at least   you  probably  need  some  of  that  but  do   you  does  have  to  be  so  expensive?  I   don't  know  there  are  a  lot  of  things   where  and  maybe  listen  maybe  Zapier  will   make  it  just  like  one  example  where  um   it's  not  it's  not  like  as  critical  as   Salesforce  okay  you  cannot  compare   Zapier  and  Salesforce  totally  different   world  or  you  know  Zapier  and  some   accounting  where  all  of  your  company   data  is  in  um  and  there  are  many   examples  of  that  where  the  there  is  kind   of  SAS  but  not  super  corporate  so  the   only  mode  you  have  as  SAS  is  basically   if  you  have  a  lot  of  certifications   you're  corporate   If  you  go  away  your  customers  they  have   big  problem  big  problem  big  big  uptime   problem  reliability  problem  and  they   cannot  do  internally  and  that's  why  when   we  are  looking  at  some  of  these   companies  that  have  come  down  a  lot   let's  say  Salesforce  I  I  think  this  is   this  is  going  to  blow  over  this  kind  of   loss  is  going  to  blow  at  the  same  time   you  know  that  we  need  to  look  at  the   chart  and  the  chart  is  ugly  as  hell  so  I   wouldn't  try  catching  the  falling  knife   here  but  as  As  soon  as  it  flips  bullish,   we  may  see  fantastic  recovery.  Okay,   it's  still  falling  n  guys.  This  thing   there's  a  lot  of  uh  there's  a  lot  a  lot   of  fear,  a  lot  of  fad.  People  think  it's   going  to  go  to  zero  because  now   everyone's  going  to  vibe  code  their  own   accounting.  It's  not  going  to  happen.   It's  not  going  to  happen.  Uh  so  as  soon   as  it  it  turns  bullish,  this  this  could   be  an  interesting  uh  interesting  setup.   Uh  looking  at  uh  into  it  is  kind  of  the   same.  Uh  this  chart  is  even  uglier.  Holy   crap.  uh  not  touching  it  currently  not   at  all  because  it  looks  very  very  ugly.   It  is  falling  knife  but  at  some  point  it   will  bottom  out  and  uh  it's  another   example  where  there's  a  lot  of  fear.  I   don't  think  the  fear  is  uh  really   justified.  Uh  will  they  have  to  adjust?   They  will.  They  will.  So   another  example  where  they  probably  is   going  to  adjust.  Adobe  Adobe  falling  a   lot.   The  same  thing  is  here.  Ugly  chart.   Insane  ugly  ugly  chart.  Don't  touch  it   now.  It's  a  falling  knife.  At  some  point   we  will  see.  Yeah,  some  bottoming  out,   some  kind  of  uh  recovery  here.  Um,  let's   look  at  Nvidia.  How  Nvidia  look  Nvidia   super  strong,  super  strong,  super  strong   bull  trend  like  a  machine.  Let's  look   Apple.  What's  happening?   Super  strong  also.  Uh,  new  bull  trend.   This  bare  trend  ended  very  quick   quickly.  Amazon   a  bit  weaker  here.  A  bit  weaker.  Yeah,   let's  see  what's  going  to  happen.  Amazon   could  get  the  magnetized  towards  the  200   week.  So,  yeah,  be  prepared  for  that.   Google  super  strong,  very  very  strong.   And  here's  another  example  where  people   said  that  Google  is  going  to  get   replaced  by  AI.  It  was  a  lot  of  fear  uh   back  here  in  2022.  A  lot  of  fear,  a  bit   of  fear  here  as  well.  Uh  Google  has   regained  their  AI  lead  with  Gemini.  It's   one  of  the  best  and  obviously  integrated   everywhere.  Palanteer   uh  down  a  lot  uh  below  the  50WE,  but  to   be  fair,  it  has  pumped  a  lot  also.  It   can  easily  come  back  to  the  200  week   guys.  Palantra  200  week  is  going  to  be   insane  value.  Insane  value.  Can  it  come   back  there?  It  can  easily  come  back   there.  Why?  Because  it's  basically  the   same  price  as  you  know  late  2024.   This  distance  between  the  price  and  the   200  moving  average  is  just  you  know  a   measurement  how  much  how  quickly  it   pumped.  Okay.  And  normally  things  do   return  to  their  moving  averages.  So   yeah,  let's  see  when  it's  going  to   happen.  But  I  can  tell  you  that  the   government  will  not  vibe  code  and  a   Palencier  replacement.  Okay,  Maduro  got   extracted  probably  with  the  use  of   Palanteer.  I  don't  think  Trump  is  going   to  pull  up   Chad  GPC  and  VIP  code  the  replacement.  I   don't  think  it's  going  to  happen.   I  don't  think  it's  going  to  happen.   But  at  the  same  time,  it  pumped  so  much   it  does  make  sense  that  it  uh  that  it   gets  back  here  to  the  to  the  200  week.   So,  let's  see  what's  going  to  happen.   Meta,  meta,  meta  uh  chopping  sideways.   Uh  no  real  strong  trend  here.  U  meta   also  from  a  perspective  so  strong  man.   So  strong.  How  you  replace  in  how  will   AI  replace  Instagram?  In  fact,  AI  is   kind  of  helping  Instagram  because  a  lot   of  AI  videos  now  they  drive  engagement.   I  mean  people  watch  AI  videos  they  think   it's  real  or  they  know  it's  not  real   like  for  example  I  am  now  watching  it's   maybe  it's  a  bit  weird  but  I  get   financial  advice  from  AI  rabbis.   Okay,  they're  great.  They're  great.   They're  like,  \"Yeah,  Jewish  family  does   this,  does  this,  does  this.  That's  how   we  we're  smart  with  the  money,  man.  I   love  it.  I  follow  like  five  of  them.   They're  AI.\"  Did  you  guys  also  get  them?   They  have  They  have  exploded.  Like  for   financial  advice,  I  have  this  guys.  They   give  me  They  give  me  Oh,  wisdom.  They   give  me  wisdom  about  the  family,  about   Yeah.  about  money.  Money  is  great.  It's   great.  I  have  It's,  you  know,  very  good   content,  man.  Very  good  content.  and  is   AI.  So  just  you  know  coming  back  to  the   meta  stock  uh  why  is  it  uh  strong?   Number  one  it's  engagement.  AI  doesn't   gives  them  gives  them  engagement.  AI   will  not  replace  them.  You  cannot  vibe   code  your  own  Instagram.  Uh  well  you  can   no  one's  going  to  use  it.  Uh  strong   network  effect  massive  massive  revenue   for  for  advertisers.  Uh  I  mean  if  you   have  done  any  kind  of  internet  marketing   you  know  that  Facebook  is  uh  the  go-to   is  the  is  probably  the  best  I  don't  want   to  say  the  best  but  for  their  platform   they  have  insane  AI  ad  algorithm  insane   like  insane  with  Andromeda  upgrade  and   so  on  so  forth.  So  if  you're  selling   anything  online,  Facebook  is  the  go-to   place  and  people  in  the  past  were   saying,  \"Oh,  you  know,  Facebook's  so   bad.  It's  only  for  boomers.\"  Now,  you   know,  before  you  remember  guys,  in  2010,   u  everyone  was  using  Facebook  and  uh   like  I  was  using  Facebook.  But  then  it   got  taken  over  by  boomers  and  people   said,  \"Oh,  you  know,  it's  so  bad  now   your  grandma  is  there.  Before  you  were   there,  now  your  grand.\"  But  it's   actually  very  good  because  all  of  the   so-called  boomers,  they  have  more  money.   They  have  more  money.  So  now  they  have   Facebook,  which  is  a  cash  cow  for  them.   and  for  advertisers  because  think  about   yourself  like  you're  15  years  old.  How   much  money  are  you  gonna  spend  on  buying   stuff  that  you  see  in  ads?  So  anyway,   not  to  turn  into  like  a  a  stock  analysis   channel  here,  but  there  there  there  are   interesting  opportunities   and  I  love  discussing  the  impact  of  AI   overall  as  a  topic.  I  love  it.  I  love   it.  So  meta  I  don't  think  is  going  to  be   affected  too  much.  I  mean  that's  the   conclusion  at  least.  Apple  has  the   worst.  They  don't  have  AI.  Uh  they  have   hardware.  That's  why  they're  so  strong.   They  don't  have  the  AI  risks.  They  don't   care  about  AI  too  much.  They  just   integrate  AI  in  in  their  device.  Um,   yeah,  they  they  have  very  bad  AI   themselves.   But  it's  good  because  AI  it  takes  so   much  capital  to  develop.  So  a  lot  of  the   capital  that  goes  into  AI  is  also  a  big   risk  that  needs  to  be  priced  in.  What  if   it  doesn't  work?  They  invested   trillions.  Google  invests  trillions  and   trillions  and  trillions.  Like  what  if  it   doesn't  work?  What  if  it  doesn't  work?   Apple  didn't  have  that  risk.  They  are   like  lowrisk  company.  They  don't  they   don't  invest  too  much  in  this  AI.  They   they  tried  doing  on  their  own.  It  was   very  bad.  And  I  guess  they  didn't  want   to  put  more  money  into  it.  So  they  just   focus  on  the  hardware  re-releasing  the   same  iPhone  year  after  year  after  year.   No  update,  just  change  color,  people   buying  it.  Uh  great,  great,  fantastic   business  model.  You  no  risk  basically.  I   mean,  you  have  to  change  anything.  You   have  to  change  anything.  You  just,  you   know,  increment  number  iPhone  17,  iPhone   18.  Great.  Great.  Crazy.  But  that's  how   it  works.   Um,  oh,  another  one.  Service.  Now,  this   one  I  have  to  do  more  research,  guys.   Exactly  what  they  do.  They  do  some  kind   of,  you  know,  automation.  Like,  I  don't   know  what  hell  they  do  exactly.  I  need   to  do  a  bit  of  research.  But,  it's  one   of  these,  you  know,  bigger  stocks.  It's   one  of  their  the  biggest  softer  stocks   has  been  dumping  a  lot.  Um,  probably   once  it  uh  bottoms  out  uh  and  goes  into   bull  trend,  we'll  have  a  strong   recovery.  But  let  me  actually  see.  I   think  it  got  mentioned  here.  Um,   service.   Yeah.  Look  here.  Look  here.  Here.   Service.  This  guy  is  very  bearish  on   Service  Now.  Service  Now  sold  seats.   When  Fortune  500  clients  cut  50%  of   their  workforce,  they  canceled.  Yeah,   exactly.  So,  if  you  have  seats,  you're   in  you're  you're  in  trouble.  You're  in   trouble.  You're  in  trouble.  But  Service   Now,  maybe  you  guys  know  in  in  the  chat,   do  they  store  the  state  of  the  company?   Like,  is  it  a  statebased  SAS?  For   example,  with  Salesforce,  all  your  data   is  there.  So  it's  like  your  your  company   state  but  let's  see  what  the hell  did   cloud  computing  platform  for  creation   management  of  automated  business   workflow.  Okay.  Okay.  Yeah.  I  don't know   man.  Uh  maybe  it's  needed.  Let's  see.  So   that's  with  the  stocks.  That's  with  the   stocks.  Um   let's  see  what  else.  What  else  guys?   Let's  check  some  news  and  then  we  go  to   Q&A.  We  actually  already  checked  all   news  because  it  was  Vitalic.  It  was   Bitcoin.  It  was  Trump.  Let's  go  to  Q&A.   Questions,  answers,  debates,   discussions.  So,  let's  go  as  soon  as   possible.  Um,  number  one,  smash  up  the   like.  Number  two,  subscribe  to  the   channel.

What  exactly  is  the  money  line?  The   money  line  is  the  indicator  that  you  see   on  the  screen  right  now  that  tells  you   what's  bullish,  what's  bearish,  and  it   is  used  together  with  the  money  scanner.   The  money  scanner  you  see  right  here,  it   tells  you  which  assets  are  bullish  or   bearish  and  when  they  become  bullish  or   bearish  in  real  time.  Very  very   important.  Okay.  So  based  on  this,  you   have  an  overview  of  the  market.  You  get   real-time  alerts  when  something  goes   bare  or  bull.  Um,  for example,  you  see   here,  gold  is  still  bullish  after  one   year.  So,  one  year  ago  and  one  month   ago,  money  line  turned  bullish  on  gold.   You  could  have  gotten  a  realtime   notification  if  you  had  the  money   scanner.   And  yeah,  fantastic  bull  trend.  Uh,   Paladium  the  same.  Fantastic.  Um,  and   also  in  vice  versa.  Let's  see  how  the   bear  bear  trends  are  doing.  Cocoa,  you   you  like  your  cocoa  milk  chocolate  is   seven  month  seven  month  is  down  a  lot.   aluminum,  coffee,  sugar  and  so  forth.  So   this  is  commodities  obviously  crypto  the   same.  Crypto  the  same.  Bitcoin  three   months  ago  bare  big  loss.  Uh  ETH  three   months  ago  bare  big  loss.  XRP  3  months   ago  bare  big  loss.  BNB  3  months  ago  bare   big  loss.  Sana  3  months  ago  bare  big   loss  big  loss.  So  to  get  the  tools  to   get  our  education  to  get  everything  go   to  bull.com  and  watch  the  free  video.   That's  exactly  exactly  what  you  should   do  right  now.  Dogecoin  3  months  ago  bare   big  loss.  Oh  man,  Cardano  3  months  ago,   man.  It  was  just  three  months  ago.   Simple  3  months  ago  would  be  the   difference  between  portfolio  being  okay   and  portfolio  demolished  minus  57%.  Holy   crap.  And  it's  not  even  the  man  chain   link  four  months  ago  55%.   Stellar.  And  by  the  way  guys,  I'm   showing  you  here  the  coins  that  are  like   top  top  20  coins.  This  is  not  the  [ __ ]   coins.  This  is  you  know  chain  link  the   integrator  the  integrator  of  swift  and   blockchain  core  bluechip  protocol.   This  is  the  fundamental  trap  people  fall   into.  They  think  that  you  know  chain   link  is  going  to  work  with  swift.  Swift   is  going  to  pump  chain.  Guys  I  can  tell   you  swift  is  not  going  to  pump  chain   link.  Even  if  they  use  something  is   likely  going  to  pump  the  stock  of  the   company  that  does  chain  link  because   they  get  all  of  the  revenue  for   integrations.  For  example,  to  integrate   chain  link  on  a  new  chain,  I've  heard   it's  around  10  to  20  million,  guys.  To   add  a  chain  link  oracle  to  a  chain   around  10  to  20  million,  as  far  as  I   know,  correct  me  if  I'm  wrong,  but  that   money  doesn't  go  to  the  token.  It  goes   to  the  company  that  runs  chain  link.  So,   this  is  the  smartest  thing  to  be  like  a   blue  chip  coin  uh  founder  and  company   because  you  can  have  a  fantastic  news   for  your  company.  Let's  say,  you  know,   yeah,  chain  integration  or  Swift  is   going  to  do  something.  you  take  all  of   that  money  to  to  the  company  that  you   own  and  also  you  can  shield  it  to  your   bag  holders  and  they  love  it  also   because  they  think  that  it's  gonna  the   news  is  going  to  pump  their  coin.  It's   like  the  the  trifecta  so  to  speak.  The   the  you  get  both  of  it,  man.  You  get   revenue  yourself  and  the  bag  holders   love  it.  Great   guys.  Don't  fall  into  the  fundamental   trap.  I  mean  a  lot  of  these  coins  they   can  dump  so  much  and  it's  it's  only  been   four  months.  What  will  happen  in  eight   months?  It's  a  minier.  So,  and  the   reason  I'm  saying  telling  you  that  is   because  you  saw  the  Celestia  for   example.   Yeah.  Celestia   98%.  So,  this  is  this  is  a  year  and  10   months.  Chain  is  just  four  months.  This   is  after  one  year  and  10  months.  Okay.   So,  yeah,  it  is  what  it  is.  Uh,  by  the   way,  guys,  we  I'm  writing  a  book  on   this.  Did  I  tell  you?  Did  I  tell  you   guys?  I'm  writing  a  book.   How  have  I  told  you  guys?  Be  prepared   for  the  for  the  book.  It's  going  to  come   u  probably  soon.  Probably  soon.  Let's   see  when  I'm  I'm  still  finalizing  it.   I'm  now  up  in  uh  how  many  chapters?  Like   seven  chapters.  But  anyway,  you  can  you   can  it's  going  to  be  a  bit  of  my   background.  I'm  I'm  teasing  here  a  bit,   but  u  uh  so  I  don't  want  to  show  you  too   much,  but  there  is  a  section  on  traps.   Traps.  The  10  traps.  Okay.  10  traps.  10   traps,  guys.  This  book,  man,  is  going  to   it's  going  to  be  freaking  bestseller.   Crypto  bestseller.  So,  uh,  we  need  to   discuss  the  traps.  The  10  traps,  the   fundamentals  trap.  Okay,  the  macro  trap.   I'm  putting  it  all  in  writing.  All  of   the  lessons  from  this  cycle  that  we've   been  calling  it  so  great.  And  uh  uh  the   charlatan  trap.  Okay,  big  big.   The  diamond  hand  trap.   the   the   let's  see  the  next  trap.  The  revenge   like  I  have  all  of  the  traps,  guys.  I   have  all  the  traps.  I  have  all  of  the   traps.  I  have  them  documented.  I  have   them  documented  with  the  charts  with   everything  with  everything.  It's  going   to  be  fantastic.  It's  going  to  be   fantastic.  But  anyway,  so  here's  an   example  of  the  diamond  hand  or  the   fundamental  strap  in  front  of  us.  And   even  if  it  recovers,  let's  say,  you   know,  chain  link  recovers,  swift  does   pump  them.  Uh,  let's  see  what's  going  to   happen.  But,  uh,  the  thing  is  you  wanted   quick  profit  and  you  have  to  struggle   for  years  to  get,  you  know,  maybe  break   even.  Shea  70%,  Suie,  Suie,  R  Paul,  big   shout  out  to  R  Paul.  Suy  down  64%.  In   three  months,  man,  in  three  months,   since  the  bare  flip  and  this  is  since   the  bare  flip,  guys,  because  you  know   the  bare  flip  doesn't  happen  at  the   peak.  It's  not  our  goal  is  not  to  sell   at  the  top  very  top.  It's  impossible.   It's  impossible.  But  it's  around  the   top.  So  the  real  loss  from  the  peak  is   even  bigger.  But  it  I  mean  you  see  it   doesn't  matter  because  as  long  as  you   can  see  when  the  trend  is  changed  for   sure  you  act  on  the  new  trend.  It's  not   going  to  be  you  know  at  the  very  bottom   or  at  the  very  top.  But  we  we  don't  aim   for  that  because  it's  impossible.   Instead,  if  you  are  around  the  top  or   around  the  bottom  and  you  know  for  sure   that  the  trend  is  bullish  or  bearish,  in   this  case  bearish,  then  you  can  uh  take   the  bet  and  you  know  that  the  cards  are   stacked  in  your  favor.  So  you  guys  are   crazy.  Toncoin  tone,  what  happened  to   Toncoin,  guys?  One  year,  one  month  minus   73%.  Oh  my  god.  And  this  is  since  the   bare  flip.  Probably  since  the  top  is   maybe  80%.  Uh  Kronos.  Oh  yeah.  Yeah.   Cry.com.  What  happened?  What  happened   with  Cryp.com?  Pola  dot  since  one  year   and  two  months  ago  is   uh  83.  Yeah.  I  mean,  you  get  the  point.   You  get  the  point.   The  question  is,  do  you  trade?  Yeah,   traps  are  right  here.  So,  you  got  to  you   got  to  you're  going  to  trade  the  traps.   Exactly.  Exactly.   Um,  a  lot  of  cryptos  went  lower  than   last  bare  market  lows.  Do  you  think   Bitcoin  can  go  lower  than  the  last  cycle   lows?  I  mean,  nothing  is  impossible,   very  unlikely.  So,  I  don't  think  so.  But   is  it  out  of  the  question?  It's  not  out   of  the  question.   It's  it  could  absolutely  could   absolutely  happen,  but  u  I  I  think  it's   very  unlikely.  So,  if  you  ask  me  what  I   think,  I  don't  think  it's  going  to   happen.  I  think  we're  going  to  bottom  in   the  in  the  buy  zone.  That's  that's   that's  my  bet.   But,  if  you  want  to  be  fully  sure,  then   just  buy  it  when  the  new  bull  trend   happens.  Um  if  you  are  too  concerned  uh   let's  say  you  don't  see  this  price  as   cheap  fine  um  just  wait  for  the  bull   bull  flip  to  happen.  This  thing  is  going   down  very  very  quickly  the  bull  flip  and   uh  you  see  here  for  example  the  bottom   was  at  like  15  16k  and  already  at  22  you   got  the  bull  flip.  So  just  wait  for   that.  Uh  you  don't  have  to  guess  it's   the  best  part  with  the  with  the  money   line.  Um,  and  uh,  yeah,   that's  the  I  mean  that's  the  best  part.   You  don't  have  you  don't  have  to  worry.   You  don't  have  to  analyze  too  much   geopolitics.  Is  Iran  regime  change   bullish  or  bearish?   I  don't  know.  It's  uh,  depends  how  they   do  it.  If  it  is  like  Maduro,  maybe  it's   bullish.  If  it's  like  Maduro,  boop,  he's   gone.  Uh  if  it  is  like  a  big  war,  it's   uh  very  bearish  for  Bitcoin.  I  think   Bitcoin  is  going  to  dump  a  lot.  If  it's   real  escalation  and  a  big  uh  big  war,   big  event,  I  think  for  Bitcoin  is  going   to  be  very  bearish  shortterm.  Long-term   may  be  good,  but  the  short  term  Bitcoin   is  trading  like  uh  stocks  and  u  it's  not   trading  as  a  riskoff.  I  mean,  it  is  what   it  is.  We  want  it  to  be  riskoff.  It's   not  risk  off.  It's  heavily  risk  on.  So   should  some  bearish  articles  come  out   that  there  is  big  war,  massive  war,   maybe  you  know  Russia  is  involved,  China   like  who  the  hell  knows  I  don't know  how   it's  going  to  be.  So  it's  hard  to  say   but  um  it  is  uh  definitely  possible  that   it  goes  down  a  lot.  Uh  if  there  are  big   bad  news  in  geopolitics,  Bitcoin  is   going  to  fly  down  like  like  kaka  in  the   toilet.  Okay,  to  put  it  bluntly,  it's   going  to  fly  down  like  a  big  kaka  in  the   toilet  and  you  press  not  the  small   flush,  but  the  big  flush.  Will  it   eventually  bottom  out  and  regain  the   lead  as  some  kind  of  risk  off?  I  mean,   maybe  it's  it's  man,  it's  hard  to  say.   Gold  is  more  clear  that  it's  it's  going   to  be  benefiting  uh  because  the   investors  are  very  simple.  They  see  risk   off,  they  buy  gold.  I  mean,  it's  proven.   So,  you  can  count  on  that.  With  Bitcoin,   I  don't  think  you  can  count  on  that.  I   think  it's  going  to  fly  down  quite   heavily.  And  by  the  way,  gold  is  still   in  the  bull  trend.  So  any  kind  of  news   with  uh  Iran  or  anything  like  that  uh   will  probably  propel  this  thing  forward.   Silver  less  so  because  that  one  is  in   Brendan,  but  yeah,  gold  could  absolutely   try  to  go  to  uh  to  alltime  high.  So  I   mean  that  would  be  my  guess.  That  would   be  my  guess  with  the  uh  developments  in   geopolitics.   I  I  you  still  here?  I  used  to  watch  you   years  ago.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Welcome  back.   Welcome  back.  We're  still  here,  man.  We   haven't  left.  We've  never  left.  We're   here  every  day.  And  uh  yeah,  it's  been   fantastic,  man.  Welcome  back,  man.  What   did  you  watch  instead?  Did  your  new   influencer  tell  you  to  drisk  in  October?   Because  we  did.   What  do  you  watch  now?   I  mean,  it's  a  big  problem  because  uh   many  people  super  wrecked.  They  watch   someone  that  feeds  them  the  same  mantra.   Buy  the  dip,  buy  the  dip,  buy  the  dip,   and  go  slower.  Dip,  keeps  dipping.  So,  I   don't  know  how  much  you've  been   watching,  but  I  can  tell  you  that  we   avoided  all  like  all  of  this  on  the   screen  you  see,  we  avoided  all  of  it.   100%  of  it  we  avoided.  Since  October,  we   are  bearish.   Okay.   Since  October,  we're  bearish.  So,   welcome  back.   I  mean,  do  you  still  da?  I  don't  DCA.   Only  in  the  buy  zone.  Byzone  is  the  the   rectangle  on  the   on  the  screen  here.   DCAing  slowly  slowly  in  the  buy  zone   makes  sense.  Uh  here  we're  still  we're   still  above  it.  We're  still  but  we're   getting  close  to  it.  But  uh  yeah,  this   is  my  scenario  number  one  base  case  that   we're  going  to  the  buy  zone.  Maybe  we're   going  to  the  middle  of  the  buy  zone  here   and  you  can  accumulate  throughout.   I'm  an  idea  risk  in  October  and  buy  cost   stock  is  it  bull.  Let's  see.  Let's  see.   Cost  co cost  stock.   It  is  currently  bull.   Yeah,  I  mean  it  is  relatively  fresh  bull   trend.  Um  but  the  thing  is  you  have  to   be  a  bit  careful  here  because  I  don't   like  this.  I  don't  like  this.  This  I   don't  like  it.  It  should  go  to  I  would   say  the  the  the  best  entry  if  you  well  a   good  entry  was  here  but  let's  say  you're   not  in  Costco  now  you're  watching  this   all  of  you  other  guys  the  next  entry  is   in  case  it  breaks  alltime  high  for  sure   for  sure  because  I  don't  like  this   is  bad   it  looks  like  distribution  even  though   short-term  it's  a  bit  of  a  bull  trend   but  on  on  a  big  picture  time  frame  like   multi-year  time  frame  you  see  that  it's   kind  of  losing  momentum   If  it  smashes   above,  fantastic.  Fantastic.  So  yeah,   the  the  signal  will  be  if  it  can  smash   above  it  can  really  show  that  it's  uh  it   goes  to  alltime  high   as  know  I'm  not  a  fan  of  this  like  fake   alltime  high.  U   yeah  and  here  it  got  rejected.  Yeah.   Let's  see.  Let's  see.  It  doesn't  look   too  strong  from  a   u  from  a  Yeah.  topping  perspect   perspective.  It's  kind  of  like   distribution.   So   currently  bull  trend  you  can  definitely   ride  it  but  um  the  big  question  is  going   to  be  can  you  go  to  alltime  high  and  by   the  way  the  whole  S&P  is  exactly  the   same.   The  entire  S&P  index  is  in  exactly   exactly  the  same  cannot  really  go  to   alltime  high  and  the  big  signal  is  going   to  be  once  it  breaks  alltime  high  with   confidence.   What  influencers  do  you  think  people   should   watch  and  have  good  perspective  on  the   market?  I  would  say  don't  watch  too   many.  I  mean  a  big  problem  people  have   is  that  they  watch  so  many  they  watch  so   many  and  uh  they  watch  let's  say  they   watch  me  then  they  watch  someone  else   and  they  tell  them  something  different   your  your  brain  becomes   uh  mush  like  you  know  porridge  you  be   your  main  your  brain  is  porridge  you   hear  something  here  then  you  hear   something  else  there  you  think  that   you're  doing  something  good  because  you   watch  many  many  different  ones  in   reality  you  just  get  uh  brain  effed  in  a   big  big  Okay,  because  they  Yeah,  I  mean   the  everyone  has  their  their  different   view  and  maybe  it's  a  good  view  even  I'm   not  saying  it's  bad.  Maybe  it's  a  good   view.  Maybe  they  have  a  good  view.  But   uh  uh  in  most  strategies,  you  got  to  be   consistent  and  be  thinking  long  term.   Like  if  you  watch  my  channel,  you  get   one  perspective  and  instantly  you  go   somewhere  else,  you  get  another   perspective.  Again,  it's  kind  of a  trap   because  you  think  it's  good,  but  it's   not  good  because  different  perspectives   can  work  if  you  are  consistent  and  you   follow  through.  If  one  day  you  do  this,   one  day  you  do  something  else,  you're  uh   you're  brain.  Now,  I  don't  have  time   myself  to  watch  too  much.  So,  I  cannot   like  you  know,  how  do  you  say  uh  how  do   you  say  when  you   you  guarantee  I  cannot  uh  vet  you  100%.   Um,  but  if  you've  been  watching   different  channels,  you  know  yourself.  I   mean,  just  look  at  what  happened  since   October  and  make  your  own  conclusion.   I've  been  watching  Tom  Lee.  I  can  tell   you  he's  not  exact.  That's  not  good.   How  do  you  say  when  you  like  guarantee?   I  I  cannot  uh   I  cannot   anyway  my  the  word  is  escaping.   Not  verify.  Not  verify.  No,  I  can  vouch.   Vouch  vouch  vouch.  Do  you  say  vouch?  I   cannot  vouch.  Exactly.  I  cannot  v  vouch   for  anyone  because  I  simply  don't  watch   them  dayto  day.  Uh  but  you  probably  know   yourself.  I  mean  just  just  look  at  what   what  has  happened  uh  since  October.  You   know  yourself.   But  not  Tom  Lee.   Tom  Lee  we  watch  in  the  in  the  bull   market.  He's  going  to  be  great  in  the   bull.  And  also  not  R  Paul.  I  mean,  I   love  R  Paul,  but  it's  uh  it's  been  very   bad.  It's  been  very  bad  bullish  business   cycle,  ISM,  and  I  can  assure  you  that   also  he's  going  to  say  that  he  is  fully   correct  when  uh  we  do  eventually  pump   because  we're  going  to  we're  going  to   pump  eventually   >> and  he's  going  to  say  I  was  fully  right   business  cycle  happened.  In  the   meanwhile,  many  old  coins  did  like  this   and  many  altcoins  did  also  worse.   Celestia  down  98%.  So,   um  yeah,  but  yeah,  big  shout  I  mean  big   shout  out  to  everyone.  I  I  don't  I  don't   want  to  critique  or  review  anyone   really,  but  um  I  just  see  a  lot  of  uh   pain  and  we  have  to  address  the  pain  uh   and  learn  from  it.  Learn  from  it.   If  you  had  to  bet  on  one  scenario  for   the  next  two,  four  weeks,  break  up,   break  down  or  chop,  what's  your  uh  base   case?  My  base  case  uh  for  Bitcoin  is   that  we  go  to  the  buy  zone  is  the  base   case.  I  mean  if  I  if  I  have  to  pick   something  I  mean  my  base  case  is  on  the   screen  is  is  this  is  the  green  chart  is   the  base  case.  But  we're  not  cornered   in.  If  this  doesn't  play  out,  let's  say   we  start  pumping  a  lot,  we're  going  to   adapt.  But  now  Bitcoin  is  very  weak.  It   it  cannot  even  go  back  and  retest  74.   Um  oh  by  the  way  guys,  the  bull  flip  now   is  at  91.  That's  a  good  good  update.   Last  week  it  was  like  95  maybe.  Now  it's   so  bull  flip  is  coming  down  quite  fast   now.  Okay.  Um  that  that  that  that's  what   I  mean.  That's  what  I  mean  when  you  if   you  don't  want  to  predict  just  wait  for   it  to  turn  bullish.  Okay.  You  don't  have   to  predict.  Just  wait  for  the  bull  flip   and  that's  it.   Do  you  think  there  will  be  all  season   next  bull?  I  think  there's  always  going   to  be  some  old  season,  but  your  os  are   not  guaranteed  to  pump.  We  did  see  last   season  this  cycle  also.  I  mean,  people   say  we  never  had  old  season.  What  What   do  you  mean?  We  had  dog  with  hat  go  to  5   billion.  We  had  Pepe.  We  had  we  had  an   old  season,  but  yes,  it  wasn't  the   so-called  blue  chips.  Chainling  did  not   go  to  alltime  high.  Or  did  it  do  it?  I   don't  think  so.  Was  kind  of  sleepy  this   whole  market.  There  are  many  so-called   blue  chips  that  did  not  go  to  alltime   high.  So,  as  long  as  you  adapt  Yeah,  it   did  not  go  to  alltime  high.   Oh  my  god.  Yeah.  You  see,  so  there's   always  old  season.  Always.  It's  human   nature.  People  love  speculation.  They   love  speaking  about  coins.  New  coin.   They  also  pump  a  lot.  New  coins  pump  a   lot.  There's  always  an  incentive  to   create  a  new  coin.  People  love  to  be   early.  So  it's  it's  both  that  there  are   many  creators  of  the  coins,  but  also  the   retail,  the  general  public,  they  want  to   be  early.  They  want  to  explore.  So  there   will  always  be  all  season.  We  had  I   don't  agree  with  people  that  say  that  we   didn't  have  all  season.  We  had  all   season  dog  with  hat.  Fartcoin.   Who  who  forgot  fartcoin?   Uh  you  can  say  hyperlquid.   Uh  if  you  want,  you  know,  fundamentals,   you  can  say   Pepe.  You  can  say  uh  what  else?  Harry   Potter,  Sonic,  Ino.   See,  we  had  all  season,  guys.  They  went   to  billions.  A  lot  of  this  stuff.   Peanut.  Peanut.  What  happened  to  Peanut?   You  remember  Peanut?  Trump  coin.  So,  we   had  old  season.  I  understand  that  it  may   not  seem  that  like  old  season  and  uh   people  were  expecting  their  coins  to   pump,  but  just  because  your  coin  did  not   pump  doesn't  mean  that  there  wasn't  all   season.  Like  the  brutal  truth  is  that  I   know  it's  not  what  we  want  to  hear,  but   the  brutal  truth  is  that.  So,  there  will   always  be  season,  but  don't  take  it  as  a   as  a  guarantee  that  your  coin  is  going   to  pump.  Guys,  by  the  way,  the  more  I   look  at  this  chain  link  chart,  the  more   it  seems  to  me  that  if  it  breaks  this   support,  it's  going  to  go  here.  Okay.   Uh,  now  that  I  zoomed  out  the  chart  a   bit,  holy  crap,  guys.  You  see  here,  it's   kind  of  now  at  the  support  of  this  20.   Oh  my  god.

We're  going  to  we're  going  to  be  back  to   the  range.  Okay.  Very  interesting  stuff,   guys.  Very  interesting  stuff.  Any  guys,   thanks  a  lot  for  being  here.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin és az altcoinok árfolyama egy zuhanás következtében csökken, amit a befektetői közösség régóta várt. A konszolidáció, amely február elején kezdődött, valószínűleg a további visszaesés előtt áll. Mivel az év középső időszaka következik, a BTC esetében várható egy kisebb emelkedés a következő 10 napon belül, de az általános nyomás továbbra is nagymértékű. A videó fő üzenete az, hogy a befektetőknek érdemes a 'buy zone'-ban apránként vásárolni, még a további csökkenés ellenére is, mivel a piacon bármikor változások következhetnek be. A bearish trend ellenére a közösség aktivitása pozitív, és a shortolási stratégiák népszerűek. Az ETH és más altcoinok, mint például a Solana, iránti érdeklődés az ipar jövője szempontjából is megmutatkozik, miközben a videóban említett piaci ellenállások figyelembevétele elengedhetetlen.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin and altcoins are experiencing a significant decline in prices, a scenario anticipated by the investing community for some time. The consolidation noted since early February is likely a precursor to further downturns. Given the mid-year historical trends, a minor uptick in BTC's value can be expected in the next ten days, however, immense pressure remains on its overall performance. The main takeaway encourages investors to begin purchasing gradually within the 'buy zone,' despite expectations of further declines, as market conditions can change rapidly. Despite the bearish trend, community engagement appears to be positive, with a focus on shorting strategies. Interest in ETH and other altcoins like Solana highlights shifts in the sector's landscape, while closely monitoring mentioned market resistances is essential.",
