        "transcript": "Are you familiar with NFTTS, crypto? >> Yeah, I don't like it. >> Why not? >> Cuz you can't see them. You can't touch them. You can't feel them. You can't put ketchup on them.

Most are backed one to one by real reserves. Here's the simplest example, the US dollar. Coins like USDC or USDT are basically digital version of the dollar.
