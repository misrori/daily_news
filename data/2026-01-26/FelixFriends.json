        "transcript": "Something absolutely wild just happened in the mining sector and I need to tell you about it right now. The US government just wrote a 1.6 billion dollar check to one mining company most people have never heard of. We're talking about the largest government investment in rare earths in American history. And buried in all that chaos is what I believe could be one of the most significant investment opportunities we've seen in a decade or more. You get this wrong, you could be buying at the worst possible time. You get this right, well, good stuff could happen. And literally, as I'm recording this, Reuters just broke the news there could be a lot more to this. The US is also introducing a bill to create a stockpile of critical minerals. And apparently all the other seven large countries in the world, G7, are doing the same thing. So, opportunity is knocking. My name is Felix Freed. I'm an ex investment banker. That's Winston back there, who's the brains of the operation. Very large nose, very good at sniffing out good stocks. I'm also the founder of the Goat Academy. We've helped about 20,000 students learn how to trade and invest better and safer. I'm also the co-founder of tradevision.io, which I'll be using during this video because it's how we stay up todate with what's actually happening out there. the same level of detail and information that Wall Street has access to. Our mission here is essentially very simple. I want to help regular investors, which is what I used to be like you, understand what the smart money already knows before it shows up on CNBC 3 weeks later. You know what I mean? So, I'm not telling you to run out and buy anything. No, I'm not your financial adviser. I'm not a financial adviser. Not registered with absolutely anything. Winston might be when I'm not. And I don't know your situation. But what I'm going to do is walk you through exactly what's happening. Show you the specific stocks involved that I have given also to my students. So this is like a peak behind the curtain. I give you also the risks and the opportunities and then you can do your own research, make your own decisions. Does that sound fair? If it sounds fair, put an F in the chat or in the comments and let's freaking go. So here's the deal that shocked the world, particularly the Wall Street world. Trump announced a $1.6 billion investment in USA, USA rare earths, ticker symbol USA. And in exchange for that money, the US government gets a 10% stake in the company. So, let me translate that for you. The government became a major shareholder in a mining company. Remember the last time that happened? So, this isn't the government giving out loans to some boring development bank. This is Papa Sam saying, \"We're going into the mining business.\" Yeah. It's no longer drill, baby drill. It's dig, baby, dig. So, the government is investing in what they say is critical to national security. Now, why do we care? Why does the US government care? Why does our rare earth so important? And why now? Well, rare earth elements are 17 specific metals that you've probably never heard of. things like neodymium and prodmium and displosium and weird things sort of Harry Potter spell sounding minerals but the thing is you can't build any modern technology without these every single electric motor needs it every rare earth magnet is built from that every wind turbine every F-35 fighter jet yeah it's loaded with rare earths your iPhone yeah rare earths in there too so the problem here is well it's an opportunity now there is a geopolitical reality here and that is that China controls 90% of global rare earth processing not the mining the processing because rare earths aren't that rare that's it's weirdly named they're not that rare actually they're kind of everywhere all over the place but processing them it's kind of dirty it's expensive it's complicated some have like radiation radiation issues can take years to set that up. So for the last 30 years, we basically said, \"All right, uh, let's send it to somewhere far away and let them deal with it.\" That's essentially what happened. And now, shockingly, the US has discovered that maybe relying on well, what appears to be a rivalry between these two nations, um, if you need your opponent to build weapons system, might not be the smartest strategic decision, right? So there have been a few presidents there who somebody should just walk up to and you know shake them very gently. I'm not proposing any violence against former uh presidents. That would not be a good thing I imagine. But what is it that is actually going on here? What is USA? What are they actually building? So they're not just digging up rocks these guys. And I'm going to give you a whole list of stocks that I believe will benefit from this tremendously by the way. So so stick around. But they're building what they call a mine tomagnet supply chain. And that means they mine the stuff. They've got a massive deposit called Round Top in Sierra Blanca uh in Texas, which sounds like a sort of um a kind of place you should you should film at Western, isn't it? Uh anyway, never been there in my life. Never been to Texas. I hear it's a fun place. But they have 15 of the 17 rare earth metals right there. Right now, the second thing is they're going to process it, right? turn that ore into usable rare earth oxides and then they're going to manufacture magnets from them. So they're building a massive 310,000 square ft magnet facility in Still Water, Oklahoma, all of America, all controlled domestically. And the mine, the Roundtop mine is expected to start operations by 2028. You're like 2028? It's too far away. Well, in mining world, it's like it's like a second. Takes ages to develop this stuff. The factory, it's supposed to come online this year. First commercial production line actually in 2026. So, I guess they're going to buy in some minerals and then process them. So, now let me ask you this. Do you think the US government would write a $ 1.6 billion check if they thought this was, you know, nonsense? This is a bet that rare earths are going to be absolutely critical for the next decade and beyond. And whoever controls the supply chain controls the future. It's bright. It's orange. It's it's a random reference there for my my my British viewers. Now, here is where this gets important for us as investors. Everyone's talking about AI, right? Chat, GPT, Claude, all these large language models. Everyone thinks AI is just software, just code sitting in some cloud somewhere. Well, it's what? AI is massively physical and it's creating an absolute feeding frenzy for raw materials. Let me show you why. Data centers are the new factories. AI models need enormous computing power which means enormous data centers. So by 2030, which is in only four years, which is kind of weird because that used to be the future, data centers are going to consume 1,000 terowatt hours of electricity. Now, I don't really know what that means, but it sounds like a lot. But I can put it into perspective, right? I always say we shouldn't make a video without digging on the French. Uh, here we are. Uh, the entire electricity consumption of France is what the data centers will use. Doesn't make you so big and proud now, does it my French viewers? So, what does it mean for us? Well, all right. So, we've got some metals here, right? We're going to go through the metals and we're going to go through the actual stocks to see, you know, which are the right ones. Copper. Copper is the king metal. Every single data center needs massive amount of copper for power transmission. Think wiring, cooling systems, backup generators. The AI sector could account for 3% of global copper demand. Doesn't sound like a lot, right? 3%. But you see, there is already a deficit. There's more demand for copper than there is actually copper being dug out of the ground. It's been a deficit since 2024 and it's expected to stay in deficit through all of this year and beyond. So, think about that. Demand's going up. Supply isn't keeping up the pace and we're about to add the equivalent of France's power consumption in new data centers, right? So, what happens to prices when supply is tight and demand goes? I'll let you work that one out for yourself. You can put it in the comments if you thought you had a particularly brilliant thought around this subject. Now, steel and aluminium, which is, you know, Winston, they are also really boring, but they can make a lot of money. Each hypers scale data center, the bigger ones, require 20,000 tons of steel just for the structure. Tons of aluminium for the server racks and the heat sinks. It's not sexy. Nobody's making YouTube videos about aluminum, but when you need 20,000 tons of it for one building and you're building hundreds of these things, well, then that's kind of gets interesting. And then, of course, we got what everybody talks about, which is chips, right? The GPUs that actually run these AI models. They're going to be TPUs and CPUs, but it's all chips. Just chips, right? Not the stuff you can eat, but the, you know what I mean? Um, now these things are kind of miraculous, but they need a bunch of stuff to operate. They think need things like gallium, which I don't know why it's called gallium. German germanmanium. It sort of sounds like what was that? What was that cartoon with me a little? There was a big fat guy who was throwing rocks at Roman soldiers and they were always in France, right? That was in in in Gaul, which is old word for France. And then Germanium sounds like Germany, doesn't it? Very odd. Anyway, my mind wanders. Um, gallium is essential for high performance ships. Geranium is used for fiber optics, for high-speed data transmissions. And then there's the fun part. Well, China controls 98% of gallium and 60% of geranium production, right? So, the US might want to build some of that. So, Silicon Valley is uh kind of going, yeah, guys, you got to you got to do something about it. Now, how did the US get here? Well, Silicon Valley runs the the tech world and and they're going to buy it wherever it's cheapest until the US government literally passes a law forcing them to stop, which is what just happened basically. So before we dive into the actual stocks, I want you guys to not follow random stock picks on YouTube because it's going to get you into trouble. I want you guys to understand the actual principle behind it so you can make better decisions. How do you learn the actual principle? Well, I learned it from my mentors who are Wall Street guys. And I will show you in a second. By the way, in our community, I put out a a a watch list every Sunday with the actual stocks. So, we're going to look at those in a second. But if you want to be smart about this and you want to actually have the skills, so you're not just buying something and then go, \"Wait, wait, when do I sell?\" Which is what people always say to me. I'm like, \"You should have figured that out before you bought it, right?\" Which is an annoying thing to say, but it's true. So, if you want to learn that process, go to felix.org/getfree. It's short video. I think it's 17 minutes long. And I actually walk you through the actual physical hard steps of sector selection, stock selection, and and and and when we exit. So if you want to get a little bit deeper into managing your money in a more serious fashion, I'd highly recommend you do that. There's a link to it down below, felix.org/getfree. But before we dive into the individual names and and we shall uh will you talk about the bigger picture because we're seeing something that isn't just one company or one metal going up, we're potentially of the start of what's called a super cycle. Now, what's a super cycle? Well, a super cycle is basically when commodity prices stay way above normal for a really, really, really, really long time. So, we're talking 10, 15, sometimes 20 years. This isn't just a normal boom and bust cycle where prices go up for 18 months and then crash, which is usually what happens. This is a structural thing. This is long-term demand that isn't going away. Now, the last big super cycle was from 2000 to 2014. Why do we have that super cycle? China built China. You know, all the infrastructure. If you've been, everything is modern. High-rise buildings, high-speed trains, infrastructure, just everywhere, right? Brand new airports, all that kind of stuff. So, they build a lot. And if you own mining stocks during that time, you did very, very, very well. You Australians down there under you. You know what I'm talking about, right? That that drove the big the big Australia boom. And I I used to work for McQuary, a big Australian bank. So, a lot of my friends spent a lot of money on that. Now, since the beginning of 2025, the metals and mining index has gained nearly 90%. It's outperformed tech stocks. It's outperformed everything. And yet, mining stocks are still trading at a 20% discount to their price to book ratio compared to the broader market. So, the sector is up 90%. And it's still relatively cheap compared to history. So, what does that tell you? It tells you the market is just starting to wake up to this. Wake up people. Right. So the super cycle is being driven by three massive trends happening at the same time. We have the AI boom. I just showed you that data centers, the chips, the infrastructure. This isn't going to go away. AI only just started. It's like the internet in, you know, 1997 or something. The energy transition comes with electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels, all incredibly metal intensive. An EV, an electric vehicle user, uses three times more copper than a regular gas. A single wind turbine uses about 4.7 tons of copper. And then you get defense. Countries are rearming. Defense budgets are going up. The US, Trump wants to put up the defense budget by 60%. Every missile, every jet, every ship is loaded with copper, aluminium, rare earths, uranium, all that stuff. And what are they building? Well, they're building more electric things, right? Drones, autonomous tanks and planes and ships and submarines. What are they all going to need? Well, a ton of all the things to make electric motors with, which is rare earth minerals. So, you've got this three secular trends thing happening at the same time, all multi-deade, all requiring the same materials. And the problem is, and again, the opportunity, if you're positioned correctly, the supply side is broken. We've been underinvesting in new mines for over a decade. Why? Because after the last super cycle crashed by 2015, nobody wanted to touch mining. It was like the crazy thing. Don't touch mining. Prices were low. Returns were terrible. No one's going to go, I'm going to invest in 5 years and open a new mine hoping that this is going to turn around. That's how we get late this. And just to give you an idea how slow it is to build a mine. The average thing about mining is that from discovery to production, the average lead time is how many years? Give me a guess. Give me a guess. Go on. 16 years. Do you think that you probably thought three or five, right? No. 16 years. I've got a friend actually who has a gold mine. He's been talking about that thing for years. They haven't dug a thing out of the ground yet. Now, what that means is that even we're going to start building new mines today. Say copper mines, which we aren't, by the way. They wouldn't come online until 2042. Meaning demand is going vertical right now. Supply deficits are everywhere. Copper, silver, nickel. Silver has been a supply deficit for seven years. Seven straight years of consuming more than we mine. Eventually that math stops working, right? Because we get out of the stock piles get reduced which is have a look at the silver price. Have you seen the silver price? This is the silver price, right? Uh was that there's no one could anybody could have seen that coming. Well, if you watch my training, um, you you will probably disagree with that statement. felix.org/getfree. Check that out. So, let's get into specific companies. So, I'm going to focus on the most interesting ones, the ones that are actual catalysts, real projects that aren't just some, you know, explorer with a hole in the ground and and a dream. So, let's break down six opportunities, six stocks, and also tell you how you can stay in touch with those. So, USA. Now, what I'm going to do here, this is in trade vision. There's a link down below. you can get yourself a free trial to it. I'm going to create a watch list and we're going to call it mining top six and I'm going to add these stocks to it. So, this one is USA. And the really cool thing we're going to do with this is that when you go to the homepage, you can select your mining top six, which obviously at the moment is just one stock. And then you can turn on the top right here, news alerts. that little that little alarm bell up there is news alerts. And you can do that for all of your watch lists. Turn it on, turn it off. The beautiful thing with that is that you're then going to get updates when something happens with these stocks that we believe is going to move the market and happens in almost real time. And it looks something like that. You can I don't know if that focuses. Does that focus? There we go. Right. So, you can see just sort of what that looks like. Uh and that's what I get. I obviously follow a lot of stocks. You might follow a lot less. And it means you don't have to dig through the news. doesn't have to wonder whether something is happening. You just are informed. You're just up to date. Right? So, USA is the first one. Now, by the way, we started talking about that one in August last year. Hasn't honestly done a lot since. Um, we were a little early to the to the story, but I think my humble opinion that right now is is another one of these big breakouts that we about to see. Risk management is key with all of these because they're fairly volatile. But they, as I say, they just got the 1.6 billion from the government. That's a pretty pretty important thing. So, they're the only fully integrated minetom magnet supply chain in America, right? Deposit in Texas, 15 out of the 17 rare earths, uh, plus also lithium and gallium. The government literally owns 10% of a company, which means they have a vested interest. So, if you US if you're a US defense contractor, um, wouldn't you love to have domestic tariff proof supply of rare earth magnets? If you're the defense department, you're probably going to guarantee the output. you're going to buy it, right? So, first production here is going to come online this year. That's the expectation. Not 10 years away, but months away. Now, what's the bare case? They're not making anything yet. It's a development story, right? Development stories can go wrong. Permits can get delayed. But given that the government owns 10%, maybe that will, you know, offset some of the risk. The mine, as I said, doesn't start in 2028. That's two years away. So, if Earth prices collapse between now and then, everything changes. But, let's be honest, the government isn't exactly known for picking winners in the private market. So that's why I I advocate very very strong risk management for this. Second stock is MP materials. And again, I'm going to add that to um my list. So I just pop in here and I just click on the little little plus symbol here next to my list. Add MP materials to the list. Yeah, there we go. Now we've got it there. And then if we were to go back to our heat map, we can now see both of them at the same time. Right? You can see how that's popping. Right? You can see how it's popping. You're also now seeing news articles here related to your watch list. You see how how clever that is? I think it's very clever. Uh so get yourself a free trial to to trade vision is down below. Um now MP materials and and again we've talked about MP materials in the past. I don't know if I have a marker on that. I think here here 28th of April we had an entry point. Uh we actually I think I actually bought it on the 5th of June and it went on a beautiful run and it pulled back and I got out of it. Um which is what I always suggest you do. Don't get married to a stock. Hold it because you want to make money out of it. They're the only largecale rare earth producer in the western hemisphere right now. They operate the mountain pass mine in California. They're already producing. So a development story. So their board case here is that they have record production of neodymium presium. However the heck you anybody pronounces that whatever that might be. It goes into magnets. That's all I know. Um he taught me that. So, they're building their own magnet manufacturing on top of that in Texas. All things seems to center around Texas. And they have a multi-year supply agreement with a little company may never have heard of Apple. Yeah. They have partnerships with the US Department of Defense. Sorry, Woo. And it's an established company with real revenue, real customers, and real production. Stocks at 230% last year. Despite that run, they're still trading at a significant discount to their peak valuations. bare case. Well, they up quite a lot, right? Rare earth prices are volatile. If prices drop, margins compress and blah blah blah. So, the transition from concentrate producer to magnet manufacturer is also something that is riskier because they haven't done it before, but this is a more established, but you're not getting at the ground floor like you might be with USA potentially, right? Stock numero is Uroy. We're talking about that. I also owned that at some point last year. So, let's type that in here as well. Uroy and then again we add that to our watch list here and that's had also a a lovely little run up but it's still significantly lower than it was in 2021 and the demand is significantly stronger in my humble opinion as a financial advice. You got to do your own research but let's really talk uranium here because the AI boom is creating a nuclear renaissance. Uh I also talk sometimes about the fact that global warming was pitched as carbon pollution only and we should care about no other pollutants except for carbon. And then for some strange coincidence turns out that nuclear power produces no carbon. No, it's just purely clean. There's nothing wrong with that whatsoever. There's no radiation. There's no waste. It is just a beautiful technology and we should all have one in our backyard. Um at least that's what Bill Gates says. So all those data centers need clean power. It's clean now. You see what they did? Do you remember how much the world loathed nuclear power after um all those power plants went up and you know Ukraine and Japan and so on and now it's clean. It's it's good for the planet. Um but there is of course truth in it that solar and wind can't do it. You actually need backup consistent power because those two are intermittent, right? when the sun doesn't shine, when the wind doesn't blow or it blows too much. Those things don't really work. Coal and gas, they're not very popular with the uh we hate carbon crowd because apparently they pollute very badly. So, what what have you got left? You got nuclear. So, to me, the whole thing is just a beautiful marketing scheme of the nuclear industry. And and and you know, you might disagree with unviolently. Let me know down below in the comments. Someone's going, \"Felix, stop with the politics. You know nothing about this. It's real.\" It might well be real. just saying it's being hijacked, right? Um or what what what I really love is when I when I talk about the um Soviet Socialist States of Europe, uh also known as the European Union and then and then the Europeans really kick off. You have no idea. And the funny thing about them is that they never say why I'm wrong. They always just say it's much worse in other countries. That's always the defense. I'm like, yeah, I wasn't saying it wasn't worse in, you know, I don't know, North Korea. Uh but um I'm just saying it's not very good where you are. Um, and that really takes some people off, which is kind of funny really. Anyway, um, we have offended the Europeans and the French. I'm I'm keeping keeping a score, which is good. Um, apparently the French are European too. Um, now Euroy, what about Euro? They don't operate any mines. And this is why I like them. They own royalty interest in uranium projects. That means when those mines make uranium, Euroy gets a percentage of the revenue or production. So it's passive income then your operational headaches plus they hold physical uranium probably you know under the bed uh which goes up in value if uranium prices go up. So the bull case is that tech giants like u like Microsoft um you know founded by one of the kindest most generous most beautiful souls in the world as we all agree and Google and Amazon they're all looking at nuclear power for the data scientists in fact Microsoft is actually invested in one very heavily they all doing so uranium demand is structural and it's long term once you have a power plant you need more uranium so Uroy has a strong debt-free balance sheet they're diversified across multiple projects not not depending on just one Right. And if uranium prices go up, Euroy benefits directly without having to dig a hole. Right. What's the bare case? Nuclear is still controversial in many places. Apparently, I'm controversial. Permits can take forever, but I think they're going to speed them up. And uranium prices are volatile. Now, if data center operators somehow decide, uh, we can do all of this with, I don't know, natural gas or, you know, a lot of stuff and and on on treadmills, then maybe the rally won't happen. But I like Uroy because there's less downside risk. There's less leverage in a company like this. Now, a stock numo quat is TMC, the Metals company. It sort of says it on the tin, doesn't it? So, let's put TMC on our list as well. And again, add that to the list here. Bada bing. And what do they do? Well, this one's a little bit wild to be honest with you. It's a they're pioneering deep sea mining, right? I mean, as if mining wasn't difficult enough, let's do it underwater, like 10,000 ft. So, they're going after poly metallic nodules. I don't know what that means, but I read it on ocean floors. And they're apparently potato- sized rocks. I mean, literally, and I could have just made this up. It's not like anybody's been down there, right? They're potato- sized rocks that are rich in nickel, copper, and cobalt, and manganese. I use manganesees for painting, actually. It's very nice. Um, so basically all the stuff you need for electric vehicle batteries. They're sitting apparently at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. As I say, they could have just made it up and and it could just be the biggest Ponzi scheme in the world because no one's been down there. But let's just say that um there is something in this because just beginning of this year, they became the first company to file a consolidated application for exploration and commercial recovery under a new per US permitting process. Because I imagine they went to the permitting board and said, \"We'd like to dig.\" And like, \"Oh, where's your mine?\" And like, \"It isn't a mine. It's potatoes, right? Where are your potatoes?\" On the sea floor, really deep down. They're like, \"Oh.\" Right. Anyway, it's a big deal. They're ahead of everybody else in that regulatory framework. And they have an offtake agreement with Glenor. Now, Glenor is one of the world's largest commodity traders. They are the people who look after all the orphans and all the fluffy bunnies in the world. Those kind of people. But if deep sea mining were to work, it could unlock one of the largest untapped mineral resources on the planet. Now, environmentally, it might be cleaner than traditional mining because we're not destroying mountains. We're just bothering some weird looking fish, so we won't notice it. We'll feel better about it. Um, what's the bare case? Well, it's never been done before, ever. There are huge environmental concerns. Apparently the uh the the weird sort of translucent puffer fish are are very concerned about it and are forming a union and regulatory approval could take a while because nobody understands what the heck these guys are doing. Tech is entirely unproving and it could be a very expensive science experience that pisses off jellyfish. So this is high risk. Uh it is also potentially high reward. It's a speculative play. Now can we do moonshots in a responsible way? In my humble opinion, yes. But we have to make it very small. We have to have some risk parameters attached around it that are automated. Again, you want to learn more about that, go watch the free masterclass, the 17-minute video, felix.org/getfree. Um, so you're conservative investors, you're going to be shaking your head. U maybe you got a chuckle out of it. But there is somebody else. There is CRML. We're going to be adding that to our mining top six as well. A nice little recovery here, but actually to me that looks very good. Volume is picking up steam. Um what do they do? Well, they're an exploration company. They sort of go through the jungle and they look for the um you know, Raiders of the Lost Ark type thing. And they found something called the Tambre Rare Earth Project in guess where? Penguin Land, Greenland. So, they've done some recent drilling um that confirmed they have highgrade mineralization, particularly heavy rare earths. They're planning a joint venture to build a rare earth processing facilities with the penguins. So this is an earlier stage than USA or MP materials, but it is a worldclass asset in a I was going to say stable jurisdiction. I'm not sure that's entirely true. No, I actually think Greenland's a very stable jurisdiction. I think Trump never really was going to invade it or anything insane like that. He just goes in and he says, \"I want it.\" And then they say, \"Well, we don't want to do that.\" up and you say, \"Well, I cannot have the mineral rights and can I do whatever I want?\" And then they go, \"Yeah.\" Right? So anyway, risk, no production yet. Um, years away from from from revenue. Um, but you know, penguin management, right? So, you got to you got to take your pick here. Uh, here's another one. Um, this is a gold stock. And if you've been asleep on the whole gold trend, gold is uh it's done relatively well. All right. Relatively well. Uh it's been a it's been a good year for us because we started getting into gold miners at around about May last year I think right when gold and it gold didn't do anything for a while but then gold caught up and now gold is up 56%. But a gold company here called Guro and again I'm going to add that to our list um five down and one one left to go is also had a very good year. Now as you can see this is a little bit of of a of a of a of a cyclical beast. So, this was one one's trading at $31. It's trading at $161 right now. Yeah, that's down a lot. I'm just going to leave it at that. Actually, let me go on a on a month chart and then I might be able to squeeze it on the chart here. How much is that down, mate? Anybody? We're down 94%. So, say the insane thing was going to happen and it would recover back to original levels because I'm not promising you that would be a 1,000 but a 2,000% gain. And again, that's not definitely not a promise of of those kind of crazy outcomes. What do they do? They're a precious metal producer. They had a major operational turnaround in late 2025. They started identifying as a potentially profitable business again. Whereas prior to that, they were just a bunch of lunatics running the asylum. And they have highgrade production from the three sisters area at the Don David Gold Mine in Mexico. Didn't you like how I just said like I knew where that was? I have no idea why that is, but apparently it is in Mexico. And that drove strong cash flow. The company is debtree, which doesn't really happen to mining companies. Silver accounts for the majority of their revenue. And silver, if you've been asleep, has industrial uses. Solar panels, electronics, every AI chip has silver in it. And they're also advancing the back 40 project in Michigan, which is a large scale development in the US. The risk is um they're operating in Mexicans, right? Tequila is good. Uh the food has apparently an impact on your digestion. And I'm sorry, my Mexican friends. You know what I'm saying? It is a uh it is not essentially the most um how shall I put it? Uh law abiding, you know, sort of space. Uh that's kind of the risk here. Goro. Now, did we miss one? MP TSMC user. We didn't put the last one on the list, right? CRML. Did we add other to the list? We did not. CRML Winston, you should pay attention, right? Let's add that to the list here, too. And then we can go and look at our new heat map and we're now informed about this. We've got a little alert bell. So, we're going to get notifications and we can also see the news articles in here. And then if you want to go back to looking at, you know, just the S&P 500, you can go back to the S&P 500. You want to switch back to your uh mining top six list, you know, you you've got your mining top six list. So, and in in trade vision, what could go wrong? Well, um, mining is cyclical. That's really what I want to say on that subject. I'm going to give you a little bit more more detail than that. Um, commodities can swing 20 to 30% in a week. Um, China could cut off exports. It could flood the market one way or the other. Uh, and what if technology changes? What if we get, I don't know, fusion power in a, you know, in your your coffee cup. Um, or or we get new magnet technology that doesn't need any magnets or technology or or minerals. Uh apparently uh there is a potential replacement for silver. The solar industry is working on that. So if prices go up too much, people are going to try and find an alternative. That's the risk, but it's probably going to take quite a long time. We also have regulatory issues, execution, maybe you're late. Um but what's the big picture? Well, the government has put $1.6 billion into this. This not the first investment in the rare earth sector. The AI boom is building this massive infrastructure that's all going to need more of these metals, including silver. So, I think we're at the early stages of a metal super cycle. Winston, any thoughts? Shall we wake him? Winston, what do you think about the metal super cycle? It's not a go for it. I go back to sleep. Um, all right. So, if we hit a global recession, you there's all that stuff that can happen. So, I'm not telling you to buy anything. I'm not saying this is guaranteed. I'm not saying there aren't risk. Do your own research on the stands. The risk size appropriately. That's the most important thing with anything. But, I think it's a sector worth paying attention to. Fundamentals are real. We got demand. We got deficit. and supply. We got government intervention and if the super cycle plays out, I think we can make some real money here over the next 3 to 10 years, but it's not a promise of future outcomes. Smart money is already moving in. So, if you want to learn how to pick those stocks, how to pick those sectors, how to position, and all that kind of good stuff, then please watch the mini masterclass at felix.org/getree. Get yourself informed by hopping onto Trade Vision and make sure you actually know what the heck's going on here because this happens every single day. We only give you the news that we think is going to move the market like live. We don't give you all the noise and jibber and bollocks political opinion on stuff. Obviously, I spout some out, but I generally just take the piss out of whoever is is is running um the country. Uh whoever thinks they're running the country, which might be a whole another conversation. So, understand the risk. If you got some value out of this, well, help some other poor folks out and share this video. And that's all I would say. And Winston, any final words? Come here. Come on. Come on, Winston. Come on. Oh, you sleepy creature. We did a long hike yesterday, which was lovely. And then he did a pretty tough playtime this morning with his friends, so that's why he's looking as sleepy as he is. I wish you guys a uh beautiful, successful year. All the best. Two months ago, I told you that Japan's debt crisis was going to crash your portfolio. Most people ignored me, of course, but get well, guess what just happened? Japan's 30-year"
