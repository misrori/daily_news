        "transcript": "We have a supersonic tsunami of AI coming. Firstly, I've got a Google DeepMind CEO and founder Deis Saris who's just put a number on AI disruption that actually stunned me. 10 times bigger than the industrial revolution and coming 10 times faster. Then we've got the Anthropic CEO and founder Dario Emodi who reveals something anthropic have built internally because they've realized the government can't track what's actually happening fast enough. And he too is predicting some huge GDP gains. And then finally, I've got a bonus clip from Bill Gates who explains where he's focusing on when it comes to AI. Brace yourself for three of the biggest people in tech. Look, I think it's it's it's it's going to be an age of disruption just like the industrial revolution was. Maybe 10x of that, which is kind of unbelievable to think about, and 10 times faster. So, I usually describe it as going to be 10 times bigger and 10 times faster than the industrial revolution. 100x so 100x of it. Um, no, I say this to everyone, but I think um that comes with it huge opportunities. And and I also am just a big believer in human ingenuity. We're extremely adaptable because our minds are so general. You know, the human mind is very general. We've adapt to look at the modern world around us. We, you know, our huntergatherer minds have managed to build modern civilization. So, I think we'll adapt again. I think it's a little bit unprecedented because of the speed of it. Usually, it takes one generation or two generations for a transformation like this to happen and the magnitude of the the transformative power of this technology. But I I think um the kids today, you know, I'd be encouraging them to get incredibly proficient with these new tools and and native with them and they're almost equivalent of giving uh them superpowers, you know, in the creative arts that you could probably do the job of, you know, what would have taken 10 people uh in in one. And I think that means um you know if you're entrepreneurial, if you're creative with game design, films projects, you can probably get a lot more done and break into those industries a lot more easily than you could in in the past as you know a new upcoming talent. >> Some folks have advocated for a pause to give regulation time to catch up, to give society time to sort of adjust to some of these changes. In a perfect world, if you knew that >> every other company would would pause, if every country would pause, would you advocate for that? >> I think so. I mean, I've been on record saying what I'd like to see happen. This was always my dream of the the kind of the road map at least I had when I started out deep mind 15 years ago and started working on AI, you know, 25 years ago now, was that as we got close to this moment, this threshold moment of AGI arriving. Um, uh, we would maybe collaborate, uh, you know, in a scientific way. I I sometimes talk about setting up an international CERN equivalent for AI where all the best minds in the world would collaborate together uh uh and and and do the final steps in a very rigorous scientific way involving all of society, maybe philosophers and social scientists and economists as well as technologists um to kind of figure out what we want from this uh technology and how to utilize it in a in a in a way that benefits all of humanity. And I think that's what's at stake. Um unfortunately it kind of needs international collaboration though because even if one company or even one nation or what even the west decided to do that um it's has no use unless the whole world agrees at least on some kind of minimum standards and you know international cooperation's a little bit tricky at the moment. So um that's going to have to change if we want to to to to have that kind of um rigorous scientific approach to the final steps to AGI. So if AGI comes in let's say 2030, we don't have the regulations set up yet. Are we destined for something difficult? >> Well, then we're, you know, I I doesn't I think I'm still optimistic that enough of the leading players will uh uh uh uh kind of communicate together and hopefully collaborate at least on things like safety and security protocols. There's a lot of that already. We work, you know, quite closely with Anthropic, for example, on those things. And um that would be needed then, you know, maybe kind of more uh uh peer-based cooperation if we can't get that international thing to work. But I would, you know, that would be a lot more pressure to cooperate with you. >> Um I potentially I'm, you know, I think I'm on pretty good terms with pretty much all the other leaders of all the leading labs. I I mean I think if the stakes are high enough and I think a lot of it is uh understanding what's at stake um and what the risks are and uh and I think that will become clearer to everyone in the next 2 3 years. AI is compressing a century of industrial revolution disruption into 5 years and how institutions can't adapt fast enough. So Deis does the math that sounds almost absurd until you think about it. 10x bigger and 10x faster equates to a 100x. The industrial revolution took about 80 years to fully transform society. Factories, railroads, urbanization, and new legal systems, labor laws, public education. All of that emerged over three or four generations. People had time to adapt. Your grandfather was a farmer. Your father worked in a factory, and you went to a new kind of school that prepared you for industrial work. The system caught up because they had decades to figure things out. Now, compress that into 5 or 10 years. That's what Demis is describing. And I think the speed problem is actually worse than the scale problem. Our institutions, government, education, labor markets, they're designed to move slowly. That's a feature, not a bug most of the time. You want deliberation. You want checks and balances, although even that's debatable if moving slow is better at all. But when the underlying technology is moving at AI speed, slow institutions become a liability. And the part that stuck out to me is when he talks about his dream of a CERN style international collaboration of AI. He's basically admitting that the current approach, companies racing, countries competing, regulators scrambling to catch up, probably isn't the right structure for something this big, and he's been thinking about this for 15 years. This isn't some new concern Demis developed last month. But what makes this tricky is the international coordination problem. Even if the US and Europe agree to slow down to be more deliberate, that only works if China agrees too. And right now, international cooperation on anything is pretty strained. So, we're probably heading into this transformation without the collaborative scientific approach Demis is describing. That means the burden falls on individual companies and informed relationships between lab leaders, which I mean is something, but it's not the rigorous societywide process that Demis is talking about. So that's the macro picture. Unprecedented speed, institutions that can't keep up. But Anthropic is actually trying to solve part of this problem in a pretty interesting way. Dario Modi runs the company that makes Claude, and he's describing something they built internally called the Anthropic Economic Index. It tracks how AI is affecting jobs in real time, not through surveys or annual reports, but by analyzing actual conversations with Claude. And his reason for building it tells you a lot about where we are. Yeah. what what are the individual let me just get to what I think the kind of the situation is you know I think exactly what you said I think we could have this very unusual combination of very fast GDP growth and high unemployment or at least undermployment or you know low-wage job a lot of low-wage jobs high inequality I don't think that's a macro correct me if I'm wrong I don't think that's a macroeconomic combination we've ever seen before you think of fast growth you're like well Okay, maybe there's inflation, but you know, you're you're not going to have high unemployment when there's fast growth. I I I think this technology is a bit different because it's extreme in the way in in the way it's going to it's going to it's going to generate value, but also because it's moving up the cognitive waterline, there's going to be unfortunately a whole class of people who are who are, I think, across a lot of industries going to have a hard time coping. And that's really a problem we need to solve. So to to get to the question you just asked, there's a few things anthropic is doing. One is we've maintained for almost a year now what we call the entropic economic index which is tracking how our models are used in real time and and because we see all these conversations we can use claude itself to in a privacy preserving manner look across all the conversations and ask questions like is someone using this to augment a task to work together with the model or to delegate or fully automate a task what are the industries people are using quad force statistically by distribution. What are the subtasks within those industries? Right? We can get into, you know, a lot of these like labor, you know, these very fine grain labor department statistics and ask cla about it. Which states are using claude more? What is it? We can watch the economic diffusion of claude in real time. And and so the reason to do all this is that I don't think you can make good policy if you don't have the right data. And I worry that the data that the government produces as comprehensive as it is just doesn't move fast enough and isn't detailed enough for this. So, so you know that is that is kind of our first contribution. We are thinking increasingly about this kind of I don't know if you want to call it retraining or ability to help people adapt. It's it's partly in line with kind of what we do in terms of go to market right part of our go to market activity is how to help people adapt. >> There was great great respect. I mean you can do these things but fundamentally it's a societal problem you know government if you think about it what you're describing is a perfect storm you have GDP going up the wealth of certain people going massively absolutely and you are saying 50% of you know entry- level jobs go people in real distra you are surely going to see a political change coming from this and my personal bet would be yes you're going to get people trying to restrain the tech barons but you would also get people saying let's have higher taxes. We need to pay for this. Do do you think higher taxes are coming? >> So, um, you know, my view, again, I you know, I was going to the kind of voluntary stuff we could do first. But, but I actually I actually do believe that. I think this one is going to be big enough that, you know, at some point I think everyone's going to come to the realization that there needs to be some kind of macroeconomic intervention there. you know, if we if we look at just the disparities in wealth that that we have now, if we look at it as a fraction of GDP, I I believe we've kind of exceeded the guilded age already. And this is mostly without without AI. So, I think things are going to go even further and and so yeah, you know, my my guess is this is this is not even going to be a partisan thing. There's a wealth there's a wealth tax now in California. Are you are you supportive of that? >> No, I think that's I think that's poorly designed. If you're interested in AI and want a step-by-step guide walking you through it, I built the course I wish I had when I first started studying the niche. If you're interested, you can get lifetime access in the description below and the price will be going up as we add new modules. Back to the video. Anthropic built their own economic tracking system because government data moves too slowly to capture what AI is actually doing to jobs. So, think about how the government measures employment. The Bureau of Labor Statistic does surveys, compiles data, releases reports, and by the time you're reading those numbers, they're already months old. That system was designed for an economy that changed gradually. A factory closes, unemployment ticks up in that region, the data captures it 6 months later. Policy makers respond. That feedback loop worked fine when transformations happen over years. Anthropic has something different. They can see in real time which industries are using Claude, which specific tasks people are delegating versus augmenting, how that's shifting week to week. Daria mentioned that they can even break it down by state, by subtask within industries. That's a level of granularity the government just doesn't have, and most importantly, it's current. They're watching the economic diffusion happen live. The distinction Darian makes between augmentation and delegation is really important. Augmentation means that you're using AI as a tool. It makes you faster, but you're still doing the work. Delegation means the AI is doing the task and you're just checking the output. Or maybe not even that. Those two patterns have completely different implications for employment. And right now, you don't have good enough data on which one is winning. Anthropic is trying to figure that out. I think the bigger point here is actually about policy. Dario's argument is pretty simple. You can't make good decisions without good data. And if data you have is 6 months old and too broad to capture what's actually happening, you're flying blind. So Anthropic build their own system. Whether the government actually developed something similar or whether this becomes a model other companies follow, I don't know. But the fact that a private AI company felt the need to build this tells you something about the gap between how fast AI moves and how fast our measurement systems move. Finally, got a fascinating clip from Bill Gates. Check this out. The Gates Foundation announcing it's teaming up with OpenAI to use its models in Africa to expand access to healthcare. Earlier, I spoke with Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and started out by asking him how this partnership came about. There's a great ongoing conversation uh with Sam and the whole team at OpenAI about uh the way they want to improve the world and how their AI can be used even in poor countries uh for issues like health and education. And so uh we decided you know to provide all the computer time and uh to support a pilot uh in a thousand health clinics in Africa starting with Rwanda. >> So what does it what does it actually look like in practice? >> Well, you as a patient will uh talk in your native language uh to the AI about your symptoms. Uh you'll schedule your appointment uh through the AI. when you come in, instead of doing paperwork, the doctor or the clinician, usually it's not a doctor, will see that summary. Uh they won't have to fill out paperwork like they've had in the past. So the idea is to make the quality of that encounter far higher, the waiting uh far shorter uh and to take the very constrained resources uh that these countries have and and have far better healthcare. And how did you decide I know Microsoft has a partnership of course with open ad but how did you decide to do it with open AI as opposed to we just talked to Deis from uh Deep Minds or Anthropic or one of the other models. >> Yeah. So the you'll see the Gates Foundation working with Anthropic and Google and Microsoft and OpenAI. We have uh major things that we'll do with each of them. Uh OpenAI jumped up and was super generous on this. Of course, they have a foundation that owns a significant amount of their company, right? >> You know, the value in that foundation actually rivals uh the world's biggest foundation, the Gates Foundation. And so uh they'll often in terms of their capacity to donate be a be a great partner. >> By the way, what do you think of that? The fact that OpenAI will ultimately given the ownership structure be perhaps the largest foundation in the world. >> You know, it'll depend on how much uh the the value goes up, right? uh over time. But I I think that's incredible. I wish, you know, 25% of lots of uh uh great companies was going to go to the poorest in the world. You know, essentially my ownership of Microsoft indirectly uh has done a >> YouTube isn't just entertainment. It's one of the best client acquisition tools because it builds trust at scale.
