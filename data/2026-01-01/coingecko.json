        "transcript": "Have you ever tried using your crypto to actually buy or pay for something like food, flights, or Netflix? [music] It can be a hassle sometimes to have to cash out before being able to spend. I'll be going over exactly how to [music] skip that in this video because while most places don't take crypto directly, [music] an easy workaround is through crypto gift card platforms. Okay, let's kick things off with Bit [music] Refill. probably the most well-known name when it comes to crypto gift cards. They've been doing this since 2014 and are available in over 180 countries. The brand list depends on where you are, but you'll find all the familiar names like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Walmart, Uber, and the rest. You can pay with pretty much every popular coin, Bitcoin, Ethereum, Soul, USDT, USDC, and also even Doge. They also support Bitcoin over Lightning, which is great if you want faster confirmations or lower fees. And if you're using stable coins, you've got options across different chains. So you can send USCT or USDC on Ethereum, Arbitum, or [music] SUI depending on where you have it or what's cheaper at the time. Now, one of the nice things about Bit Refill is that you don't even need an account to use it. You just [music] pick a card, enter your email, pay in crypto, and it gets sent straight to your inbox. [music] Now, if you do go the anonymous route, however, there are some limits up to 15 orders a day, $500 max per day, and 1,000 per month. To spend more, you'll need to go through KYC, which includes a selfie, your ID, and proof of address. Now, if you do make an account, there are a few extra perks. For one, you can preload crypto into your Bit Refill balance so that you're not signing a new transaction every time that you check out. Plus, you get to enjoy cash back on some cards. Now, let's talk about CoinsB, which has been around since 2019 and works in over 185 countries. The flow is pretty similar to Bit Refills. No account needed. Just choose a product, pay, and the gift card lands in your inbox. And they also accept a ton of coins. Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, USDT, USDC, BNB, and more. You can also pay through apps like Binance Pay, Crypto.com Pay, or Gate Pay, which if you're already using one of these, is super convenient. The selection is also pretty decent with over 5,000 brands covering everything from mobile topups to gaming credits and global brands like Amazon, Steam, Netflix, and Apple. As for limits, you can make one-off purchases up to €1,000 without an account. And unless you're spending over €10,000 total, there's no KYC required. All right, so that's Coinsby. But if you're based in the US or Canada, Coin Cards is another solid option. They've been around since 2014, starting out in Canada, and now they've expanded to the US and [music] parts of Europe as well. Now, as for what you can buy, it's the usual names like Amazon, Walmart, Uber, Apple, and more, but availability depends on your region. If you're in Canada, you'll likely get the broadest selection since that's where they started. Coin Cards keeps things a bit [music] more focused when it comes to payment. You've got Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, and Lightning if you're trying to keep it fast and cheap. As for spending limits, it depends on where you're based. In the US, it's up to $2,000 a day. In the UK, it's closer to $5,000, and other countries are in the same general range, give or take. And rounding out the list, we've got crypto refills, which has been around since 2018, and like the others, is available in over 180 countries. The setup is pretty similar. You pick what you want, you pay with crypto, and you get the gift card by email. But if you do create an account, there's a reward system called Crypto Refills points. You earn these points on certain purchases and once you rack up enough, you can convert them back into crypto. They support popular coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USCT, which you can send directly from your wallet or through services like Coin Pay or Coinbase Pay if that's more convenient. Now, the selection also covers most of the big names, Amazon, Uber, Apple, Netflix, and so on. As for limits, if you're checking out without an account, you can spend up to around €4,000 a day and 5,000 a month. But if you're verified, that monthly cap goes up to €30,000. Now, before we wrap up, it's worth mentioning that a few brands do accept crypto directly, usually through web 3 payment processors. It's a bit hit or miss though. Microsoft, AT&T, and even Tesla have supported it at different times. Shopify also lets merchants accept crypto if they choose to enable it. And McDonald's >> McDonald's in Switzerland accepts Bitcoin >> has had some integration going for a while as well. But in most cases, gift cards are still the easiest and also most reliable way to spend crypto, especially if your go-to brand doesn't accept it yet. So, let us know in the comments where you're actually using crypto in your dayto-day."
