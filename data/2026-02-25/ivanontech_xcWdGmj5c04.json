    "transcript": "Oh  yes.  Oh  yes.  So  yes  guys,  welcome  to   another  episode.  And  as  you  can  see   right  now,  Bitcoin  is  still  at  around  65   62  63.  It  is  going  up  and  down  here  and   there  every  day.  But  what  is  important   guys  is  that  we  may  have  a  bit  of  a   major  news  because  you  remember  that   yesterday  we  discussed  the  Jane  Street,   the  fact  that  Jane  Street,  which  is  a   big  Wall  Street  firm,  and  they  have  been   sued  by  Terara,  the  Terra  Luna  collapse   project.  And  Teral  Luna  basically   accuses  them  of  causing  the  crypto22   winter  by  manipulating  the  USDT  stable   coin  which  collapsed  and  basically   pushing  Terra  Luna  to  zero  to  zero.  And   now  many  people  are  are  speculating,   hey,  why  is  it  so  that  for  the  first   time  in  two  months  a  full  day  of  Bitcoin   trading  happened  without  a  motivated   seller  taking  out  the  entire  bid  stack   in  one  trade  to  crush  the  momentum.  So   the  speculation  is  of  course  that  the   reason  for  this  is  that  as  soon  as  Jane   Street  appears  in  the  news  the  daily   Bitcoin  selling  stops  and  many  people   are  wondering  is  this  the  end  of  the   selling?  Is  this  the  end  of  the  barrier?   Is  this  the  end  of  the  dumping?  Every   day  we  wake  up  there's  a  dump  there's  a   bit  of  a  pump  and  then  there's  another   dump  and  every  day  have  just  perpetual   dumping  and  dumping  and  dumping  and   dumping.  People  are  asking  Ivan  does   this  mean  we  go  up  from  here?  Does  this   mean  that  the  biggest  bear  has  now  been   slain?  And  listen  guys,  we  have  to  look   at  the  facts.  Looking  at  what  act  what   actually  is  happening  is  just  intraday   volatility.  But  people  are  so  excited.   People  are  so  excited  that  now  the  the   bar  is  over.  In  fact,  we  are  lower  than   last  week  and  it's  just  Wednesday  and   yeah,  already  now  we're  lower  than  last   week.  We're  lower  than  the  week  before   that.  We're  lower  than  the  week  before   that.  So  all  in  all,  the  trend  is  still   mega  mega  mega  bare.  Normally  it  doesn't   work  like  that.  One  single  firm  is   pushing  down  the  entire  market.  Even  if   you  have  one  single  firm  doing  manu   manipulation,  they're  trying  to  get  the   market  down.  In  Bitcoin,  it  is  quite   tough.  In  altcoins,  it  wouldn't  surprise   me  at  all  in  smaller  markets.  But  in   Bitcoin  to  really  be  able  to  manipulate   the  price  down  and  to  be  able  to  hold  it   down  for  months  and  months  and  months   and  months.  I  don't  think  that  happens.   It's  just  impractical.  Unpractical  say   non-practical.  Impractical.  Unpractical.   You  get  all  of  the  versions.  Uh  and  also   what's  the  point?  Because  if  you  want  to   manipulate  something,  all  coins  is  where   you  would  go.  It  is  lower  liquidity.  A   lot  of  them  still  have  to  dump  a  lot.   Okay?  And  so  if  you  want  to  start  some   kind  of  liquidation  cascade,  that's  the   place  to  be.  Bitcoin  is  too  big  of  a   market  and  also  the  reward  for   manipulating  it  is  very  risky.  It's  it's   too  risky.  The  riskreward  simply  does   not  make  sense.  And  let's  say  you  are   manipulating  to  the  downside.  Someone   may  come  in  and  start  manipulating  to   the  upside  and  wreck  you.  I  mean  it's  a   dog  eat  dog  world  when  it  comes  to   trading.  Even  the  biggest  institutions   can  get  wrecked  if  the  market  goes   against  them.  If  they  if  let's  say  you   try  to  push  the  price  down  because  you   have  a  big  fat  short,  you  want  to  create   some  kind  of  liquidation  cascade.  Well,   someone  may  come  and  push  the  price  up   because  they  they  want  to  manipulate  to   the  other  direction.  Okay.  Uh  so  this  is   basically  what's  happening  and  uh  my   conclusion  here  is  that  our  strategy  our   trajectory  doesn't  really  change  and  in   fact  we  are  due  for  some  kind  of  relief   rally  for  a  long  time  but  especially  if   you  look  at  the  performance  yearbyear   and  you  look  at  the  midterm  years  you   remember  that  we  discussed  this   yesterday.  We  are  actually  due  for  a   bounce.  Just  looking  at  the  past  midterm   years,  looking  at  where  we  are  now  and  u   the  year  this  far,  you  see  the  white   line  which  is  the  average  of  all  of   them.  It  should  give  us  some  kind  of   relief  rally.  I  mean  basically  now.   Okay,  basically  now  if  you  look  at  the   average  the  average  the  white  line  is   the  average  of  the  midterm  year.  It   should  be  now.  It  will  not  be  a  long  uh   rally.  It's  basically  going  to  be  let's   see  from  56  to  day  6.  It's  like  a  week.   Okay,  a  week  of  rally  potentially  can   happen.  Is  it  guaranteed?  It's  not   guaranteed  because  it's  it's  an  average   of  previous  midterm  years.  And  can  we   trust  this  with  100%  of  our  capital?  Of   course  not.  But  at  the  same  time,  you   see  the  the  similarity.  The  similarity   is  insane.  It's  it's  quite  insane.  Uh  at   some  point  it's  going  to  deviate  a  bit.   I  mean,  here  the  purple  year  2022   deviated  a  lot  from  previous  midterm   years,  but  then  it  got  pulled  back  into   the  into  the  average.  And  here  you  had   the  yellow  one  which  is  2014  deviating  a   lot  from  pre  previous  midterm  years  but   then  it  also  got  pulled  back  into  the   average  and  all  of  them  basically  end   somewhere  between  58  to  70%  down  on   average.  So  let's  see  how  the  green  year   current  2026  green  chart  here  how  this   green  year  ends.  But  um  all  in  all  uh  if   you  see  a  week  of  um  pump  you  know   what's  happening.  you  know  what's   happening  and  if  we  look  at  our   community  shorters  are  eating  today   again  if  I  look  at  the  summary  Jacobos   has  shorted  the  apptos  fantastic   fantastic  27%  by  the  way  I  see  Kagi  in   the  chat  where's  Kagi  I  I  have  I  have   your  trade  here  Kagi  mechanical  rules   another  2K  so  Kagi  from  YouTube  gaming   YouTube  is  using  the  mechanical  rules  in   our  Bullmania  discord  learning  deploying   fantastic  to  see  fantastic  how  is  your   short  kagi  it's  still  alive  what's   happening   Capture  it  before  it  disappears.

Also  pool  cleaner   shorting  Bitcoin  10x.  And  also  I  had  a   nice  message  here  I  want  to  share  with   you.  Here  here.  Rudok.  Rudok.  This  a  new   member  because  he  has  a  green  leaf.  It   means  he's  new.  He  says,  \"Hi,  new  here.   close  first  to  trades  using  the  uh  money   line  strategy  mechanical  rules  focused   focusing  on  changing  bad  habits  have   accured  over  many  many  years  rather  than   chasing  big  numbers  the  big  numbers  will   come  I  will  I  need  consistency  first   exactly  I  mean  that's  what  we  teach  when   you  come  into  bulmania  the  first  step  is   to  remove  your  sick  ideas  about  what   trading  is  because  most  people  I  don't   exaggerate  they  have  sick  ideas   perverted  ideas  what  trading  is  uh   because  they've  been  listening  to  wrong   information  for  years  so  it  takes  like   if  you  wish  just  to  reprogram  in  your   brain  to  understand  what  hell  trading   is.  So  you  you  stop  hurting  yourself.   Okay?  After  years  and  years  and  years  of   doing  bad  decisions,  you  don't  even  know   what's  what  good  is.  When  I  tell  you   what  good  is,  you  tell  me  I  don't   understand  the  fundamentals.  I  don't   understand  fundamentals.  Something  like   that.  Okay.  Passive  in  passive.   Yesterday  was  a  good  day.  Fantastic.   Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Whoa.  Whoa.  Look,   you're  shorting  soul.  And  by  the  way,   about  the  soul  short,  we  have  to   understand  that  we  are  kind  of  halfway   to  the  30  target.  Why?  Because  you   remember  we  start  to  speak  about  30  when   um  Sulana  was  115.  It  was  kind  of  here.   It  was  kind  of  breaking  this  uh  and  I   think  it  was  115.  So  now  we're  down  how   much?  30%.  And  to  go  to  30,  we  need  to   go  75%.  So  we're  almost  halfway  there.   Okay.  I  know  when  I  said  that  Tulana  can   go  to  30  here  at  115,  people  said,   \"You're  crazy,  Ivan.  You're  crazy.  You   don't  understand  the  fundamental.  You're   crazy,  bro.  I'm  the  sole  fundamental   guy.  I  mean,  I  I  know  Solana   fundamentals  better  than  anyone,  but   still,  we  look  at  the  chart  and  now   we're  kind  of  halfway  there.  Yeah.  Isn't   that  crazy?  Confirm  in  the  comment   section  if  you  think  that's  crazy   because  I  mean,  that  is  crazy.  Okay,   that  is  crazy.  Will  30  happen?  Who  the   hell  knows?  But  that's  the  target.   That's  the  target.  Maybe  we  bottom  out  a   bit  earlier.  Who  the  hell  knows?  But  is   the  target  is  the  magnet.  It's  going  to   get  magnetized  here  more  and  more  and   more  and  more.  And  the  question  is,  of   course,  where  do  you  trade?  Go  to   bullmania.com/partners   or  exchanges  I  use  in  the  description.   It  says  exchanges  I  use  and  then  you   click  the  link.  You're  gonna  go  to  buy   bit.

Very,  very  nice.  Welcome,   welcome,  welcome  everyone.  Guys,  also   the  overall  crypto  market  cap  is  in  a   falling  knife  formation.  Um  falling   knife  formation  is  somewhere  where  you   don't  really  want  to  bet  on  any  kind  of   reversal.  You  don't  want  to  be  front   running  a  falling  knife  in  general.  In   general,  even  if  you  think  that  it's   irrational,  even  if  you  think  that  the   market  is  wrong,  even  if  you  think  that   the  market  is  oversold,  it  can  get  even   more  oversold.  So  this  kind  of  chart,   you  don't  want  to  long  it  even  if  it   looks  like  it's  kind  of  a  Jew  for  a   bounce.  Okay?  And  maybe  it  will  bounce,   but  we  we  wait  for  the  confirmed  trend.   Very  important.  We  need  to  wait  for  the   confirmed  trend  because  a  falling  knife   can  stay  a  falling  knife  for  a  long   time,  like  super  long  time.  And  uh  it   may  be  rational  but  you  know  the  saying   market  can  stay  irrational  longer  than   you  can  stay  liquid  and  uh  then  when  it   reverses  you  have  no  money  and  that's   very  important  uh  to  to  keep  in  mind.   Let's  check  something  that  I  wanted  to   share  with  you  in  terms  of  liquidity   guys  because  if  we  go  to  tether  and  you   remember  that  tether  it's  very  important   to  look  at  from  a  market  cap  perspective   when  market  cap  is  growing  it  means  it   is  bull  market.  When  they  say  we  just   printed  another  billion,  we  just  printed   another  billion,  we  just  printed  another   billion,  it  means  that  we're  going  to   pump.  We're  going  to  pump.  Okay,   normally  we  pump.  The  problem  here  is  is   that  since  the  beginning  of  the  year,   the  market  cap  of  Tether  is  shrinking.   If  I  look  at  one  year,  you  see  here,   boop,  rolling  over.  And  let's  actually   see  how  it  looked  like  in  the  last  uh   bare  market.  Uh  you  know  that  bare   market  starts  somewhere  here  in  November   2021.  Here  is  where  Bitcoin  topped  out   and  started  to  go  down.  And  the  same   date  here  at  this  cycle  is  somewhere   here  on  October  the  7th  or  so.  And  we   said  to  the risk  on  October  the  8th  just   as  a  humble  reminder.  Uh  and  so   basically  yeah  uh  all  markets  all  bull   markets  stop  out  a  bit  before  the  peak   in  the  in  the  tether  market  cap  and  then   here  it  fell  off  a  cliff  approximately  6   months  later  basically  in  the  middle  of   the  uh  of  the  year  of  the  midterm  year.   2022  was  the  midterm  year  and  then  it   found  a  bottom  in  Q4  and  then  we  start   to  print  again.  Uh  we  need  to  see   something  similar.  I  mean,  we  need  to   start  printing  again,  that's  for  sure.   But  you  you  can  monitor  here  a  bit  when   it  bottoms  out.  It's  one  of  the  signals   that  we  can  use  to  be  certain  that  our   big  fat  longs,  which  will  happen  uh  when   Bitcoin  goes  into  bull  trend,  likely   going  to  be  later  this  year,  that   they're  correct.  We're  not  going  to  be   trading  purely  based  on  this.  This  is   just  a  confirmation  signal  once  the   chart  has  turned,  but  uh  it  is  an   instant  confir  confirmation  signal   nonetheless.  Um  obviously  now  you  also   have  USDC.  Let  me  check  USDC.  I  didn't   check  this  one.  And  if  we  go  to  market   cap,  we  see  a  similar  situation  here.   Very  similar.  It  did  pick  out  and  now   we're  going  down.  So  at  some  point  this   thing  will  bottom  out  and  at  some  point   it's  going  to  go  up  again.  And  here  is   where  we  will  be  bidding,  bidding,   bidding  like  there  is  no  tomorrow.  And   that's  the  uh  benefit  uh  you  have  if   you've  been  following  the  channel  and   you  have  been  following  sound  trading   practices,  not  just  this,  you  know,   [ __ ]  to  hold  to  zero  diamond  diamond.   uh  you've  been  following  sound  trading   practices,  derisking  when  the  trend  is   bearish,  uh  being  risk  off  when  the  tide   is  shifting  to  the  bears  because  then   you  have  the  opportunity  to  act  when   it's  time  to  be  bullish.  If  you  are  not   following  sound  trading  practices,  you   are  just  uh  disrespecting  your  money  by   listening  to  someone  that  tells  you  to   buy  the  dip  endlessly  and  you  have  some   false  belief  about  your  coin  that  is   going  to  do  some  crazy  things  while  it   just  keeps  going  down  and  down  and  down   and  down.  you  don't  have  that   opportunity.  Of  course,  you  can  always   get  a  bit  more  money  by  working  double   job,  triple  job.  You  can  always  create   more  income.  But  if  you  really  want  to   improve,  you  need  to  review  what  has   happened  during  the  last  year  and  be   very  honest  with  yourself.  Do  you  want   to  repeat  the  same  thing  next  cycle?  Do   you  want  to  be  in  the  same  position  in   future  markets  as  well?  Maybe  not  even   crypto.  I  mean,  stock  market,  AI,   everything  that  trades  follows  a  similar   pattern.  Big  trend  up,  trend  down.  Big   trend  up,  trend  down.  And  when  you're   bearish  in  a  bare  trend,  it  doesn't  mean   that  you  hate  the  asset.  I  mean,  these   assets,  crypto,  we  love  the  crypto   assets.  We  love  them.  At  the  same  time,   I  don't  want  to  huddle  them  down.  I  want   to  be  buying  when  the  when  the  bull   trend  starts.  And  uh  that's  something   you  have  to  understand.  Exactly.  You   cannot  be  full  masochist   maybe  or  full  massochist.  That's  one  of   the  sick  perverted  ideas  we  have  to   change  when  people  come  into  bull  mania.   This  is  an  example.  They  just  hodddle   and  huddle  and  somehow  you  become  worthy   of  a  pump  because  you  hodddled  minus  90%   and  now  you're  like  more  worthy  than   everyone  else.  It  is  perverted  and  sick   because  you  understand  that  once  the   bull  shift  happens,  anyone  can  buy  it  at   the  lows  and  you're  down  99%  and  the  new   traders  can  come  in  and  buy  at  the  lows   and  they're  going  to  be  dumping,  you   know,  way  before  the  price  recovers   fully.  Like  you're  going  to  have  so  much   new  sell  pressure  because  the  new   players  come  in,  they  have  massive   profit,  they  dump,  but  because  you  need   to  pump  like  a,000  eggs  to  break  even.   You  understand?  That's  a  problem.  Anyway   guys,  go  to  bullmayer.com.  Learn  the   mechanical  rules.  Like  if  this  really   resonates  with  you,  you  need  to  take   action.  Some  people  they  hear  me  say  it   uh  day  in  and  day  out.  They  never  take   action.  So  they  feel  that  they  they   understand,  but  they  they  really  don't.   So  if  you  don't  go  to  booming  at  home,   you  watch  the  video  properly,  you   understand  what  else  is  happening.  You   you  don't  join  booming,  you  don't  have   our  tools,  you  don't  have  the  education,   you're  just  um  you  know,  it's  like   mental  masturbation.  You  know,  you  kind   of  you  you  feel  that  you  know,  but   without  knowing  it,  you  don't.  It's  like   you  I  tell  you  how  to  ride  a  bike,  but   without  you  riding  a  bike,  you  don't   know  how  to  ride  the  bike.  You  don't   know.  You  may  feel  like  you  know,  you   don't  you  don't  know  anything.  You  don't   know  anything.   Big  shout  out.  Big  shout  out,  guys.   That's  that.  Uh  next,  what's  happening?   Uh  we  we  discussed  this  Jane  Street   situation.  We  discussed  the  falling   knife  situation.  So,  yeah,  we  we  need  to   wait  for  the  uh  for  the  shift  to  happen.   We  have  some  news  about  Stripe.  Stripe   is  apparently  considering  buying  PayPal.   I  think  that  would  be  fantastic  because   PayPal  is  such  a  bad  service  now.  Super   high  fee.  I  mean,  literally,  I  think   it's  up  to  10%  fee  on  PayPal  with  the   currency  conversion,  with  the  withdrawal   fee.  Also,  their  API  is  so  bad.  Is  the   worst  API  in  the  world.  The  the  full   website  is  uh  is  laggy  and  buggy  as   hell.  Sometimes  I  try  to  log  in,  it  says   that  we're  not  sure  it's  you.  Okay.   Well,  what  do  you  mean  you're  And   there's  nothing  to  do.  Like,  I  don't   know  if  you've  had  that.  I  think  it's   mainly  the  merchant  accounts  like  if  you   try  to  sell  something  via  PayPal   sometimes  it  just  says  we're  not  sure   it's  you  or  actually  no  no  it's  not  on   it  also  happened  in  my  personal  one  it's   like  we're  not  sure  it's  but  okay  what   do  you  want  me  do  you  want  pass  password   do  you  want  SMS  do  you  want  authent  like   tell  me  what  no  nothing  to  do  there's   nothing  we  we're  just  not  sure  it's  you   okay  then  you  try  to  connect  PayPal  to   some  accounting  software  or  whatever  all   API  is  very  uh  very  very  messed  up  that   that's  some  masochism.  Okay,  so  we  don't   use  PayPal  for  like  five  plus  years  or   something  like  that.  It's  very  bad.   Maybe  if  Stripe  buys  the  buys  this  uh   piling  steaming  uh  POS,  maybe  it's  going   to  be  good.  Maybe  it's  going  to  be  good.   Uh  and  POSOS  is  not  point  of  sale  in   this  uh  in  this  context.  You  know  what   it  is.  So  yeah,  let's  see  next.  uh  CEO   of  Coinbase,  Brian,  pushes  back  on  UK   stable  coin  caps  as  stock  and  profit   search.  This  is  very  important,  guys.  In   the  UK,  uh  I  don't  know,  you're  like   cattle  or  something.  I  mean,  you  you're   your your  whole  life  is  being  decided  by   some  third  party  which  calls  themselves   the  government  and  um  soon  you  will  not   be  able  to  hold  more  than  a  few  thousand   in  stable  coin,  guys.  Okay?  And  then   they  tax  you  even  more  and  then  they   make  your  communities  unsafe  and  so  on   so  forth  and  they  just  give  you  like   more  rules  and  more  rules  and  more  rules   for  what  man.  I  mean  for  what?  For  what?   For  what?  Look  here.  Stable  coin  rules   in  the  UK  are  being  finalized  and  we  are   at  risk  of  preventing  the  UK  from  being   globally  competitive  in  the  digital   economy.  I  mean  good  riddance.  Do  you   say  that  or  do  you  say  god  riddens?  Good   riddance.  I  mean  go  to  zero,  you  know,   become  third  world,  remove  yourself  from   all  of  the  finance.  Actually,  I  don't   see  any  issue  here.  Let  let  them  do  what   they  want.  I  mean,  at  some  point,  you   you  got  to  figure  it  out.  You  got  to  hit   rock  bottom  before  you  understand  that   things  need  to  change.  Okay?  Uh  without   hitting  rock  bottom,  they  don't   understand.  For  example,  the  Bank  of   England  is  proposing  a  cap  on  stable   holdings  for  individuals  and  businesses.   Why  the  hell  they  should  decide  anything   like  that  is  uh  beyond  me,  but  uh  okay.   The  UK  has  a  long  history  of  being  a   financial  hub.  Embracing  and  encouraging   innovation.  No,  no,  no.  I  I  I  don't  know   what  you're  speaking  about.  Especially   when  other  countries  are  moving  fast   here.  It's  important  for  maintaining   that.  If  you're  from  the  UK,  you  can   sign  petition  to  Yeah.  I  mean,  guys,   petition.  You  can  sign  petition.  Do  you   think  they  care?  Do  you  think  they  care?   It's  uh  quite  interesting  what  happened   in  the  famous  fi  files  on  the  famous   island.  Like  all  the  politicians,  they   are  they  are  friends  like  left,  right,   this  and  that.  I  don't  think  anyone   cares  what  any  what  what  the  average   average  player  thinks.  Okay,  you  go  you   you  sign  petition.  Who's  going  to  read   it?  You  think  anyone's  going  to  read  it?   You  think  anyone  like  the  big  bankers,   they  have  a  big  business,  global   business.  You  think  they're  going  to   change  their  stance  on  crypto  and  the   fact  that  uh  you  know  you  want  your   crypto  stable  coins  in  your  wallet.   Meanwhile,  their  big  bank  business  is  at   risk.  You  think  they're  gonna  read  a   petition?   You  think  they're  gonna  Oh,  oh  crap.   2,000  crypto  guys  have  a  petition  here.   like  let's  let's  not  let's  not  try  to   capture  crypto  then.  Ah,  okay  guys,  you   have  a  petition  that  changes  things.   Instead,   instead  the  result  is  going  to  be  that   real  cryptos,  no  stable  coins,  but  real   cryptos,  Bitcoin,  ETH,  Solana,  they're   just  going  to  search  more  in  the  UK.   Okay?  Because  people  want   permissionless.  They  want  to  have  money   in  their  own  wallet  because  whatever  the   bank  banks  have,  the  problem  is  still   going  to  be  that  it  can  be  frozen  at  any   time.  uh  you  do  a  transaction  which  is  a   bit  big  amount  you  buy  a  bicycle  you   know  currently  in  the  UK  if  you  even  buy   a  bicycle  it's  a  few  hundred  pound  or   whatever  you're  kind  of  a  terrorist  okay   you  may  be  like  you  may  be  they  don't   know  they  have  to  check  that's  that's   that's  the  problem  they  they  need  to   check  they  need  to  double  check  so   you're  not  okay  because  it's  a  big   amount  and  then  you  and  and  here  is  the   the  worst  thing  in  the  UK  but  also   across  Europe  like  we  discussed   yesterday  I  I  mean  the  people  I  I  really   feel  sorry  for  them  because  you  are   entering  the  highest  tax  bracket  at  like   5k  pounds  like  4k  4k  euros  you're  easily   like  in  the  almost  like  the  top  top  top   maybe  not  the  super  top  but  like  you   you're  you're  seen  as  the  top  top  top   like  4k  dollars  man  like  you  cannot  buy   too  much  with  it  in  the  go  to  London  go   to  any  big  city  in  Europe  try  to  get  a   nice  apartment  for  4k  5k  uh  your  whole   your  whole  account  is  going  to  go  there   okay  uh  I  mean  in  a  big  city  you  can   easily  pay  2  3k  for  a  nice  uh  place.   Okay.  So,  you  basically  have  to  live  in   some  kind  of  shoe  box.  Okay.  And  then   you  have  a  family,  everyone  is  in  shoe   box  and  you  are  seen  by  the  government,   by  the  media,  by  the  television  as  creme   de  la  creme,  top  of  the  society.  So,  oh   yeah  yeah yeah  guys.  This  petition  will   not  help.  You  need  to  uh  number  one  you   need  to  understand  how  to  trade  so  you   can  be  worldwide.  So  you  don't  have  to   be  in  one  particular  country  like  the   UK.  But  number  two,  uh  long-term  I  think   it's  actually  good  for  for  real  cryptos.   Okay,  you  can  you  cannot  have  stable   coins,  have  Solana,  have  Solana,  have   some  ETH,  have  have  Bitcoin.  Okay,  so   long-term  I  think  even  it's  a  bit  good   for  for  real  crypto.  So  maybe  I'm  even   in  support  of  this  cap  to  be  fair.  Uh  I   mean  these  guys  UK,  they're  going  to  go   to  zero  anyway.  So  let  I'm  actually  a   bit  in  support  of  this.  Push  people  to   real  cryptos.  Exactly.  Why  have  stable   coins  compete  for  uh  for  uh  your  your   funds?  Better  that  you  put  them  in   Bitcoin.  Now  guys,  I  have  to  show  you   also  something  else  in  Germany.  Well,   we're  speaking  about  Europe.  I  don't   know  if  it's  true.  You  guys  let  me  know   from  Germany,  but  apparently  apparently   a  guy  in  Germany  said  that  Friedish   Mertz  is  Pinocchio  because  he's  lying   and  he's  now  getting  sued  by  by  Fredish   Mertz.  Is  that  correct?  3  months  later,   he  was  informed  he's  being  investigated   under  the  German  criminal  code  in  2021   law  that  criminalizes  insults  against   politicians  if  deemed  harmful  to  their   public  work,  carrying  penalties  of  up  to   5  years  in  prison.  Holy  crap.  I  mean,   guys,  if  you're  in  Germany,  what  what's   going  on  here?  Pinocchio.  So,  the  guy   wrote,  \"According  to  this  post,  guys,   I'm  not  saying  anything.  And  to  be   clear,  I'm  not  calling  anyone  Pinocchio.   I  am  in  the  clear.  I'm  in  the  clear.  I'm   not  calling  the  guy  Pinocchio.  Okay.   But  this  guy  that  uh  is  being  written   about,  he  said  that  Pinocchio  is  coming   to  HN.  I  guess  this  is  his  town.  Like  in   letters  for  his  town  and  like  this  guy   is  saying  in  Germany  you  can  go  to  jail   for  calling  a  politician  a  liar.  This  um   is  meant  to  demoralize  the  people.  Okay,   let's  see  guys.  Let's  see  what's   happening.  But  uh  yeah,  if  it's  I  don't   know if  it's  true.  Is  it  true?  If  you're   a  German,  let  us  know.  Let  us  know  in   the  comment  section  if  it's  true  or  not.   But  you  see,  we  need  more  tools.  We  need   more  more  technologies  to  be  outside  of   the  mental  hospital  because  the  mental   hospital  becomes  worse  and  worse  and   worse  as  you  can  see.  As  you  can  see  Oh,   by  the  way,  Kagi,  Kagi,  Kagi,  you're   here.  I  want  to  check  with  you  if  this   is  web  3  gaming.  Is  this  good  gameplay?   Wait,  wait,  wait.

I  mean,  obviously  there   there  are  gaming  wallets  that  do  it   internally,  but  yeah,  uh  it's  uh  it's   bare  market,  so  we  can  joke  about  this   industry.  In  the  bull  market,  we're   bullish  and  we're  bullish.  Guys,  let's   go  to  Q&A  questions.  Answer  the  base   discussions.  I  have  approximately  15   minutes  to  go.  So,  let's  go  as  soon  as   possible.   It's  even  worse.  German  politics   according  to  alltime  high  KO  user  in  the   chat  guys  I  don't  want  to  say  anything   so  I'm  just  saying  that  it's  you  that   said  it  okay  you  said  it  okay  I  didn't   say  but  he  this  guy  in  the  chat  is   saying  German  politics  did  a  law  that   reduces  taxes  for  logistic  companies  but   only  for  DHL  the  biggest  small  stable   companies  die  already  yeah  exactly   exactly  so  if  you  have  a  business  you're   kind  of  there  they  don't  like  you  if  you   have  a  business  it's  a  big  problem  you   have  a  business  you  like  you  have  your   own  money  they  don't  like  it  they  want   you  to  to  get  money  from  government.   Okay.  Do  you  if  you  have  your  you  have   too  much  free,  you  know,  free  free   thought.  You  may  you  think  about   something,  you  shouldn't  think  too  much.   I  mean  that  that's  how  I  would  like  it.   If  I  would  be  a  a  socialist,  I  don't   want  you  to  make  your  own  money.  You   should  be  dependent  on  the  state.  If  you   have  your  business,  I'm  going  to  tax  it   to  death.  So  you  come  for  come  to  me  for   benefit.  Come  to  me.  Come  to  me.  Don't   try  to  create  your  own.  You  come  to  me.   We're  going  to  be  best  friends.  I  will   give  you  benefit.  unemployment  benefit   uh  if  you  are  very  good  and  you  you   don't  think  too  much  maybe  I  give  you   apartment  even  so  you  can  bring  more   people  maybe  your  family  so  we  give  you   all  apartment  you  vote  for  me  you  vote   if  you  have  money  I  don't  like  you  why   because  again  you  you  you  think  you  you   are  better  or  something  you  think  you   maybe  you  get  some  ideas  so  let  me  take   your  money  I  give  it  I  give  it  to  these   guys  man  I  would  be  the  best  socialist   in  the  world  I  would  I  would  have  this   watch  still  because  it's  always  like   that  the  socialist  That's  the  biggest   one.   Socialistic  government.  We  would  have   like  even  more  like  bigger  chain.  I   would  have  big  fat  gold  chain.  Fully   socialist,  fully  solidaric,  fully  for   the  working  class.   I  love  it. I  love  I  love  it.  It's  going   to  be  great.   I  would  be  richer  than  the  richest   businessman.  Why?  Because  I'm   socialistic  politician.   It's  classic.  It's  classic,  guys.  It's   classic,  guys.  And  the  Westerners.  The   westerners  they  are  too  dumb  to   understand  this.  They're  like,  \"Oh,  no.   But  solidarity.\"  They  like,  \"No,  the   cars,  the  cars,  the  cars  in  the  west.   Oh,  no.  It's  so  great.\"  So,  solidarity   guys.  I  mean,  we  from  Eastern  Europe,  we   know.  We  know,  man.  We  know.  But  in  in   the  West,  it's  they  are  naive.  Oh,   they're  so  they're  naive  to  so  they're   naive  to  other  things.  They're  naive  to   so  many  things.  So  many  things.  Oh,  no.   We're  naive.  Okay.   God  rid   you  know  the  social  media.  You're  So   there  are  other  things  that  you're  naive   to  also.  You  guys  know  what  it  is.  Like   they're  they're  naive  to  everything.   They're  naive  to  everything.   Oh  yeah.  Yeah.  So  yeah,  you  you  cannot   save  the  mental  hospital.  Exactly.   Where's  our  Lambo,  guys?  I  will  have  a   Lambo  if  I  would  be  a  socialistic  um   politician.  I  would  have  the  the  biggest   one.  Okay.   People  wake  up  when  they  have  nothing   left.  Exactly.  You  have  to  hit  hit  rock   bottom.  That's  why  we  said  is  I  think   it's  better  that  they  hit  rock  bottom.   Okay.   Uh,  you're  early  going  to  restart.  Yeah,   rewatch  it.  Rewatch  it.  Re-watch  it.   Re-watch  it.   Remember  digital  land  in  sandbox?  Yeah,   those  were  the  times.  Digital  land  now   went  to  zero.  That's  why  you  got  to  be   follow  following  the  trend.  So,  it's  um   you  you're  correct.   Uh  to  call  someone  a  liar  doesn't  only   apply  for  positions  in  Germany.  You   can't  go  around  call  someone  a  liar  in   public  since  ever.   That's  very  interesting.  That's  very   very  interesting   in  Germany.  Yeah,  that's  so  th  this  is   when  I  say  that  the  US  is  the  only   country  with  true  true  free  speech.  Many   people  don't  like  they  they  don't   understand  don't  understand  what  I  mean.   This  is  one  example  where  in  the  US  with   all  of  the  issues  with  all  of  the  uh  the   the  freedom  of  speech  is  still  held  in   very  very  high  regard  extremely  high   regard.  Uh  and  um  in  Europe  there  is  no   freedom  of  speech.  I  mean  it  is  what  it   is.  There  is  no  they  may  still  call  they   may  have  a  law  that  says  maybe  freedom   of  but  you  see  yourself  there  there  is   very  little  and  where  is  the  line   freedom  of  speech  or  like  where  is  it?   But  in  Germany,  you  you  you  don't  have   to  pay  tax  on  crypto  if  you  hold  for  one   year.  I  think  it's  very  temporary,  guys.   I  think  it's  it's  gonna  it's  gonna  go   away  because  again,  I  can  tell  you  as  a   as  an  aspiring  socialistic  leader.   Okay,  that's  the  first  thing  I  would   remove.  If  I  tell  my  thousands  of  plebas   that  uh  the  crypto  millionaires  they  pay   zero  tax  and  you  guys  are  struggling   every  day.  You  guys  cannot  pay  rent  and   this  crypto  crypto  million  has  a  zero.   Oh  my  god.  We  would  have  so  much  vote.   We  would  have  so  much  vote.  We  would   have  the  biggest  vote  ever  if  we  said   that  we're  going  to  remove  it.  So  in  my   next  question  of  time  just  think  about   fundamentals  underlying  underlying   fundamentals  and  underlying  fundamentals   is  this  guys  I'm  also  telling  you  this   because  uh  the  socialism  is  going  to   grow  with  AI  people  lose  the  job  it's   it's  going  to  grow  man  it's  going  to   grow  your  your  your  Bitcoin  they're   coming  for  you  don't  think  you're   special  they're  coming  they're  they're   coming  fast  okay   they  so  much  is  going  to  get  removed   from  the  job  market  so  yeah  and  you  and   you're  there  you  think  you  smart  with   you  with  your  Bitcoin  bit  of  Bitcoin   Bitcoin  standard  like  the  central  banker   was  speaking  in  the  sorry  I  don't   understand  this  Bitcoin  standard  he   didn't  get  it  the  you  remember  the   French  banker  so  you  think  you're  there   you  know  with  your  Bitcoin  standard  you   okay  so  it's  it's  very  temporary  man   it's  very  temporary  you  got  to  look  at   the  fundamentals  of  society  what  is  in   their  brain  do  they  have  the  socialism   virus  or  no  if  they  have  it's  a  question   of   Yo,  S  Peek,  you're  the  best  island.  I'm   not  completely  wrecked  because  I  listen   to  you.  That's  good  to  hear.  Fantastic.   Fantastic.  Big  shout  out.  Big  big  shout   out.   I  wonder  if  Bit  Boy  Ben  had  to  sell  his   Crypto  Punk.   Yeah,  Crypto  Punk.  I  guess  they're  super   cheap  now.   Um,  not  haven't  followed  too  much  with   Ben.  Uh,  but  yeah,  hope  he's  okay.  He's   in  uh  jail,  mental  institution.  Where  is   he?  Someone  knows  him.   But  yeah,  he's  had  very  tough  years.   Very,  very  tough  years.  But  like  they   say,  you  got  to  find  uh  God.  Okay,  you   got  to  find  God  and  uh  get  back  to   fundamentals  uh  with  the  family,  with   everything,  you  know.  Once  you  remove   the  fundamentals  with  the  with  the  wife,   with  the  family,  like  it  is  kind  of   spirals.  Spirals.  Yeah.   He's  doing  live  stream  again.  Okay,   that's  good.  That's  good.  Yeah,  that's   good  here.  That's  good.  Here  he's  out.   Uh   are  you  real  or  AI  generated?  Still  I   have  a  joke,  guys.  Still  I  have  a  job.   I'm  not  AI  generated.  But  if  I  get  a   generator  guys,  socialist  going  to  be   the  I'm  going  to  be  voting  for  socialism   for  for  redistribution  of  of  wealth.  But   this  far  I  still  have  a  job.  So  I'm   capitalist.  I'm  capitalist.  When  I  lose   the  job,  I'm  going  socialist.  That's   that's  the  perfect  setup,  man.   Have  Have  you  guys  seen  this  flowchart?   It's  like  you  know  socialist  and  then   it's  like  an  arrow  and  arrow  is  started   his  own  business  and  then  capitalist   social  capitalist  and  then  like  is   another  arrow  where  it  says  got  audited   from  from  started  his  own  business   capitalist  then  got  audited  then   libertarian  he  goes  from  capitalist  to   libertarian  because  he  got  audited  by   the  government  his  business  or  something   then  he  got  robbed  there's  there's  an   arrow  he  got  robbed  then  back  to  like   socialism  for  for  yeah  more  protection   or  whatever   So  it's  like  socialist,  capitalist,   libertarian,  the  the  communism.  It   depends  on  your  life  journey  exactly   where  you  are.   Ben  lost  a  2  million  lawsuit  to  Kevin   Olirri  recently.  He  can't  cash  a  break.   Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  It's  a  big  problem.   Big  problem.  But  at  least  it's  not  he's   not  getting  sued  by  the  counselor  of   Germany.  Who  could  have  been  worse?   Imagine  you  get  sued  of  can  by  counselor   of  Germany.   That  I  mean  yeah  that  that's  something   man.  That's  something.   Okay  guys,  any  questions  about  the   cryptos  or  we're  out  of  here?  I  actually   have  to  go.  I  need  to  finalize  the  book,   guys.  I'm  working  hard  finalizing  the   book.  So,  if  no  more  questions,  we  are   we're  out  of  here  and  we're  back   tomorrow.   Uh,  everything  for  free  never  works.  I   know  some  someone  always  pays  that   someone  is  you  100%.  But  as  a   socialistic  politician,  I  don't  really   care.  I  mean,  I  just  need  to  get   elected.   Once  I  elected,  we're  going  to  figure  it   out.  But  uh  that's  the  problem  also  like   trying  to  uh  think  that  they  they  care   about  what's  best.  They  don't  man.  They   need  to  get  elected.  It's  one  one  vote,   one  person.  And  uh  yeah,  how  do  you  get   the  most  votes?  Think  yourself  how  you   would  do  it.  And  that's  it  guys.

Az utolsó egy nap alatt először fordult elő, hogy a Bitcoin kereskedés nem szenvedett el ösztönzött eladótól, ami spekulációkat keltett az eladási nyomás lecsökkenéséről. A jelenlegi árfolyam-ingadozások mindennaposak, de a tendencia továbbra is bearish. Mint a múltbeli ciklusok során, a medve piacának közepén a látványos fordulat várhatóan nem idén valósul meg. A közönséges kereskedők a döntésmeghozatal során hajlamosak a szokásos impulzív stratégiákra. A jelentős piaci manipulációk során, ha fordulat is következik be, a kockázatok nagyon magasak. Az elkövetkező hetekben valószínűleg egy rövid távú emelkedés fog bekövetkezni, amit a korábbi ciklusok tapasztalatai is alátámasztanak.",
    "summary_en": "Significant changes are occurring in the Bitcoin market as Jane Street, a prominent Wall Street firm, is being sued in connection with the Terra Luna collapse. Notably, for the first time in a full trading day, Bitcoin trading occurred without a motivated seller, raising speculation about a reduction in selling pressure. Current price fluctuations continue to be daily occurrences, but the overall trend remains bearish. As observed in past cycles, a significant reversal is unlikely to occur this year amidst the bearish mid-market phase. Retail traders tend to rely on impulsive strategies when making decisions. With substantial market manipulations, the risks are exceedingly high even if a reversal would occur. A brief rally is likely in the coming weeks, supported by the historical performance of previous cycles.",
