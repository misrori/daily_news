    "transcript": "The  US  dollar  index  just  hit  a  4month   low  at  97.1,   marking  its  worst  performance  since   2017.   Gold  smashed  through  5,000  per  ounce  to   record  highs.  Yet,  Bitcoin  is  dumping   hard,  down  from  $90,400   to  $70,000  in  days.  This  breaks  every   macro  playbook.  Historically,  when  the   dollar  weakens,  Bitcoin  should  rally.   So,  what's  actually  going  on?  Today,   we're  breaking  down  the  five  forces   destroying  Bitcoin's  traditional   correlation  with  the  dollar  and   revealing  when  this  relationship  might   finally  restore  itself.  My  name  is  Lewis   and  you're  watching  the  Coin  Bureau.   Now,  for  years,  Bitcoin  and  the  DXY   moved  in  opposite  directions  with  a   negative0.65   correlation,  a  reliable  inverse   relationship.  When  the  dollar   strengthened  to  114  in  Q4  2022  during   the  Fed  rate  hikes,  Bitcoin  crashed  from   47,000  to  16,000.  When  DXY  fell  in  late   2023,  Bitcoin  rocketed  past  $40,000.  The   math  was  simple.  Weak  dollar  equals   strong  Bitcoin.  But  since  mid  2024,  this   relationship  has  fractured  completely.   The  dollar  is  now  down  1.5%  in  January   2026,  breaking  below  97  to  hit  levels   not  seen  since  February  of  2022.  Yet,   Bitcoin  refuses  to  rally.  In  fact,  it's   doing  the  opposite,  falling  from  above   $90,000  to  current  levels  around  70,000,   maybe  lower  by  the  time  that  you  watch   this  video.  And  this  isn't  just  a  blip.   The  90-day  correlation  coefficient,   which  historically  sat  at0.70,   has  broken  down  entirely.  Bitcoin  is  now   moving  with  tech  stocks,  not  against  the   dollar.  The  30-day  correlation  between   Bitcoin  and  the  NASDAQ  has  hit  0.80,   the  highest  level  in  nearly  4  years.  So,   Bitcoin  has  gone  from  being  digital  gold   to  being  a  risk  on  tech  asset.  And  that   creates  a  very  different  investment   thesis.  Now,  here's  the  twist  that  most   investors  are  missing.  A  weak  dollar   doesn't  automatically  mean  more  money  in   the  system.  Put  simply,  there's  a   massive  difference  between  dollar   weakness  and  actual  liquidity  expansion.   The  Euro  dollar  market  offshore  dollar   denominated  deposits  controls  global   liquidity  beyond  the  Fed's  reach.  This   market  is  estimated  at  $16  trillion,   more  than  double  what  it  was  in  2008.   When  the  DXY  falls  due  to  yen   intervention  or  currency  rebalancing   rather  than  Fed  easing,  actual  liquidity   doesn't  expand.  It's  a  liquidity  mirage.   Michael  Howell,  founder  of  Crossber   Capital,  has  been  tracking  this   phenomenon  with  his  global  liquidity   index.  According  to  Howell's  data,   global  liquidity  peaked  in  late  2025  at   around  187  trillion.  But  here's  the   kicker.  The  momentum  has  stalled.   Howell's  model  suggests  the  liquidity   cycle  is  hitting  its  peak  around  a  Q1  to   Q2  2026,  likely  in  March.  After  that,  he   expects  a  downturn  as  the  massive  debt   refinancing  wall  begins  to  drain   capital.  So,  even  though  the  dollar  is   weak,  liquidity  conditions  are   tightening.  This  explains  why  Bitcoin   isn't  rallying.  There's  no  actual  new   money  flowing  back  into  risk  assets.  The   Fed  ended  quantitative  tightening  in   December  of  2025  and  started  buying  $40   billion  in  Treasury  bills  monthly.  But   this  is  just  maintaining  liquidity,  not   expanding  it.  Meanwhile,  the  Euro  dollar   system  creates  and  destroys  liquidity   through  bank  balance  sheet  expansion  and   contraction  processes  that  are   completely  independent  of  the  dollar's   exchange  rate.  This  is  why  dollar   weakness  alone  isn't  really  enough.   Markets  are  treating  Bitcoin  as  a  risk   asset,  not  digital  gold.  And  the   evidence  is  overwhelming.  When   uncertainty  spikes,  trade  wars,   geopolitical  tensions,  Trump's  tariff   threats,  investors  flee  to  traditional   safe  havens.  Gold  ETFs  saw  record   inflows  in  2025  with  89  billion   globally,  the  strongest  year  ever.   Central  banks  added  863  tons  of  gold  in   2025  with  purchases  remaining  elevated   at  220  tons  in  Q3  alone.  China  has  been   buying  gold  every  single  month  while   simultaneously  selling  US  treasuries.  In   fact,  Chinese  Treasury  holdings  dropped   to  682.6   billion  in  November  of  2025,  the  lowest   since  September  of  2008.  Meanwhile,   China's  gold  reserves  increased  to  236   tons,  valued  at  over  310  billion.  And   Bitcoin,  well,  it's  getting  sold   alongside  tech  stocks.  During  recent   geopolitical  flare-ups,  Bitcoin  lost   6.6%  while  gold  rose  8.6%.  The  BTC  to   gold  ratio  hit  17.6  6  in  early  2026,   recently  touching  as  low  as  15.5,  the   lowest  in  recent  history.  For   comparison,  gold  gained  65%  in  2025,   while  Bitcoin  declined  6%.  This   completely  inverts  the  digital  gold   narrative.  And  if  you've  been  following   the  channel,  well,  you  know  that  this   creates  a  massive  opportunity  cost   problem  for  Bitcoin  holders.  And  by  the   way,  if  you're  trying  to  navigate  these   complex  macro  crosscurrens,  you  need  to   stay  informed  beyond  just  the  price   charts.

The  real  liquidity  drain   isn't  just  about  Fed  policy  or  Euro   dollars.  It's  about  the  largest  debt   refinancing  event  in  modern  history.  You   see,  there's  9  to10  trillion  in  US   government  debt  maturing  in  2026,   roughly  onethird  of  all  outstanding   debt.  This  creates  a  massive  refinancing   wall  that  sucks  capital  from  risk   assets.  Corporate  debt  maturities  are   spiking  to  roughly  $3  trillion  in  2026,   up  from  $2  trillion  in  2024.  That's  a   50%  increase.  Companies  that  borrowed  at   2  to  3%  in  2020  and  2021,  well,  they  now   face  refinancing  at  up  to  5  to  7%.  For  a   company  with  $100  million  in  debt  at  3%,   annual  interest  is  $3  million.   Refinancing  at  6%  doubles  the  interest   cost  to  6  million.  Reducing  earnings  by   $3  million  annually  without  any   operational  changes.  And  this  is  already   showing  up  in  bankruptcy  data.  2025  saw   an  81%  increase  in  mega  bankruptcies   compared  to  the  long-term  average.  Saxs   Global  filed  for  Chapter  11  in  January   2026  after  missing  a  $100  million  debt   payment.  The  company  had  borrowed  $2.7   billion  to  fund  its  merger.  Debt  it   simply  couldn't  refinance.  Meanwhile,   commercial  real  estate  is  facing  over   1.5  trillion  in  maturities  through  2026   and  2027.  Office  sector  CMBBS  loans   totaling  21.3  billion  are  coming  due   through  2026.  This  means  many  borrowers   now  face  refinancing  rates  double  or   even  triple  what  they  secured  years  ago.   This  isn't  theoretical.  This  is   happening  right  now.  And  every  dollar   that  goes  to  refinancing  existing  debt   is  a  dollar  that  doesn't  flow  into   Bitcoin  or  other  risk  assets.  Michael   Howell  warns  that  this  $40  trillion   global  debt  rollover  by  2027  creates   unprecedented  refinancing  stress.  He   calls  it  the  most  significant  threat  to   markets  in  the  2026  to  2027  window.   Meanwhile,  Japan  and  China  are  reshaping   global  liquidity  flows  in  ways  that   directly  impact  Bitcoin.  The  yen  carry   trade  on  wine,  for example,  where   investors  borrowed  cheap  yen  to  buy   riskier  assets,  is  reversing.  In   December  2025,  the  Bank  of  Japan  raised   its  policy  rate  to  0.75%.   The  highest  rate  since  1995.  Markets  are   pricing  in  another  hike  potentially  by   June  2026.  When  the  BOJ  raised  rates  in   December,  Bitcoin  dropped  from  91,000  to   88,500.  Within  2  hours,  a  2.8%  decline   that  accelerated  as  overleveraged   positions  hit  stop  losses.  The  uncarry   trade  size  is  estimated  to  be  between   261  billion  and  $500  billion.  When  this   unwinds,  it  creates  margin  calls  that   don't  discriminate.  Bitcoin  gets  sold   alongside  with  everything  else.  Japanese   officials  have  warned  against  one-sided   and  sharp  currency  moves  threatening   intervention.  In  the  158  to  160  region,   we're  moving  into  intervention  territory   where  the  BOJ  sold  around  $100  billion   in  summer  of  2024.  And  China's  moves  are   equally  significant.  China  has  sold  US   treasuries  for  nine  consecutive  months,   pushing  holdings  to  the  lowest  levels   since  2008.  This  represents  a  decline  of   more  than  47%  from  the  peak  of  1.32   trillion  in  November  of  2013.  Now,  where   is  all  of  that  capital  going?  Well,   gold.  The  People's  Bank  of  China   announced  gold  purchases  for  14   consecutive  months  through  December  of   2025.  These  aren't  retail  flows.  These   are  strategic  calculated  moves  by  the   world's  second  largest  economy.  And   these  currency  moves  drain  dollar   liquidity  that  previously  flowed  into   crypto  creating  crossber  capital  flight   away  from  risk  assets.  So  when  will  the   correlation  return?  Well,  there  are  four   key  thresholds  to  watch.  First,  Fed  rate   cuts  below  3%.  Current  rates  sit  at  3.5   to  3.75%.   Markets  are  pricing  in  two  cuts  in  2026,   potentially  one  in  June  and  one  in   October,  but  the  critical  level  is  below   3%.  That's  when  actual  liquidity   expansion  outpaces  just  dollar  weakness.   Second,  global  liquidity  expansion   resuming  after  the  2026  refinancing   crisis  passes.  Howell's  model  suggests   liquidity  will  truff  in  Q1  to  Q2  2026,   likely  around  March.  After  that,  if   central  banks  respond  with  more   aggressive  easing,  well,  we  could  see   liquidity  begin  expanding  again  in  late   Q3  or  Q4  2026.  Third,  Bitcoin  breaking   above  $94,253   resistance.  That's  the  61.8%  Fibonacci   retracement  level.  A  decisive  break   above  this  level,  confirmed  by  breaking   99,000  to  $102,000,  would  signal   technical  momentum  restoration.  The   $107,400   level  represents  a  critical  midpoint   before  attempting  all-time  highs.   Fourth,  DXY  falling  below  96.2  on  a   sustained  weekly  close.  Current  levels   are  around  97.4,  but  a  break  below  96   would  trigger  significant  technical   selling  pressure.  Historical  seasonality   suggests  April  to  May  as  a  potential   inflection  period  for  dollar  weakness.   The  pivot  point  comes  when  liquidity   expansion  outpaces  refinancing  demands.   That's  when  Bitcoin  decouples  from   riskoff  sentiment  and  reclaims  its   inverse  dollar  relationship.  Most   analysts,  including  Howell,  place  this   potential  turn  in  Q2  to  Q3  of  2026.  But   before  you  get  too  excited,  remember   that  these  conditions  need  to  align   simultaneously.  One  or  two  isn't  enough.   You  need  all  four.  Fed  cutting  below  3%,   liquidity  expanding,  Bitcoin  breaking   resistance,  and  the  dollar  breaking   support.  So  then,  what  does  this  all   mean?  Well,  the  dollar  death  doesn't   equal  Bitcoin  moon.  Not  quite  yet.  It's   about  liquidity,  not  just  currency   weakness.  The  2026  refinancing  wall  is   draining  capital,  while  gold  captures   safe  haven  flows.  Bitcoin's  correlation   with  the  dollar  has  broken  because   Bitcoin  is  being  treated  as  a  riskon   asset,  not  digital  gold.  Understanding   these  macro  forces  is  key  to  surviving   this  chop.  The  good  news  though  is  that   the  catalysts  for  reversal  are  on  the   horizon.  Q2  to  Q3  2026  could  mark  the   turning  point  when  actual  liquidity   expansion  resumes.  But  until  then,   patience  is  required.  Don't  fight  the   macro  tape.  Stay  patient.  Watch  those   four  key  indicators.  Fed  rates,  global   liquidity,  Bitcoin  resistance,  and  DXY   support.  And  most  importantly,   understand  that  sometimes  the  best  trade   is  no  trade  at  all.  The  setup  will   present  itself  when  liquidity  conditions   improve.  Now  though,  we  want  to  hear   from  you.  Are  you  rotating  into  gold  or   are  you  using  this  dip  to  stack  more   SAS?  Do  you  think  that  Bitcoin  will   reclaim  its  digital  gold  narrative  or   has  it  just  permanently  become  a  tech   stock?  Let  us  know  in  the  comments   below.  And  if  you  want  to  understand   more  about  how  the  debt  refinancing  wall   is  reshaping  markets,  well,  you  can   check  out  that  video  right  over  here.   And  if  you're  wondering  whether  gold's   rally  can  continue,  well,  we  covered   that  in  depth  right  over  here.  Thank  you   so  much  for  watching.  We'll  see  you   again  soon.  This  is  Lewis  signing  off.",
    "sort_data": "2026-02-15",
    "summary_hu": "A dollárindex 97,1-re csökkent, amely 4 hónapja a legalacsonyabb értékét jelenti, míg a Bitcoin drámaian visszaesett 90 400 dollárról 70 000 dollárra. A hagyományos összefüggés szerint, amikor a dollár gyengül, a Bitcoin-nak erősödnie kellene, ami most nem történik meg. Az árfolyamok csökkenése a Bitcoin történelmileg megszokott korrelációjának teljes megszakadását jelzi a DXY-vel. A Bitcoin most a technológiai részvényekkel együtt mozog, nem pedig a dollárral szemben. Emellett a globális likviditás feltételei szigorodnak, és nincs elegendő új pénzáramlás a kockázati eszközök felé, ami a Bitcoin árára is hatással van. Az eladósodás problémái, különösen a kormányzati és vállalati újrafinanszírozási hullám, köszik a tőkéket, a befektetők pedig a hagyományos biztonsági eszközök felé fordulnak, mint a gold. A videó szerint a Bitcoin negatív korrelációja a dollárral legkorábban 2026 közepén helyreállhat, azonban ehhez négy kulcsmutatónak össze kell állnia.",
    "summary_en": "The dollar index has fallen to a four-month low of 97.1, while Bitcoin has plummeted dramatically from $90,400 to $70,000. Historically, when the dollar weakens, Bitcoin is expected to rise, yet this correlation has completely broken down. Bitcoin is now moving in tandem with tech stocks instead of inversely with the dollar. Additionally, global liquidity conditions are tightening with no new money flowing into risk assets, adversely affecting Bitcoin's price. The challenges of refinancing, especially in government and corporate debt, are draining capital away from riskier investments, with investors flocking to traditional safe havens like gold. According to the video, Bitcoin’s negative correlation with the dollar might not stabilize until mid-2026, requiring the convergence of four key indicators to happen.",
