        "transcript": "So, the Anthropic CEO Dario Modi just said something crazy. He says his engineers haven't written any code in two months. Claude does all of it. So, we're going to break down what that means for every industry. Then, in clip two, Tom Lee explains why he thinks Greenland anxiety was actually your buying opportunity. And I want to dig in as to whether that logic holds up. And at the end, I've got a bonus clip where Dario tells us what he thinks about AI and it not being a bubble. Check this out. >> Can we start with a kind of rough status of how the industry is going? You and your rivals, how close are we now to artificial general intelligence or set the stage for us first and then we can talk about the morality of it all. >> Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for thanks for having me. I mean, you know, I've I've never liked the artificial general intelligence or super intelligence. Not because I I I I don't think AI is very powerful, right? I'm not I'm I'm not a skeptic. I'm actually extreme in terms of my views of how powerful the technology is going to be, but it's the wrong model for thinking about it that there will be some one point where we build something completely different. What we see here actually what we've seen for the last 10 years maybe even 15 and and you know me and Anthropus co-founders were among the first to document it is this very smooth exponential exponential process just like in the '9s you saw Moore's law that you know the the the amount of computing power would double every 12 months or every 18 months we have a Moore's law like law except it's for intelligence itself for for the cognitive ability of the model across many tasks. And so what we are seeing is that that cognitive ability is you know depending on how you measure it doubling every you know four to four to 12 months. Uh and and so you know we're just climbing the ladder of cognitive ability and where we are now is you know to take coding as one example that's been exploding really fast over the last year or two. I have engineers. In fact, the the team that leads one of our bleed products, Claude Code, which is the way you use our models for for coding. Um, uh, he says he hasn't written any code in the last two months. Uh, he's it's all Claude. He's he's edited, he's looked at it, but it's all been written by Claude. Indeed, we recently released this thing called co-work, which was bringing Claude code to um, you know, non-coding tasks. it it really seems to have taken off. We wrote it in like a week and a half almost entirely with cloud code. So I think we're entering the world where you know the the junior level software engineers maybe many of the tasks of the more senior level software engineers are are starting to be done you know most of the way by by AI systems. Now that's going to go further. It's going to be more end to end. The projects going to be more but I think we're going to be surprised at how the exponential turns upward. Right? The whole the whole thing about exponentials is, you know, it looks like it's going very very slowly. It speeds up a little bit and then it just zooms past you. And I I I think we're I think we're on the precipice. I think we're a year or two away from it really zooming past us. Sounds very like going bankrupt. But the when when this happens you in terms of the kind of running order, there's yourself, there's Gemini, there's OpenAI. Where do you put Are you all together at the moment roughly? >> Yeah. I mean you got a lot of hype for your most >> I think as the field has developed um you know I think it's no longer appropriate to think of it as like you know like a scaler you know like runners in a race who are at one position the players have gone in different directions so some of the other players have gone in a very consumer oriented direction and that leads you to make your models you know superhumanly engaging or superhumanly good at recommending shopping or ads or various things like that. Anthropic has focused, I think, first and foremost on enterprises, developers, and to the extent we do consumer, we're very focused on productivity and and the kind of high value end of the of the consumer work. And so that that gives very that gives very different incentives, right? If you if you want to get things done, um, you know, we talked about AGI and super intelligence before. One of the things I would say is that, you know, there are super intelligences today and they're basically large corporations, right? They're smarter than any human can be at, you know, solving the problem of, you know, shipping shipping commerce the lowest possible cost or making solar panels the lowest possible cost or launching rockets at the lowest possible possible cost. And and so there's really high returns to intelligence in this area, which I think incentivizes us to to kind of to kind of build the right thing. AI capability is doubling every 4 to 12 months and we're about to hit the steep part of the curve where it zooms past human level performance in most cognitive tasks. So Dario said something here that I think is worth highlighting. He says they've got an engineer and this isn't just some random guy. This is the person leading claw code one of their flagship products who hasn't written a single line of code in 2 months. It's all clawed now. He edits it. He reviews it. But the actual writing of the code, that's all AI. And they've built their newest product, Coowwork, in a week and a half using the same product. The exponential thing here he's describing, and I've heard other people talk about this too, as the models get smarter at coding, they accelerate the development of everything else. You've got AI systems now that can go through data, restructure it, auto tag edge cases, run simulations, all the stuff that used to take engineering teams months. And every time the coding agent improves, that development timeline compresses. Three months from now, whatever took a week takes a day. And I think what Dario is really getting at is that we keep underestimating this because exponentials feel slow until suddenly they don't. He uses the phrase zooming past us. And I don't think he's being hyperbolic. If we're doubling cognitive capability every 4 to 12 months, you're dealing with something that looks flat, flat, flat, and then suddenly vertical, very vertical. and his prediction is we're one or two years away from that very vertical moment. I've personally been using claw code and other vibe coding tools like Replet and the results have honestly been mind-blowing. I was a complete amateur, never coded in my life and I was able to create useful tools for myself and my company in a few hours. It's really that powerful. For example, I have lots of editors who create text animations and sometimes they make spelling mistakes. It's a very frustrating thing to find those spelling mistakes in text animations. I can now run it through an AI tool which I've made and it checks for all these typos. The other thing I found interesting is when Dario pushes back on the AGI framing. He says super intelligence already exists. They're just called corporations. Company like Amazon is smarter than any living human at solving logistic problems. What AI does is it gives you the same kind of distributed intelligence, but now any developer or small team can now access it. That's a massive power shift. The question isn't really when do we hit AGI, it's how fast does the capability spread and who captures the value from it. Now, if you're finding all this AI stuff super interesting, I built a course that breaks it all down step by step. And to be honest, it's the course I wish I had when I first started researching AI. You can join today to get lifetime access and the price will be going up as we add new modules which we're thinking about doing soon. If you want to gain lifetime access, join now before we increase the price. So that's the technology accelerating but what does that mean for markets right now especially when you've got all this geopolitical noise creating volatility. Tom Le's being one of the more consistently bullish voices on Wall Street and he's making the case that the green and anxiety or the tariff fears the Japan stuff. It was all overdone and he thinks you should be buying that dip. Let's see if his logistics holds up. >> Tom, it's great to have you react to the president and what's happening in the market. So, a framework to a deal. No force. All is well now for the Bulls. >> Scott, I I think so. You know, I I'd say on Monday morning before the open, I think investors were very concerned about Greenland and and what's happened in Japan and they thought of 20, you know, 2025 when it took eight weeks for stocks to find their low, you know, down 20%. So, I think there was a lot of fear. So, today's news really does do a lot to diffuse a lot of that anxiety and I think it's wise to buy that dip. >> Yeah. I mean, as part of this, of course, the president also saying no tariffs on Europe on February 1st, and that's what really upset um the market. Are are you still looking though, Tom, as positive as you might sound for a bare market sometime around midyear? >> Uh that's right, Scott. I think they have been pretty clear that we think that there is going to be a midyear hiccup. uh it could be around policy or it could be around the new Fed being challenged. Uh but that's coming from us markets being at a higher level. And I think one of the mistakes people make whenever they hear that commentary is they think it means to go to cash. Now, as you know, we've advised to stay invested and to buy to dip. But yes, uh there is a lot of good taking place in 2026, but we do have a lot that's already been priced in because of three good years of market gain. What dip would you be buying specifically? >> Uh well, Princeton, >> I would I would be buying the dip on companies that have good earnings visibility or a structural reason to be long because those that got sold yesterday, for instance, they're still the same great company. They were just 10% cheaper. I mean, to me, that's a stock I'd want to buy. The names I'd want to avoid are companies that are in the bullseye of White House policy. As we know last year white house the white house picked winners and losers you know created problems for healthcare and consulting company this year it's credit card issuers you know institutional buyers single family homes and that's you know some countries too so I think that's the stocks to avoid but I think fundamentally strong you still want to buy the dare Tom's framework for buying dips works better when you separate companies with structural tailwinds from companies caught in policy crosshairs so Tom's core argument is pretty straightforward. Investors were scared at the start of last week. They thought they were looking at another 8-week draw down like in 2020 or the correction we had last year and then the news diffused the anxiety. Stocks on sale, good companies are cheaper. Tom says buy the dip and he's been pretty accurate with these calls over the years. To be fair to him, the guy has a track record. But I think the more useful part of what he said is the distinction between fundamentally strong names versus companies in the policy bullseye. Tom specifically calls out credit card issuers, institutional buyers of single family homes, and certain countries. These are names where the White House can create problems through executive action or regulatory pressure. And that's a different kind of risk than just market volatility. That's structural risk that doesn't go away when anxiety settles down. The dip buying logic works best when you've got companies with good earnings visibility or what Tom calls a structural reason to be wrong. Meaning the market is mispricing something fundamental about the business. What add to Tom's framework is we're in a market where the AI beneficiaries, the companies actually capturing value from the exponential improvement Dario was talking about, those are increasingly separating from everything else. So when you're looking at the dip, the question isn't just in my opinion, is the company fundamentally strong? It's also, is this company positioned for where compute and automation are going? Because if you're buying a dip in a business that AI is about to disrupt, the cheap price might be justified. Now, let's watch my bonus clip. This is from Anthropic CEO and it's about where AI is heading and if that is towards a bubble or not. Another issue in this, you know, it could be you could be right. All this technology be going in the right direction, but economically we could be heading towards a bubble. Do you think that's true? >> Yeah. Yeah. So um I would separate out the two things. One is the basic exponential. Um and that's what we've been talking about. That's been kind of the technological direction. Um and there, you know, just like with Mo's law, you can never be sure that the technology is sort of fully going to advance. It's going to keep going, right? It's a fundamentally inductive problem. But now that I've seen well over a decade of it, I would say I am pretty confident that it's going to continue or at least I'm more confident than I've ever been at any time in the past that it's going to continue to where the models are basically smarter than humans at at almost everything. And I think there's a good chance that even happens in the next year or two. Again, seems far away, but but this property of exponentials that they like they they they catch you by surprise. And if it's not a year or two, I think it's pretty likely that it's, you know, at least less than 5 years within the 2020s. I think this moment will come in the 2020s. I I'll get into that economic AGI. Yeah, I I'll I'll get into the economic diffusion which I think is complicated, but I don't want anyone to forget like that, you know, that as long as we have that fundamental technological gain, like there's going to be many trillions of revenue, maybe many trillions per company in this in this area because the economic potential is so great. Now there's a separate thing which is that we don't know how fast enterprises, companies are actually going to be able to use this technology, right? The the the uses of this what the technology is capable of today is probably 10 times what the enterprise of the world are are able to are able to deploy. And and I see it with our customers every day where I'll talk to a CEO and they'll understand and their executive team will understand the power of this technology, you know, for for automating customer service, for coding, for many other things, but they have a company of tens of thousands of people who are perfectly brilliant people but experts in something that is not AI and have to learn to use AI and that you know different names for it, change management, enterprise transformation, whatever it's called. the the need to do this is very slow. It can take years. And so we have this powerful technology that I have an incredible amount of confidence will generate trillions in revenue, but we don't know exactly when. You know, plus plus or minus a few years. We don't know exactly when. And and and in the meantime, companies have to buy compute to serve all that revenue. And you you don't want to buy too much because, you know, you could financially overextend yourself. And you don't want to buy too little because then you can't serve all the revenue. And and so that's where the kind of economic and financial problem is. >> One of our clients started with zero audience. Now they're doing $100,000 months thanks to YouTube. And they're not alone.
