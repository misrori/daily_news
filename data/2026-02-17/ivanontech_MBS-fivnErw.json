    "transcript": "Welcome  to  another  episode.  And  as  you   can  see  right  now,  Bitcoin  is  currently   at  $68,000.  And  the  last  stream  we  did   was  on  Friday.  So,  let's  do  a  bit  of  a   recap.  And  then  we're  going  to  be   discussing,  of  course,  how  low  we're   going  to  fall.  Because  right  now,  many   people  are  really,  really  struggling.   Why?  Because  the  market  is  freaking   boring.  Literally,  nothing  has  happened.   It's  the  same  price  as  last  week,  the   same  price  as  a  week  ago.  The  only   exception  are,  of  course,  the  old  coins,   which  keep  going  down.  We  have  many  many   people  in  our  community  shorting  this   market  for  a  living.  I  will  soon  explain   to  you  more  how  this  works.  But  uh  this   is  the  still  the  shortest  market.  We're   still  in  the  shortterest  market.  But   what's  interesting  is  that  the  week   closed  and  what  happened?  We  see  another   red  candle,  another  slow  bleed.  This   really  kills  a  lot  of  sentiment.  People   don't  like  the  slow  bleed.  But  just  like   we  said  down  here  at  60  that  Bitcoin   either  that  goes  very  high  now  and   erases  this  candle,  this  one  right  here.   You  remember  when  we  fell  all  the  way   here,  we  said  either  we  erase  this   candle  fast  or  we're  going  to  have  slow   bleed.  What  happened?  We  have  slow   bleed.  We  did  not  erase  the  candle.  We   did  not  have  a  week  here  that  pumped   above  it.  So  instead,  we're  stuck  with   slow  bleed.  Perfectly  perfectly   expected.  Perfectly  expected.  And  if   you've  been  watching  this  for  years,   it's  not  news.  Confirm  in  the  comment   section.  We  said,  \"Listen,  it  goes   down.\"  so  low.  There's  so  much  damage   done  to  the  chart.  The  only  thing  that   can  save  it  is  some  kind  of  super  strong   week  that  follows  that  destruction  that   happened  here  in  the  beginning  of   February.  We  did  not  get  that.  We   absolutely  did  not  get  that.  Instead,  we   had  another  slow  bleed  week  and  another   slow  bleed  week  and  another  slow  bleed.   So,  all  in  all,  we're  coming  down  into   the  buy  zone,  guys.  We're  bleing  down   and  sooner  or  later,  we're  going  to  be   here  in  the  buy  zone.  Here's  the  good   news,  guys.  Here's  the  good  news.  I  want   to  give  you  the  bad  news  and  the  good   news.  Like  the  the  bad  news  is  that  we   are  going  to  slide  down  most  likely.  The   good  news  is  that  I  think  within  a  few   quarters  we're  out  of  here.  We're  out  of   here  and  back  into  bull  because  the   current  sentiment  is  so  bad.  It's  quite   crazy.  Everyone  is  saying  that  Bitcoin   is  dead.  Everyone  is  saying  that  it's   over.  This  guy  from  Bloomberg  said  that   the  Bitcoin  has  unlimited  supply   suddenly  and  said  it's  going  to  go  to   10K.  First  he  said  10K,  but  then  he   started  to  speak  about  that  it's  going   to  go  to  zero.  I  will  not  play  the  full   clip.  It's  I  mean  the  the  clip  is  not   even  good.  He  just  says  that  it's  going   to  go  to  10k.  First  he  said  10k  but  then   he  also  said  yeah  maybe  even  lower.   That's  number  one.  Number  two  there  is   I'm  showing  you  here  just  demonstrations   of  the  sentiment.  Okay  we're  not  going   to  watch  the  the  full  thing  because   there  is  a  little  value  in  that.  And   next  woo  willy  willy  woo  willywoo  is   saying  what  12year  trend  broken  versus   gold.  He's  saying  it's  phenito  bitcoin   should  be  a  lot  higher  relative  to  gold.   It's  not.  is  because  of  quantum  quantum   quantum  quantum  is  going  to  kill   Bitcoin.  So  very  negative  very  very   negative.  You  have  ran  crypto  banter  big   shout  out  but  he's  all  saying  you  know   I'm  questioning  the  Bitcoin  thesis.  You   know  everyone  is  questioning  questioning   the  Bitcoin  thesis.  It  was  supposed  to   be  peer-to-peer  cash  and  digital  gold.   We  got  ETF.  We  got  everything  everything   and  still  is  down.  So  I  really  love  this   kind  of  sentiment  guys.  I  mean  this  is   exactly  what  we  want.  But  I  think  we   need  to  crush  the  souls  even  more.  I   think  we're  almost  there,  crushing,  but   I  still  some  people  are  still  too   hopeful.  I  say  some  I  think  we  still   need  a  a  last  leg  down  to  flush  and   that's  exactly  what  we're  seeing  here  on   the  chart.  You  see,  we're  still  above   the  buy  zone.  We  need  another  leg  down   to  really  crush  even  more  because  some   people  are  still  hopeful.  But  if  you've   been  watching  the  channel,  that's  what   we've  been  waiting  for.  We  need  to  crush   the  soul  of  everyone  who  is  still   hopeful.  Fully  crush  it,  fully  destroy   it,  fully  obliterate  it.  Everyone  who   hopes  for  a  V-shaped  recovery,  people   have  been  telling  to  themselves  since   October,  since  we're  riskoff,  we're   derisked.  Everyone  since  then  when  we   were  going  down  have  been  saying  it's   going  to  be  recovery,  recovery,  please   recover.  So  much  hope.  And  listen,  on  a   personal  level,  I  I  feel  for  everyone.   But  on  a  professional  trading  level,  I   have  to  be  upfront  and  say  that  they   need  to  be  fully  crushed.  If  someone   still  hopes  for  a  Vshape,  we  will  have   another  leg  down.  Okay?  And  so  I  think   now  we're  getting  quite  close.  We're   getting  cl  quite  close  where  most  people   have  given  up  and  that's  exactly  when   the  bare  market  stops.  That's  exactly   when  we  start  going  up.  It's  classic   guys.  The  plebe  gets  robbed  by  the   market  yet  again.  And  exactly  exactly   exactly  in  the  same  fashion  it  was  in   the  last  cycle,  the  cycle  before  that.   It's  on  repeat.  Everything  is  on  repeat.   And  right  now  we  are  approaching  this   zone  where  people  are  giving.  Yeah,   maybe  Tom  Lee  has  to  give  up.  Someone   saying  Tom  Lee  has  not  given  up.   Exactly.  Tom  Lee  has  to  give  up.  I  think   the  only  thing  we're  missing  is  kind  of   some  kind  of  a  collapse.  I  would  love  to   see  something  break.  Maybe  Binance,   maybe  Micro  Strategy.  I  mean,  who  the   hell  knows?  I'm  not  saying  that  any  of   them  are  close  to  it.  We  don't  know.  We   don't  know.  But  if  you  have  something   big  break,  that  would  be  like  the  final   biggest  confirmation.  Hallelujah.  It  is   the  bottom.  Is  that  what  we're  looking   for?  We  don't  have  it  yet,  guys.  We   don't  have  it.  I  think  we  need  another   leg  down.  Although  you  should  know  that   we  are  now  at  all-time  high  for  this   cycle.  When  it  comes  to  despair,  and   that's  great.  Alltime  high  when  it  comes   to  this  cycle,  when  it  comes  to  panic,   that's  great.  Boredom,  that's  great.   People  giving  up,  that's  great.  That's   exactly  what  what  we  want  to  see  in   terms  of  being  confident  in  entering  at   this  cheap  cheap  levels  here  within  the   buy  zone.  And  remember,  we're  still  not   in  the  buy  zone.  We're  close,  but  we're   not  in  the  buy  zone.  Instead  of   following  whatever  your  favorite  other   influencer  tells  you  with,  you  know,  ple   cycle  top  indic  whatever  they  tell  you   all  the  fugazi.  Instead,  the  the  true   indication  is  full  despair.  And  guys,   we're  not  there  yet,  but  we're  getting   close.  We're  getting  close.  Another  big   fat  leg  down  would  really  put  all all  of   this  in  order.  Now,  guys,  I  want  to  show   you  something  very  important.  And  this   is  this  tweet  from  Hib.  I  love  it.  I   love  it  what  he's  saying  here.  I've  felt   always  felt  that  I'm  a  better  bare   market  investor  than  a  bull  market   investor.  Bull  markets  are  hard.  What  is   there  to  say?  Everything  is  going  up  and   it  will  keep  going  up  forever.  I  mean   there's  so  hard  to  find  them.  They  so   hard  to  find  real  value  opportunities.  I   mean  bull  market  you  just  hope  that  you   you're  not  the  last  one  buying  and  then   you  enter  the  bull  trend  and  hopefully   you  didn't  enter  too  late.  So  that's  it.   But  in  the  bare  market  it's  simpler.   Very  very  very  much  simp.  Way  way  much   simpler.  The  noise  dies  down.   Notoriously  you  are  you  win  in  a  bare   market  by  not  letting  the  dreary  mood   deter  you.  That's  why  I  give  you  a  bit   of  positivity  guys.  I'm  telling  you  we   need  to  crush  the  sentiment  of  everyone.   But  we  ourselves  we're  not  deterred.  I   mean  we  are  actually  very  excited.   Actually  some  people  are  saying  Ivan  why   are  you  so  excited?  You've  never  been  so   excited.  Even  in  the  bull  market  you   have  not  been  so  excited.  Some  guys  some   guy  told  me  I  even  in  in  a  bull  market   you  haven't  been  so  excited.  Well,  the   reason  is  like  we  see  on  the  screen   right  here  in  the  bull  market,  it's  not   as  exciting.  Why?  Because  Bitcoin  is  way   above  the  200E  moving  average.   Everything  is  so  freaking  expensive.   Yes,  it  probably  will  go  higher  in  a   bull  market.  Uh  but  um  again,  it's  not   this,  you  know,  crazy  conviction  trade   you  can  make  as  in  the  bear  kind  of  in   the  times  we're  we're  starting  to  enter   now.  So,  you  win  in  a  bare  market  by  not   letting  the  dreary  mood  deter  you.  We're   not  letting  letting  that  happen  to  us.   Please  confirm  in  the  comment  section   that  you're  not  allowing  the  dreary  mood   uh  affect  you.  Instead,  you  are  on  the   sidelines.  You  understand  that  we  still   need  to  crush  the  sentiment  a  bit  more.   We  need  to,  you  know,  all  of  these   hopeful  investors  in  the  rise.  Each  and   every  five  minute  tick  that  is  green,   they  hope  now  is  V-shaped  recovery.  They   need  to  be  fully  giving  giving  up.  They   need  to  give  up.  They  need  to  give  up.   They  need  to  give  up.  They  need  to  say   it's  bare  market.  That's  when  bare   market  ends.  Simply  put,  you  win  in  a   bare  market  by  believing  in  the  future   when  no  one  else  does.  I  mean,  that's   true.  That's  true.  I  mean,  that's   exactly  exactly  what  we're  doing.  And   so,  I  want  to  also  highlight  some  of  the   important  comments  that  uh  that  were   published  on  our  channel  within  the  last   few  days.  So,  one  of  the  guys  said  the   following.  Big  shout  to  Rich.  He  said,   \"When  is  someone  going  to  wreck  the  Bull   Mania  shorts?\"  Because  every  day  I  give   you  all  of  the  gains  we  make  in  Bull   Mania  from  shorting.  I  mean  I  I  I  can   make  like  a  thousandpage  book  just  from   all  of  the  gains  from  shorting  because   now  it  is  bare  market.  So  it's  shorting.   It's  shorting.  I  mean  people  ask  Ian  how   do  you  define  bare  market?  Well  maybe   like  this  when  the  only  way  to  really   make  money  is  by  short  short.  But  it's  a   very  important  question  like  is  it   really  possible  to  wreck  the  bull  mania   traders  who  are  shorting.  But  the   question  really  when  you  read  the   question  I  see  that  Rick  doesn't  really   understand  what  we're  doing  here  because   it  is  impossible  to  do  because  due  to   mechanical  rules  you  have  stop  loss  you   have  position  sizing  you  have  exit   scenario  so  wrecking  bullman  shortters   by  definition  is  impossible  you  never   have  big  loss  with  mechanical  rules  you   always  have  all  of  the  upside  but  the   downside  is  very  limited  because   everything  is  probabilistic  you  never   want  small  mistakes  turn  turn  into  big   disasters  just  like  this  guy  is  saying   in  our  discord  voma  done  as  a  rec  play   Uh  I  was  so  afraid  of  shorting  with   leverage.  I  had  no  problem  holding   holding  alt  minus  98%  down  though.  This   the  problem.  People  don't  don't  want  to   do  healthy  sound  trades  but  they  have  no   problem  to  hold  down  minus  98%.  So  don't   be  discriminating.  Some  people  are   discriminating  against  shorting  because   to  them  it  feels  like  super  division  or   something  to  short.  Instead,  they   hodddle  their  [ __ ]  down  98%  and  they   see  it  as  a  more  sounder  strategy   because  they  can  really  envision   themselves  as  part  of  the  community   so-called  community  which  is  for  guys   it's  a  matrix  that  they  live  in  because   community  means  that  the  founder  already   left  months  ago.  They  did  a  soft  exit   scam  where  they  didn't  declare  that  it's   over  but  they  kind  of  you  know  kind  of   become  more  and  more  passive.  Everyone   who  was  early  still  still  already  out   and  you're  still  down  holding.  You  think   you're  in  community.  Isn't  it  crazy?  I   mean  people  think  that  shorting  is  some   kind  of  high  risk  alo  super  I'm  super   risky  listen  instead  you  you  huddle  your   [ __ ]  you  believe  in  the  narrative  in   the  false  narrative  that  the  coin  team   is  telling  you  that's  irresponsible  so   this  guy  start  shorting  last  week   account  already  up  50%  in  two  weeks   thanks  to  the  mechanical  rules  now  I   always  remind  people  don't  get  hubris  I   mean  people  sometimes  they  get  hubris  I   keep  reminding  them  always  mechanical   rules  always  stop-  loss  always  position   sizing  big  shout  also  to  Bobcat  because   He  learned  the  mechanical  rules  and  he's   saying  I'm  addicted.  The  mechanical  uh   course  is  amazing  and  uh  he  started  to   short  the  crap  out  of  Sulan.  So  very   very  nice.

It  is  it  is   the  shorter  market.  It's  the  shorter   market  also.  It  is  okay  if  you  have  dry   pad  just  wait  for  good  entries  but   otherwise  it  is  the  shortest  market.  It   is  what  it  is.  Uh  soon  is  going  to  be   the  the  long  market  is  going  to  be  the   bullish  market  but  not  yet.  We're  still   in  the  shortest  market.  We  have  to  see   for  what  it  is.  It  doesn't  matter  if  you   want  to  have  sunglasses  and  you  go   outside  it  is  snow.  It  is  still  snow.   Some  people  want  the  bull  market  to  come   back  like  they  try  to  force  it  but  at   the  end  of  the  day  it's  like  you  taking   on  sunglasses  and  going  out  into  the   snow  in  Siberia  and  somehow  you  think   that  the  world  will  adapt  to  you.   Instead  embrace  the  world  as  it  is.  We   are  now  still  in  a  bare  trend  in  a  heavy   brutal  bare  trend.  Solana  is  still  above   $30.  Okay.  XRB  all  of  these  there  are   many  coins  that  that  that  still  need  to   flash.  It's  probably  going  to  happen.   And  if  it  doesn't  happen,  if  they  pump,   fantastic.  Mechanical  rules  will  stop   you  out.  Boop.  Fantastic.  But  you  need   to  know  them.  That's  why  you  go  to   bullman.com.  Guys,  also  big  shout  out  to   Guzman  for  time  stopping  us  today.  Great   great  having  you  all  back.  And  by  the   way,  as  you  know,  we  I  came  back  from   travels  a  bit  earlier.  I  plan  to  not   even  do  a  stream  today.  So  if  you   appreciate  extra  extra  emergency  stream,   smash  up  the  like  because  actually  could   make  it  today.  Look  here,  Grant  Cardone.   Another  one.  Uh  I  mean  he's  a  bit  lost.   I  feel  a  bit  sorry  for  his  like   investors  in  his  fund  or  whatever  he  has   with  Bitcoin.  But  he's  always  I  mean  in   his  post  I  see  this  like  pleber  wreck   noob  kind  of  u  uh  kind  of  brain.  Big   shout  out  to  Gr.  I  mean  I  love  Grant.  I   love  Grant.  I  love  Grant  10x.  I  I  love   Grant.  But  you  know  when  he  post  like   this  it  looks  to  me  like  Bitcoin  has   been  in  a  bare  market  for  almost  two   years.  Am  I  missing  something?  Last  time   it  did  this  it  went  up  4x.  He's  like,   \"Guys,  are  we  going to  go  up  4x?\"   Because  I  drew  with  my  finger  here  on  my   phone  this  big  fat  finger  line  on  the  on   the  photo  app  in  the  default  like,  you   know,  drawing,  you  know,  guys.  Are  we   going  to  go  up  4x  from  here?   This  is  one  of  the  signals  you  see.   Grant  doesn't  really  know  what  the hell   he's  doing.  Bare  market  for  four.  What?   What  the  hell  are  we  speaking  about?  We   went  to  alltime  high  here  in  October.   We're  in  bare  since  October.  Okay,  we're   in  bear  since  October.  Don't  make  it  too   complex.  I  I  this  is  one  of  the  signals   that  someone  is  new.  They  try  to  like   interpret,  oh,  we're  in  bare  market.   They  have  this  obsession  with  labels.   For  example,  someone  said,  Ivan,  you're   not  a  Bitcoiner.  You  sound  like  Peter   Schiff  because  I  told  you  to  be  riskoff   since  October.  So  people  like,  Ian,   you're  not  a  So  they  have  this  label.   But  when  it  comes  to  people,  they  label   people  like  me,  for example.  You  sound   you're  not  a  Bitcoiner.  You're  not   you're  not  you're  not  a  true  crypto   bitcoin.  And  then  another  label  that   people  really  want  to  stick  to  is  bare   market.  We've  been  in  for  four  years  in   bare  market.  What  it  means  like  what's   the  definition  of  your  bare  market  that   we  are  we're  back  to  the  levels  in  2024.   Does  that  mean  it's  been  a  bare  market   all  along?  Absolutely  not.  But  this  is   what  people  try  to  kind  of  squeeze  in   the  reality.  They  have  they  have  an  idea   what  would  be  amazing  if  you  know  it   would  be  amazing  if  we  were  in  in  bare   market  for  four  years.  So  Grant  has  this   idea.  Wouldn't  it  be  amazing  if  I  can   say  that  we're  in  bare  market  for  four   years  because  it  means  then  we're  going   to  pump  like  tomorrow  and  then  on  the   chart  he  sees  hey  holy  crap  maybe  it   does  make  sense  and  then  he  tries  to   align  he  tries  to  fit  the  reality  into   his  uh  wishful  thinking.  Okay,  the  good   thing  for  Grant  is  that  we  will  go  up   later  this  year.  Most  likely  it's  going   to  happen.  But  uh  you  you  need  to  you   you  need  to  understand  that  listen  this   bare  market  label  has  destroyed  many   many  many  portfolios  many  portfolios.   People  have  this  idea  that  uh  they  try   to  fit  to  label  the  the  the  chart.   Instead,  keep  it  simple.  If  the  trend  is   down,  be  bearish.  If  the  Bitcoin  is  in  a   bare  trend,  you're  bearish.  If  it's  in  a   bull  trend,  you're  bullish.  So  that's   it.  That's  it.  That's  it.  Don't  make  it   more  complex.  It  is  as  simple  as  this.   You  don't  have  to  look  at  pi  cycle  top   indicator  because  also  another  problem   is  that  a  lot  of  indicators  simply  don't   flash  this  time  like  no  pi  cycle  top   whatever  people  mayor  multiple  what   people  have  there.  Instead  it's  just  the   trend  guys  is  the  price  is  a  trend  keep   it  simple  and  that's  it.  Let's  look  at   the  overall  market  uh  what  we  have  there   with  uh  bubbles.  Uh  let  me  know  if  you   are  in  profit  anything  here  is  if  you  if   you  made  any  money  but  yeah  it's  uh  it's   sideways  sideways  uh  not  too  great   sideways.  Oh,  fear  and  greed.  Yes,   that's  interesting.  Let's  see.  Fear  and   greed.  What's  happening?  We're  extreme   fear.  Extreme  fear.  Um,  this  is  not  a   tradable  metric  really.  And  we  discussed   it  in  our  I  discuss  it  on  YouTube  a  lot   that  fear  and  greed  is  not  really   tradable  because  something  that's  super   fearful  can  still  go  down  a  lot.  Here  it   was  10  when  fear  and  grit  was  10  when   Bitcoin  was  84k  and  now  it  is  uh  70k  and   it's  uh  yeah,  it's  also  like  10  9.  So  it   was  low  here.  it  can  go  way  lower  and   still  be  super  fear,  super  fearful.   Okay,  so  I  don't  know  how  people  trade   it.  Uh  but  people  love  commenting  fear   and  greed.  So  we  are  in  extreme  fear.   Absolutely.  We're  in  extreme  fear.  What   does  it  mean?  Will  we  continue  to  go   down?  You  cannot  conclude  anything  based   on  this.  Based  on  this,  you  cannot   conclude  anything.  But  yes,  it's  a  bit   of  an  extreme  fear.  Maybe  it  goes  up  a   bit  to  neutral  uh  within  the  coming   within  the  coming  days.  But  um  uh  I   wouldn't  count  on  that.  Instead  I  would   be  looking  at  how  this  year  is  doing   versus  other  midterm  years  and  u  the   only  hopeium  I  can  give  you  is  that  if   you  look  just  seasonally  seasonally  on   midterm  years  some  of  them  do  have  a  bit   of  a  pump  towards  early  March  like  for   example  you  see  here  the  purple  one  uh   and  the  purple  one  is  which  2022   um  and  the  and  the  yellow  one  also  had  I   mean  actually  yellow  purple  and  orange   right  here  around  day  between  day  60  and   uh  70ish  they  have  a  bit  of  a  pump  and   now  we  are  in  day  47.  So  maybe  within   the  coming  days  we  will  see  a  bit  of  a   pump.  I  mean  I  would  put  more  uh  weight   on  this  just  just  based  on  math.  I  mean   you  see  how  closely  it's  been  following.   We're  right  now  you  know  right  on  the   average  of  all  of  the  midterm  years.  And   we've  been  following  it  since  the  early   days.  You  remember  at  the  beginning  of   the  year  Bitcoin  pumped  a  bit.  Everyone   was  so  excited.  I  had  to  tell  you  guys   don't  be  excited.  People  hated  me  for   that.  I  told  you  guys  listen  there  it's   not  uncommon  and  actually  we  didn't  even   pump  that  much  in  comparison  to  other   midterm  years  in  the  beginning  of  the   year  you  see  the  green  one  which  is  the   current  year  that  didn't  even  pump  that   much  but  people  were  so  excited  people   said  bare  market  over  it  is  the  super   cycle  let's  go  super  cycle  and  like  this   okay  the  same  thing  guys  if  we  pump  now   um  I  would  also  likely  tell  you  to  keep   it  a  bit  cool  because  uh  amuse  yourself   yeah  all  of  them  they  have  a  magnet  And   that's  and  the  magnet  is  that  they  end   the  year  between  50%  down  and  uh  70%   down  for  the  year.  And  currently  we  are   how  much  down?  We're  only  20%  down.  21.   So  can  still  go  way  lower.  That's  why   the  buy  zone  is  quite  big  here.  Okay.   Buy  zone  is  quite  big.  And  the  only   reason  it  makes  sense  to  nibble  a  bit  is   in  case  you're  fully  okay  mentally  that   we  may  go  way  way  lower.  But  because   everything  is  probabilistic,  we  have  a   buy  zone.  We  don't  have  a  buy  level.  We   have  a  buy  zone  where  long-term,  you   know,  if  you  buy  somewhere  here  in  the   buy  zone,  it's  going  to  be  okay.   Long-term,  it's  going  to  be  okay.  Yes,   if  you  buy  here  at  60,  you  may  have  to   huddle  down  a  bit,  maybe  maybe  to  14,   who  the  hell  knows.  So,  in  terms  of   Bitcoin,  this  is  the  buy  zone.  This  is   where  I  would  expect  Bitcoin  to  bottom   out  within  the  coming  within  the  coming   uh  quarters.  Uh  likely  towards  the  end   of  the  summer,  we're  going  to  see  a  nice   fantastic  bottom  for  Bitcoin.  That's   that.  Uh  let's  see.  We  discussed  this,   we  discussed  this.  Let's  go  into  some   other  stuff.  You  have  the  uh  man  R  Paul   does  he  still  have  people  following   because  either  I  thought  everyone  was   already  in  in  bankruptcy   but  but  apparently  not  apparent  if  guys   if  you  follow  R  Paul  let  us  know  I  mean   apparently  still  some  people  are  not  in   bankruptcy   some  people  are  still  hopeful  still  you   know  V-shaped  recovery  he  is  saying  that   we're  going  to  go  to  160  I  mean  I  guess   soon  we're  going  to  be  in  agreement  with   R  Paul  because  as  we  enter  buy  zone  and   as  we  bought  out.  I  I'm  also  going  to  be   bullish.  So,  I  guess  soon  we're  going  to   be  on  the  same  side  again.  But  I  think   just  since  October,  it's  been  very  bad   for  many  many  people.  Uh  listening  to   like  business  cycle  and  stuff  he  says.   But  anyway,  let's  see  what  he  says.   >> The  map  as  NASDAQ  did  perfectly.  Bitcoin   today  should  be  at  160,000.   So  that's  the  discount  we  are  to  fair   value  according  to  liquidity.  So  that   was  the  feature  of  the  year.  It  was  a   technical  year.  Anyway,  so  feature  of   the  year,  liquidity,  man,  just  keep  it   simple.  Bertrren  is  bare  trend.  It  is   what  it  is.  Liquidity,  this  and  that.   Maybe  it's  going  to  work,  maybe  not.   Again,  just  a  reminder,  the  reason  why   we  don't  really  follow  liquidity  and  all   of  that  too  much  when  it  comes  to   trading,  like  basing  your  decision  on   trading  is  because  it  can  take  a  few   months,  it  can  take  half  a  year.  In  that   amount  of  time,  your  altcoins  go  down   90%.  Okay?  That's  why  as  a  crypto  trader   looking  at  macro  for  trading  decisions,   it's  not  too  good.  Why?  Because   theoretically  it  is  correct.  Liquidity   should  drive  the  prices  up.  Practically   if  that  has  a  lag  of  six  months,  you  are   wrecked.  You're  destroyed.  Look  at   people  since  October.  Those  that  didn't   derisk,  they're  destroyed.  They're   destroyed.  So  R  Paul  again,  he's  going   to  say  he  was  fully  correct.  At  some   point,  we're  going  to  pump  towards  the   end  of  the  year.  I  will  tell  you  to  be   bullish.  Uh  he  will  tell  you  to  be   bullish.  She's  going  to  say  I  was  fully   correct  and  then  what's  left  afterwards   is  your  portfolio  and  your  wreckage  and   no  one  cares  about  that  because  now  he   was  fully  correct  you  know  apparently   was  fully  you  understand  or  you  don't   understand  I  mean  sometimes  people  don't   understand  people  say  Ivan  you  don't   understand  liquidity  you  don't   understand  the  fundamentals  I  want  you   understand  the  fund  you  don't  understand   liquidity  cycle  I  mean  you  don't   understand  the  business  cycle  I  business   cycle  you  don't  get  it  let  know  do  you   understand  or  no  guys  uh  we  have  a  few   more  stuff  then  we'll  go  to  Q&A  I  would   love  love  love  to  get  straight  into  Q&A.   Uh  we  need  to  discuss  the  tax.  There  is   a  lot  of  problems  guys  in  the   Netherlands.  So  as  you  know  it  is  now   yeah  passed  36%  tax  on  realiz  gains  and   plan  B  is  saying  the  following.  Make  no   mistakes  this  is  not  government   stupidity.  This  is  what  the  Dutch   majority  wants.  It's  what  the  majority   voted  for.  The  majority  wants  more   migration  and  less  investors   entrepreneurs.  And  you  know  to  be  fair  I   can  kind  of  agree  with  that  because  the   same  thing  I  remember  when  I  lived  in   Sweden  this  was  already  years  ago  but   man  it  was  hard  to  find  people  on  the   same  wavelength.  Yes,  of  course  there   are  entrepreneurs.  You  guys  who  are   watching  this  crypto  people,  I  mean,   we're  on  the  same  wavelength.  When  you   speak  to  average  Joe  or  like  a  average   uh  woman,  so  to  speak,   it  is  kind  of  like  a  plan  B  saying  is  a   lot  about  like  their  their  mindset  is   that  the  rich  people,  they  have  too  much   and  uh  everything  bad  that's  happening,   it's  okay.  It's  okay  because  uh  this  guy   that  that  did  something  horrible  some   some  physical  violence  he  is  the  victim   of  the  situation.  So  we  should  be   mindful  should  be  mindful.  Yes  he  may   have  done  this  and  this  and  this  but   look  at  how  great  guy  he  is.  He  is  just   a  victim  of  the  circumstance.   Yes  he  did  horrible.  He  did  something   horrible.  Maybe  he  ended  lives  of   someone  something.  But  look  at  how  great   like  fluffy  guys  he  just  victim  of  the   circumstance.  And  this  rich  GUY  TAX  TAX   TAX  TAX  PRIVILEGED  MFER.  EXACTLY.  So  I   can  feel  I  can  really  feel  that  maybe  it   is  like  everything  is  okay  like  by   design.  You  know  sometimes  it's  easy  to   think  that  we  are  in  our  crypto  bubble   in  Twitter  that  it's  kind  of  consensus.   You  know  when  we  are  shocked  by  the   wealth  taxes  or  by  the  unrealized  gains   taxes  it's  easy  to  think  when  we  are  in   crypto  Twitter  that  everyone  thinks  like   that  because  uh  on  crypto  Twitter   everyone  thinks  like  that.  So  it's  easy   to  it's  easy  to  think  that  the  entire   society  thinks  like  that  but  in  reality   I  mean  most  people  are  actually  cheering   on  this  kind  of  stuff.  So  yeah  maybe  it   is  how  it  is  supposed  to  be.  I  mean  you   have  democracy.  Here's  the  problem  with   uh  how  the  west  works.  When  if  you  have   any  kind  of  success  in  your  career,  you   really  need  to  know  that  if  I'm  a   politician,  let's  say  I'm  a  politician.   I'm  just  a  pragmatic  politician.  If  I   take  $5,000   from  you  and  I  give  $1,000  to  five  guys,   what  has  happened?  Think  about  it.  What   has  happened  here?  I've  lost  you  as  a   voter,  but  I  gained  five  voters.  Let's   say  my  ambition  is  to  rule  the  country   like  I'm  a  logical  rational  actor.  Okay,   that's  exactly  what  I  would  be  doing.   I'm  not  even  blaming  them  because  that's   like  if  I  would  be  politician,  man,  I   would  be  freaking  socialistic  like  like   hell.  Like  hell.  If  my  goal  is  power,   man,  it's  easy.  It's  one  vote,  one   person.  So,  don't  blame  the  Don't  blame   the  player.  Don't  blame  the  player.   Blame  the  game.  One  vote,  one  person   give  you  your  money.  I  have  the  right  to   take  your  money.  Just  make  a  simple  law,   some  piece  of  paper.  I  just,  you  know,  I   I  uh  swept  my  donut  with  this  thing,  but   it  says  I  take  your  money.  And  this  10   guys,  I  give  it  to  them.  So,  one  vote,   one  person.  Like,  what's  the  problem?   That's  how  the  game  works.  One  vote,   one,  okay,  10  guys  here,  you  don't  like   me,  it's  fine.  I  don't  care.  Go  on   Twitter.  Go  cry.  Go,  go,  go,  go,  go.   Write  on  Twitter.  Make  a  live  stream.   Make  a  live  stream  on  YouTube  how  you   don't  like  wealth  tech.  Go  go go  go go   go  guys.  Welcome.   Love  it.  Love  it.  Love  it.  So  guys,  I   mean  it  is  what  it  is.  Be  pragmatic  as   well.  The  only  you  cannot  change  it  with   voting.  It's  one  vote  one  person.  You   have  you  have  one.  You  have  one.  You   cannot  grow  it.  You  have  one.  You  you   you  have  one.  One  vote  one  one  person.   It's  it's  very  bad  system  for  you.   I  mean  honestly  guys  if  I  would  be   politician  I  would  be  freaking   socialist.  We  would  be  distributing   wealth  like  there's  no  tomorrow.   We  will  be  redistributing  like  a  hell.   Is  it  good  good  for  the  country?  You   think  you  think  they  care?  Who  the  hell   cares?  Let's  distribute  guys.  That's  how   we  make  number  go  up.  Easy,  easy,  easy.   Guys,  that's  it.  Let's  go  to  Q&A   questions.  Answer  debates.  Guzman,  you   have  to  leave.  You  have  to  leave.  Uh  you   see  yourself  there.  There's  no  change.   There's  no  change  is  going  to  happen.   You  have  to  leave.  You  have  to  figure   something  out.  Guzman,  please  confirm   that  you're  leaving.  Netherlands  and  you   have  a  plan  because  um  here's  the  thing   um  obviously  people  with  a  brain   understand  that  everything  is  going  down   very  quickly  like  the  ship  is  going  down   so  if  you  are  early  you  can  leave  quite   okay  if  you're  late  you're  going  to  have   Berlin  wall  financial  Berlin  wall  maybe   even  physical  Berlin  wall  at  some  point   I  mean  it  happened  in  Germany  Germans   put  in  a  big  fat  Berlin  wall  in  the  last   century  because  people  were  leaving  too   too  much  so  if  you  think  about  yourself   you  need  to  leave  before  like  the  the   living  is  too  much.  If  leaving  is  too   much,  they  put  wall  if  they  uh  if  if   otherwise  it's  by  the  way  I  I  just   thought  about  more  things  to  to  play   you.  Uh  look  here.  So  so  basically  if   you're  early,  you're  going  to  be  okay.   If  you're  late,  you're  going  to  be   locked  in.  Uh  look  here.  Um  there  there   is  some  sense  coming  from  some  Latin   American  politicians  trying  to  tell  the   socialists  that  the  wealth  tax  is  bad,   but  they  don't  care.  Look  here.  I  I  I   think  this  is  illustration  what  I  just   told  you.  So,  when  you  run  for   president,   are  you  going  to  impose  a  wealth  tax  or   a  billionaire's  tax?   >> I  don't  think  that  um  I  I  don't  think   that  anyone  and  that  we  don't  have  to   wait  for  any  one  president  to  impose  a   wealth  tax.  I  think  that  it  needs  to  be   done  expeditiously.   >> Okay.   I  mean,  she  knows  the  game.  Don't  hate   the  player.  Don't  hate  AOC.  It  is  the   game.  She  understands.  wealth  tax.  You   have  one  guy,  you  lose  one  guy,  you  get   a  thousand.  Uh,  now  this  lazy  is  trying   to  warn  them,  but  uh,  who  cares?  No  one   cares.   >> You  have  the   >> guys,  by  the  way,  you're  you  cannot  have   like  this.  This  don't  have  like  this   >> a  recipe  that  many  Latin  American   countries  uh  applied  many  many  times.   That  is  some  some  relief  in  the  short   term,  but  end  up  being,  you  know,  a  a   tragedy  for  the  future.  It's  like  a   public  expenditure,  huge  public   expenditure.  price  controls  sometimes   wealth  tax  and  you  end  up   >> yeah  so   you  understand  they  know  they  know  it's   bad  that  that's  the  thing  they  know  it's   bad  it's  it's  tested  and  tried  they  know   it's  bad  for  sure  they  know  it's  bad  but   it's  one  vote  1%  how  you  get  the  vote   very  easy  now  I  want  to  play  something   else  what  was  it  what  was  it  what  was  it   I  want  to  play  something  else  let  me  let   me  see  if  I  can  find  it   because  there  there  was  a  lady   saying  crazy  things  in  uh  in  Munich,  I   guess,  or  somewhere.  I  I  know  I  liked   it.  Let  me  let  me  just  find  it.  And   while  I'm  looking  for  it.  Oh,  yeah.   Here,  here,  here,  here,  here,  here.  Holy   crap,  guys.  Holy  crap.  Yeah,  I  find  it.   I  found  this  was  happening  also  on  a   global  level.  I  think  it  has  to  do  with   this  one  vote,  one  person  situation   also.  Look  here.  We  actually  have  a   beautiful  opportunity  in  front  of  us   with  the  United  States  being  such  an   unmititigated  disaster  as  it  currently   is.  Okay.  So  there  is  the  opportunity   and  within  that  opportunity  I  would   suggest  three  things.  The  first  one  we   have  to  have  a  global  asset  registry.  We   have  to  know  who  has  the  freaking  money.   And  if  they  don't  want  you  to  know  that   they  have  the  money  or  how  much  money   they  have,  chances  are  they  got  it  from   somewhere  they  shouldn't  have  gotten  it   from  and  they're  spending  it  on  some   they  shouldn't  be  spending  it  from.   Did  you  hear  that?  I  mean,  this  is  the   kind  of  stuff  they're  discussing  at  the   IMF.  Guys,  did  you  hear  that?  This  is   the  best  Bitcoin  ad.  And  by  the  way,  the   best  Monero  and  Zcash  ad  I've  ever  seen,   man.  I  mean  again  people  say  uh  Ivan   sometimes  you  say  spicy  things  but  this   lady  I  would  rather  have  her  do  cookies   than  do  e  economic  policy  people  say   Ivan  this  is  myogenistic  and  not  really   because  sunumis  I  don't  want  sun  lumis   to  do  cookies  I  want  her  to  do  bitcoin   legislation  she's  very  very  good  but  in   this  case  guys  we  need  to  be  selectively   maybe  a  bit  misogenic   because  what  the  hell  is  she  saying   what  is  she  talking  about   >> asset  registry.  We  have  to  know  who  has   the  freaking  money.  And  if  they  don't   want  you  to  know  that  they  have  the   money  or  how  much  money  they  have,   chances  are  they  got  it  from  somewhere   they  shouldn't  have  gotten  it  from  and   they're  spending  it  on  some  they   shouldn't  be  spending  it.   >> Wow.  Wow.  Holy  crap,  guys.   Wow.   Wow.  I  love  it.  Like  this  is  I  think  she   made  the  best  Bitcoin  ad  and  crypto  ad   ever.  who  has  the  freaking  money.  And  if   they  don't  want  you  to  know  that  they   have  the  money  or  how  much  money  they   have,  chances  are  they  got  it  from   somewhere  they  shouldn't  have  gotten  it   from  and  they're  spending  it  on  some   they  shouldn't  be  spending  it.  So,   number  one,  a  global  asset  registry.   Number  two,  we  have  to  facilitate  an   international  conversation  about  what  is   enough   and  that  if  there  is  a  number  that  is   enough,  there  is  a  number  that  is  too   much.   >> Holy  crap,  guys.  I  mean  this  mindset   guys  it  makes  me  very  scared  for  the   west  guys  it  makes  me  very  very  scared   for  the  west  because  okay  what  is  enough   what  is  too  much  so  who's  going  to  get   the  funds  then  the  government  okay  you   know  that  is  trial  and  tested  when  you   have  the  government  taking  money  from   so-called  you  know  people  that  have  too   much  too  much  where  does  where  does  the   money  go  you  think  it  goes  to  citizens   it  is  a  brezing  ground  for  corruption   like  there's  no  tomorrow  if  you  have  a   lot  of  redistribution  corruption  is   going  to  correlate  exactly  so  Okay,  you   take  away  from  this  guy.  Let's  say  you   take  away  from  Elon.  He  made  all  of  the   companies.  You  take  away  his  shares   because  most  of  the  value  that  net  worth   is  in  the  shares.  Who  you  going  to  give   it  to?  The  government.  Okay.  What   happened  to  Ronald  Reagan?  I  love  Ronald   Reagan.  What  happened?  What  happened  to   the  that  spirit  American  spirit  of   Ronald  Reagan?  You  know,  the  scariest   thing  you  can  hear  is  uh  I'm  here  from   the  government  and  I'm  here  to  help.  I   love  it.  I  mean,  this  kind  of  stuff.   This  is  true  like  America.  True  America.   Now,  this  is  some  kind  of  uh  banana   republic.  I  don't  know  what  it  is.   >> We  believe  that  money  becomes  power.  And   when  power  threatens  your  democracy,  you   have  to  take  away  power  and  the  only  way   to  take  away  that  power  is  by  taking   >> Is  this  Stalin?  Is  is  exactly  what  Len   would  be  proud.  Isn't  it  crazy?  The  US   won  the  Cold  War  but  still  lost  it.   I  guess  I  think  ideologically  I  think   ideologically   uh  communism   will  win.  I  mean  you  see  yourself   ideologically  it's  it's  winning  man.   It's  winning.  You  don't  have  to  fight   militarily  or  anything.  Just   ideologically   this  is  the  comrade  the  I  don't  know   what  she  what  her  name  is  grandma.  She's   exact  saying  exactly  everything  correct   >> away  the  money  and  the  only  way  to  take   away  the  money  is  taxation.   So  number  three,  forget  progressivity.   All  right.  Forget  progressivity.  Unless   by  progressivity  you   >> Karen  Sten.  Exactly.  Karen  Sten.   >> You  mean  taxation  that  makes  people  less   rich.   >> See,  I  mean  they  want  to  make  you  less   you  make  money.  You  you  need  to  become   less  rich.  Okay.   >> This  is  not  about  a  2%  wealth  tax  when   somebody's  getting  a  higher  return  than   that.  I  because  see  the  money  is  going   to  go  somewhere.  It's  going  to  go   somewhere.  It's  going  to  go  from  Elon  to   to  her  to  her  friends.  You  think  it's   going  to  go  to  you  to  your  uh  housing   development  in  Bronx  or  what's  this   supposed  to  go?  It's  not  going  to  go  to   Bronx,  guys.   It's  not  going  to  Bronx  or  what  else?   You  know,  Compton.  Straight  out  of   Compton.  You  guys  know  that?  I  just  know   the  saying.  Straight  out  of  Compton.  I  I   don't  even  know  where  the  hell  it  is.   But  yeah,  I  mean,  this  is  the  problem,   guys.  It's  not  going  to  go  to  freaking   Bronx  or  Compton  or  where  the  hell   people  envision  it's  going  to  go.  It's   not  going  to  go  there.  It's  going  to  go   to  politician.  Whenever  there  is   socialism,  money  goes  to  politician.   Whenever  there  is  socialism,  your   politician  has  more  money  than  the   biggest  business  owner.  Okay.   Guys,  crazy.

Let's   go.   The  old  empire  countries  are  doing  this   not  out  of  ideology  or  for  votes.  They   must  do  this  because  the  riches  of   colonialism  simply  run  out.   Uh  and  capitalism  accumulate  all  the   wealth.  Uh  uh  no   hard  disagree   hard  disagree.  Capitalism  accumulate  all   the  wealth.  I  never  really  understood   because  uh  see  this  is  the  problem.  This   is  the  problem.   Uh  because  I  I  sense  a  bit  of  negativity   towards  capitalism.  I  don't  like  that.  I   don't  like  that.  Please  don't  attack   capitalism  on  the  show.  This  is  a  cap   capitalistic  show.  We  we  are  here  for   free  market  and  capital.  Here's  the   problem,  guys.  Everyone  I  know  in  I'm   just  saying  from  a  university.   Any  everyone  who  wanted  to  get  rich  put   their  mind  to  it.  Work  hard.  not  just   pretend  that  you  know  many  people  want   to  get  rich   but  really  worked  hard  became  obsessed   most  of  them  made  it  most  of  them  made   it  okay  most  of  them  made  it  now  there   are  also  many  pretenders  I  I  know  many   some  you  know  one  want  toreneurs   uh  many  of  them  obviously  did  not  but  if   you  actually  like  put  your  work  and  um   and  mind  to  it  you  can  become  rich  and   you  have  high  probability  of  But  okay,   very  high.  So  I  don't  like  when  people   attack  capitalism.  I  would  rather  have   the  current  system  because  uh  I  mean  uh   I'm  releas  by  very  soon  I  will  release  a   book  about  my  story  about  the  mechanical   rules  is  coming.  It's  a  bit  of  a  teaser.   I  will  tell  you  my  story  in  that  book.  I   mean  basically  I  grew  up  in  Swedish   ghetto  like  you  know  in  the  ghetto   uh  concrete  ghetto  very  multicultural.   It  was  very  bad.   So  I'm  an  example.  Uh  there  are  many   many  others.  I  mean  everyone  I  know  who   really  wanted  to  become  rich  they  put   their  mind  their  mind  to  it.  So  there's   no  like  no  evil  capitalism  stopping  you   stopping  you.  Okay  there there's  no  such   thing  there's  no  such  thing  is  there   inequality  there  is  inequality  but   that's  because  just  how  human  society   works.  I  mean  most  people  don't  want  to   work  hard.  Uh  mo  most  people  don't  uh  I   mean  it  is  what  it  is.  How  many  people   work  hard  uh  to  really  you  know  try  to   change  their  their  situation?  I'm  just   looking  back  like  when  I  was  in   university,  how  many  people  really   worked  hard?  I  I  don't  know  man.  I  don't   know  man.  And  then  people  say,  but  I   there  are  many  people  who  work  hard  but   don't  make  a  lot  of  money.  It's  true.   But  it's  it's  all  about  how  you  you  know   set  up  from  the  beginning.  How  you  set   up  from  the  beginning.  Of  course,  if  you   repeat  the  same  thing  over  and  over   again,  working  hard  does  not  change  the   outcome.  If  you  really  want  to  change   the  outcome,  you  need  to  look  more   holistically.  You  can  work  hard  digging   a  digging  a  hole  in  the  ground.  It's  not   going  to  make  you  rich.  and  you  can  fill   it  up  again  and  you  can  work  hard  again   to  dig  it  up  again.  So  obviously  working   hard  is  is  not  the  only  criteria  but   working  hard  and  like  on  the  strategy   not  just  you  know  working  hard  day  in   day  out  work  hard  wake  up  early  go  in   commute  day  in  day  out  that's  not  not   going  to  help  you  or  anyone  but  working   hard  on  like  the  the  holistic  like  the   strategy  what  am  I  supposed  to  do  to  get   the  money  because  the  money  guys  they're   printing  trillions  of  it  okay  there's   abundance  of  money  and  working  hard  not   just  you  know  I  work  every  day  I  work   that's  That's  working  hard,  but  it's  not   what  I'm  speaking  about  holistic  like  on   a  big  picture  level  to  get  yourself  out   of  the  freaking  hole.  And  uh  strategic   like  working  on  strategic,  what  skills  I   need,  uh  what  do  I  need  to  do?  What   industry  I  need  to  be  in?  Uh  man,  I  most   people  that  I  know  that  that  really  put   their  mind  to  it,  they  have  made  it.   It's  possible  to  make  it.  Absolutely.   It's  possible,  man.  It's  possible.  By   the  way,  big  shout  out  to  Wigor.  Big   shout  out  to  Wixor.   Wigs  are  saying,  \"I've  been  with  you   since  2018.  I'm  not  against  capitalism,   but  it's  a  simple  fact.  It's  not  a   constant.  It  involves  and  and   unfortunately  devours  I  mean  you  you  you   can  speak  about  also  you  see  many  people   confuse  maybe  this  is  what  you  mean.   Many  people  confuse  capitalism  and   central  banking  because  central  banking   is  central  planning  not  really   capitalism.  So  when  people  say  that  you   know  the  interest  rates,  central  bank  is   uh  printing  inflation  that's  not   capitalism.  Maybe  that's  where  a  lot  of   confusion  is  because  people  think  that   the  US  equals  to  capitalism  but  then  you   have  central  banker  uh  having  central   planning  they  they  they  centrally  plan   the  economy  and  there  I  would  agree   there  there  is  a  lot  of  wealth   redistribution  happening  there  with  the   printer  who  gets  the  money  first  and   that's  unfair  that's  very  very  unfair   but   don't  turn  into  Venezuela  that's  my  only   message  to  everyone  in  the  west  it's  uh   yeah  exactly  Canianism  and  capitalism  is   different.  It's  different.  It's   different.  It's  different.   Mac  Mini  plus  open  claw  equal  money.   Maybe  h  not  really  not  really.  So  with   AI,  like  the  guy's  asking,  should  I  buy   back  mini  and  use  open  claw  this  AI   agent?  So  AI  can  help  you  execute   something  that  you  have  in  mind  faster,   but  you  still  need  to  decide  what  to   execute  on,  what  to  build.  you  still   need  to  uh  have  the  basic  skills  I  would   say  to  understand  what  else  to  even  do   because  okay  everyone  has  AI  now  uh   where  where  are  all  the  daily   billionaires  the  they  they  don't  exist   instead  if  you  already  are  good  at  what   you're  doing  AI  can  make  you  more   efficient  uh  and  maybe  that's  the  uh   confirmation  of  the  fact  that  AI  will   not  really  like  replace  everyone  jobs  it   will  replace  some  job  I  mean  when  it   comes  to  legal  when  it  comes  to   copyright  like  there  are  many  jobs  that   probably  are  not  needed.  But  if  you're   good,  let's  say  you're  like  a  freaking   you're  you're  amazing  lawyer,  AI  will   make  your  job  easier.  Like  you  now  you   don't  need  like  five  assistants  that  dig   through  all  of  the,  you  know,   literature.  Now  AI  can  do  it.  And  like   but  what  about  hallucination?  Listen,   it's  it's  not  2023  anymore.  It's  not   2023.  And  Claude  and  Anthropic  in   particular  are  going  after  business  use   cases  where  obviously  hallucinations  are   their  first  priority.  So  just  like  when   people  complain  about  crypto  it's  never   going  to  work  it's  too  expensive  now   most  crypto  is  super  cheap  look  at  the   in  terms  of  fee  speaking  about  the  fee   here  look  at  Solana  look  at  like  most   blockchains  have  very  very  low  fee  they   have  instant  uh  confirmation  uh  so  the   same  thing  is  with  AI  so  if  you're  good   at  something  it's  going  to  make  you  even   more  powerful  but  if  you  don't  know  what   to  do  it's  not  like  AI  is  you  know  just   going  to  give  you  money  out  of  nowhere   so  you  need  to  you  need  to  know  what  the   hell  you're  doing  I  mean  it  is  what  it   is  you  need  to  know  what  the hell  doing   and  if  you're  good  then  now  you  can   level  yourself  up.  So  probably  the  gap   here  is  going  to  be  big  between  people   that  are  not  good  they  not  going  to  get   any  clients  and  people  who  are  very  good   they're  going  to  have  maybe  even  more   clients  like  their  companies  are  going   to  be  even  more  valuable.   So  yeah,  that's  that.   Eric,  I'm  using  AI  a  lot  nowadays,  so  to   speed  up  my  work,  but  it  also  made  it   harder  because  of  shorter  attention  span   to  things.  Uh  I  mean,  you  kind  of  need  a   lot  of  attention  with  AI  to  be  fair.   It's  uh   uh  to  me  I  I  I  actually  have  vice  versa.   I  mean  to  to  me  it's  actually  that  you   need  to  have  more  attention  because  now   like  it  just  does  things  so  quickly.  So   you  need  to  like  use  your  brain  a  bit   faster  to  figure  out  what's  next  whether   it  comes  to  you  know  the  strategy  when   it  comes  to  implementation  like  it  just   can  do  things  quickly.  So  your  brain   needs  to  actually  work  harder.  Isn't   that  isn't  that  crazy?  AI  actually  makes   your  brain  work  harder  because  it  can   help  you  to  cross  off  the  to-do  list   quicker.  So  then  it's  up  to  you  to   figure  out  the  strategy  next.  Like  what   are  you  doing?  Okay.  You  want  the   landing  page?  Done.   Okay.  What  what's  next?  How  people  going   to  come  to  land?  What  they  going  to   click  there?  What  they  what  they  going   to  Okay.  You  want  online  store?  Done.   Okay.   Online  store  store  alone  will  not  make   you  rich.  Like  you  see  strategy.  Okay.   Promotion.  What  you  need?  Okay.  You  want   email  sequence?  Done.  Okay.  Is  it  good   email  sequence?  like  you  still  need  to   figure  out  like  it  can  do  anything  but   you  need  to  use  your  brain  even  faster   now  like  even  more  because  it  can  do   anything  but  now  okay  is  it  is  it  really   what  we  needed  is  it  exactly  that's   going  to  drive  the  KPI  so  I  I  think  it   it  puts  like  even  more  pressure  on   thinking  because  before  you  make  one   strategic  decision  then  you  know  takes   weeks  to  implement  okay  either  you   implement  yourself  or  you  are  a  team  but   uh  you  can  coast  okay   nothing  to  do.  You  wait  for  it  to  play   out  and  now  it's  more  okay.  Do  this   done.  But  that  alone  is  not  it  does  not   equal  money.   Eric,  exactly.  Your  brain  needs  to  work   harder  creating  AI  fatigue  in  a  lot  of   people.  Yeah,  that's  true.  That's  true.   I  I  can  imagine  that.   But  I  think  with  AI,  we  we  need  to  uh   we're  seeing  it  already,  but  we  need  to   calm  down  a  bit  with  all  of  this.  you   know  AI  did  this,  AI  did  that  because   what's  the  actual  output  there  there  is   a  lot  of  hype  on  social  media  at  least   it  was  during  the  last  few  months  I   think  now  it's  a  bit  calmer  like  last   few  months  it's  actually  calmer  but   before  that  it  was  a  lot  no  now  claude   can  do  this  now  they  can  but  okay  what's   the  KPI  that  that's  going  to  solve  well   what  is  the  KPI  I  think  that's  what  you   know  where  AI  kind  of  hits  a  wall   because  turns  out  you  still  need  a  human   with  a  brain  to  to  use  it  it's  a  tool   it's  a  tool  so  yeah  it  cannot   do  an  end  toend  thing  to  drive  your  KPI.   You  still  need  human  to  drive  the  KPI.   Let's  say  your  business  has  KPI  to  grow   revenue  10%  this  year.  You're  a  big   corporation.  You  want  to  grow  revenue   10%.   AI  cannot  do  that,  man.  It  can  give  you   a  plan,  but  uh  it  doesn't  have  the   experience  you  have.  It  doesn't  have  so   probably  going  to  going  to  be  bad.  So,   you  need  to  review  it.  So,  you  still   need  to  have  strategic  responsibility   >> uh  for  what  is  happening.  Will  it  be   better  in  the  future?  potentially  but   the  thing  is  the  yeah  AI  is  general   purpose  does  have  your  exact  experience   if  you  write  down  like  everything  you've   been  through  in  life  maybe  it  can  do   that  but  uh  the  the  the  current  state  of   AI  now  is  that  it's  not  strategic  it  is   very  good  at  execution  but  what  is   execution  worth  in  today's  day  and  age   with  AI  it's  not  worth  a  lot  you  need  to   be  strategic  so  it  is  kind  of  the  age  of   the  idea  guy  I  guess  you  know  in  the   past  the  idea  guy  was  the  um  was  the   person  in  the  startup  who  say  you  have  a   technical  co-founder  and  non-technical.   The  idea  guy  was  valued  a  bit  less  than   the  tech  guy.  I  think  that's  flipping  a   bit  now  because  the  idea  guy  can   actually  do  a  lot  himself  and  uh  he   could  reach  significant  milestones  on   his  own  as  well.  He  still  needs  to  know   how  to  use  AI,  how  to  do  but  yeah  that's   an  interesting  flip  that  that's  actually   very  interesting.  So  if  you're  a  tech   person  is  just  um  yeah  I  think  that's   where  the  danger  is  the  tech  guys.  I'm  a   tech  guy  myself  but  uh  I  I'm  I'm  not   sure  I  would  be  a  tech  guy  if  I  started   from  scratch  now  because  knowing  what  I   know  with  with  like  it's  at  the  same   time  to  really  use  AI  in  a  nice  way  you   still  need  a  bit  of  like  basic  tech.  So   you  need  to  I  would  say  you  know  get   some  basic  education  in  tech  know  some   basic  program  so  you  so  at  least  you  can   use  A  yeah  you  understand  what  else  is   happening  front  and  back  end  security   like  basic  stuff  don't  don't  like  get   too  fanatic  don't  don't  go  like  super   PhD  in  some  computer  science  because  u   the  leverage  is  more  on  the  strategy   it's  more  on  you  knowing  how  to  market   how  to  sell  uh  I  mean  that's  where  where   the  value  is  anyway  I  digress  guys  so  I   don't  know how  the  hell  we  got  into  it   but  that's  the  good  thing  with  the  Q   Q&A.  We  can  we  can  go  on  very  very  big   tangent  and  let  me  know  if  you  like  that   or  if  you  don't  like  it.  Maybe  you  guys   want  me  to  just  uh  look  at  charts.  We   can  do  that  also.   Yo,  Wigzor,  I  know  you  already  touched   on  it,  but  isn't  um  a  6050  range  a  more   likely  zone  than  for  even  for  soul?  Um   let's  see.  Let's  see.  Let's  see.  Let's   see.   Um   50  60   Yeah,  I  mean  it  could  get  a  bit  of   support  here.  Maybe  you  mean  this  like   which  one?  You  mean  this  or  or  or  which   one?   Or  you  mean  it's  going  to  get  a  bit  of   support  here?  Maybe  you  mean  with  this?   It  could  it  could  but  I  mean  see  the   target  is  is  a  is  a  target.  That's   meaning  that  it  doesn't  have  to  go  all   the  way  there.  It  could  stop  maybe  at   50.  Who  the  hell  knows?  But  is  a  target   is  a  target.  It's  a  very  high  likelihood   target.  Doesn't  have  to  go  all  the  way   there.  Let's  say  you  love  salt.  You   don't  have  to  be  greedy  waiting  waiting   for  it  to  come  back  to  30.  Exactly.  On   30,  you  just  have  if  it  comes  to  30,   it's  best  for  everyone.  It's  best  for   the  for  the  bulls  because  they  can  buy   here  on  a  very  crazy  I  mean  this  support   you  see  it's  been  like  months  and  months   like  this  support  here  was  built  by   generations  by  your  granddad,  grand  like   everyone  was  building  the  support.  So   for  bulls  is  good  because  if  you  buy   here  you  know  it's  fantastic  like  it's   such  a  nice  entry.  Uh,  I  mean,  let's  say   Bitcoin  bounces  at  like  this  one.  I   mean,  yeah,  it  can  definitely  do  that,   guys.  Everything  is  probabilistic.  It   can  definitely  do  that.  Maybe  you  could   even,  but  you  say  50.  Yeah.  I  mean,  I   guess  you  mean  this  one.  Could  it  do  it?   Yeah,  but  it's  it's  going  to  be  a  less  u   good  entry.  So,  I  I  would  I  would  not   buy  at  5060  if  the  trend  is  bare.  I   would  not  do  it.  Then  I  would  just  wait   for  bear  to  for  the  trend  to  turn  bull.   Okay.  I  would  not  buy  here  if  the  trend   is  bare.  I  would  buy  here  if  the  even  if   the  trend  is  bare  at  30  I  would  do  it.   So  that's  maybe  the  only  like  difference   here.  I  don't  think  it's  attractive   enough  to  buy  in  a  bare  uh  trend.  If  it   comes  here  likely  this  thing  is  going  to   be  maybe  at  90  or  something  like  that.   So  I  would  rather  have  that   confirmation.  But  if  it  goes  to  30  guys   here  we're  going  to  be  buying  even  in  uh   in  bar  trend  because  I'm  a  Solana  daily   user.  So  at  this  like  super  nice  price   with  crazy  support  riskreward  is  too   good  man.  It's  too  good.  But  again  it's   probabilistic.  That's  the  first  thing   you  learn  in  bull  mania.  Everything  is  a   probability.  Nothing  is  certain  which   means  that  you  need  position  size.  You   need  you  need  stop  loss.  You  need  to   have  the  full  life  cycle  of  the  trade   figured  out.   Let's  see.  We  are  at  40.  Okay.  Let's   take  one  more  question  and  then  we're   out  of  here.   Uh,  let's  see.   Someone  posting  on  No,  it's  I'm  just  I'm   posting  here  and  on  my  Twitter.   Oh,  yeah.  Let's  check  the  fib.  Let's   check  the  fib.  That's  true.  Let's  check   the  fib.   Man,  my  my  chart  is  uh   let's  check  the  fib  without  the  wicks  on   the  weekly.   It  lines  up  with  this  thing  that  we  just   said.  There  may  be  support  a  bit  here  at   like  50  something.  But  the  thing  is  we   already  went  to  like  67.  So,   and  I  don't  think  that  it's  the  the   bottom  yet.  Why?  Because  the  bare  trend   is  too  strong.  There  is  no  bottom   formation.  Uh  the  reason  I  don't  think   it's  a  bottom  yet  because  there's  no   bottom  formation.  You  need  you  need   quite  a  lot  of  sideways  to  create  a   bottom.  Kind  of  like  we  did  here.  So  the   way  it  looks  now,  this  is  not  a  bottom.   If  it  continues  to  chop  like  this,  we   can  say  maybe  it's  a  bottom.  Now  it's   it's  absolutely  not  a  bottom.  No,  no.   The  way  it  looks  now,  it's  too  few   candles  and  the  candles.  It's  it's  it's   still  clinging  on  onto  the  support.  It's   like  Mufasa  clinging  on  to  the  rock.  And   you  know  what  Mu  Mufasa  does?  He  cannot   hold  on  the  rock  because  the  scar  right   here   is  gonna  put  his  hand  and  just,  you   know,  slap  slap  down.  Okay,   that's  what's  going  to  happen.  Okay,   with  highest  likelihood,  highest   likelihood,  Mufasa  cannot  hold  it.  It's   going  to  be  tough.  The  button  is  going   to  get  pressed  right  here.  And  actually,   not  right  here,  but  right  here,  the  big   flash.  We  never  do  the  small  flash.  I   don't  know  why  you  guys  would  do  the   small  flash.  I  don't  like  the  small   flash.  I  always  use  the  big  flash  to  be   sure  that  the  job  is  finished.  I  I  never   do  job  halfway.  I  don't  want  the  small.   I  only  do  the  big.  So,  the  button  is   going  to  get  pressed  and  boop,  somewhere   there  we're  going  to  go.  It's  going  to   be  exact  30.  I  mean,  who  the  hell  knows?   I  don't  know.  But  it's  a  target.  It's  a   target.  And  that's  helpful.  That's  very   helpful,  guys.  That's  it.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin jelenleg 68,000 dolláron áll, és a piaci hangulat rendkívül borongós, mivel a múlt héthez képest nem történt változás. A befektetők közt sokan shortolják a piacot, mivel a régi érmék folyamatosan csökkennek. A videó figyelmeztet arra, hogy egy újabb jelentős csökkenés várható, amely megerősíti a vásárlási zónába való belépést. A mély pesszimizmus jelzi, hogy a legrosszabb még társadalmi szinten sem zajlott le, és a következő hónapokban bullish fordulat várható. A kutatók szerint a valódi mélypont eléréséhez a reményvesztettség növekedése szükséges, a V-alakú helyreállítás reményének teljes eltűnésével. A videó hangsúlyozza a mechanikai kereskedés jelentőségét a volatilis piacon, ahol a shortolás most a jobb stratégia. A végső konklúzió: a helyi mélypont várhatóan a következő negyedév során alakul ki.",
    "summary_en": "Currently, Bitcoin is priced at $68,000, and the market sentiment is extremely bleak, with no changes from last week. Many investors are shorting the market, particularly due to ongoing declines in altcoins. The video warns of a likely further drop that would signify a new buying zone. The prevailing pessimism suggests the worst has yet to occur socially, indicating a bullish turnaround in the months to come. Researchers emphasize that the real bottom will require a rise in despair, with the disappearance of hope for a V-shaped recovery. The video highlights the importance of mechanical trading strategies in a volatile market, where shorting is currently the preferred approach. The final takeaway is that a local bottom is expected to form in the coming quarters.",
