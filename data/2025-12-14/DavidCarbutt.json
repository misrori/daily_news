        "transcript": "Elon Musk companies don't just support each other, they accidentally create entirely new industries that multiply his advantages in ways nobody predicted. Starlink was supposed to provide internet to underserved areas. But it turns out the same satellite constellation becomes the foundation for orbital data centers that will power XAI's models, which then improves Tesla's autonomous driving and robotics. Every company Elon builds creates unexpected capabilities that the next company exploits, compounding his position at the forefront of technology while competitors remain stuck optimizing single businesses. >> If you're a public company and you're spending a whole bunch of money to build Mars vehicles to go and colonize the Martian surface, uh is that something which your shareholders are going to support? Um, so, uh, I listen, I'm a SpaceX investor. I've held it from the very beginning. I I would love to see it public. I always thought that what Elon was going to do was spin out Starlink and take that public and keep the launch capability. >> That was the conventional wisdom. >> Yeah. I >> think Okay, sorry. >> Yeah. No, I mean like Elon's a smart guy and he's got a million GPUs and so he'll have more AI lawyers than anyone to attack the stupid people that come after them. But I mean serious this is like >> SpaceX, XAI, Tesla all will basically have full AI teams top to bottom. Like you can criticize their strategy, they will just clap back at you. You can sue them for the silly stuff >> and the AI will just clap back. It's a big difference in the way that you can actually run public companies. Yeah, you take SpaceX public and you take X public and Elon, you know, leaps over the trillion dollar mark in terms of personal net worth. Okay. I'm also maybe just to comment quickly. I'm also not sure the historic story that Starlink would spin out and do its own IPO. I I think with the rise of orbital data centers, I I think that muddies the water somewhat in terms of Starlink as pure communication service versus Starlink as a predecessor to orbital data centers and putting compute up there and and not just comms comm's capabilities. So in that sense, I think I could imagine a scenario where orbital data centers are actually pulling all of SpaceX to go public, not just spin-off Starink. >> Yeah. And that's a relatively new part of the conversation. >> That's right. It's very recent. >> Uh I love this competition. You know, it's it's fun. My mission has always been open up space and I, you know, built so many companies on on the space theme and it does the nine-year-old in me so so proud and and gives me such contentment that two of the wealthiest humans on the planet are battling it out to open the space frontier. So, Blue Origin plans to start flying cargo to the moon in early 2026 using its Glenn Heavy Lift rocket. Here comes SpaceX, which becomes the dominant player, and now, you know, the government wants the number two, and it looks like it's going to be Blue Origin, which is uh which is super exciting. Alex, thoughts on this? >> This was basically the plot of season 3 of the television show For All Mankind. >> I love that show. Yeah, >> it's a wonderful, wonderful show. The three-way race, and in the case of season 3, it was a three-way race to Mars. In this case, it's a three-way race between SpaceX, Blue Origin, and China to land humans again on the surface of Mars by 2028 or earlier. And I I think this resumption of a space race which was dormant for 50 plus years and maybe also had collateral downsides for the rest of the economy in terms of overall innovation. It it's coming back to life. We're we're back in the space race again. Starlink accidentally becoming the infrastructure for space-based data centers that power XAI demonstrates how Elon's companies create compounding advantages through unplanned synergies, giving him capabilities competitors can't replicate, even if they matched him in individual domains. When Elon launched Starlink, the goal was providing high-speed internet globally, particularly to rural and underserved areas. The business case centered on communication services competing against terrestrial internet service providers and traditional satellite internet. The satellites launch capability and ground infrastructure were optimized for that mission. No big plan to become the foundation of orbital AI compute infrastructure. But once SpaceX proves they could manufacture thousands of satellites annually, launch them cheaply on reusable rockets and operate them reliably in orbit, the same infrastructure enables an entirely different business that's potentially far more valuable. Orbital data centers solve AI's biggest constraint, which is power and cooling costs on Earth. Training large models requires gigawatts of electricity that strain power grids and generate massive heat, requiring expensive cooling infrastructure. In orbit, solar panels provide unlimited free energy and heat radiates directly into space. The economics transform completely. Starlink already has the satellite manufacturing capability, the launch vehicles, the orbital operations expertise, and the ground station network for data transmission. Converting this infrastructure to support compute workloads rather than just communication requires relatively modest investment compared to building orbital capabilities from scratch. Elon didn't plan this conversion, at least as far as I can tell. But Starlink's existence makes orbital data centers economically viable years earlier than they'd otherwise be. The benefit to XAI compounds the advantage further. Training competitive AI models costs hundreds of millions in compute. OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google all face these costs with no relief in sight. XAI can eventually train models in orbit at dramatically lower operating costs once the infrastructure scales. even a 50% reduction in training costs that translates directly into hundreds of millions of dollars in annual saving. XAI can train larger models, iterate faster, or price services lower than competitors constrained by terrestrial compute economics. The cost advantage doesn't come from being smarter about AI research. It comes from Elon having built SpaceX and Starlink for completely different reasons that happen to solve XAI's biggest expense. I do also think SpaceX will also support other Frontier models launching data centers into space, too. Tesla's autonomous driving and Optimus Robotics benefit from XAI's model improvements, creating another layer of compounding advantage. Tesla needs increasingly sophisticated AI for full self-driving and humanoid robots. Building the AI requires massive training compute. If XAI trains models more cheaply in orbit, Tesla accesses better AI at lower cost than competitors who must pay full terrestrial compute rates. Each company's success accelerates the others in ways that weren't designed but emerge from the ecosystem Elon has built. This pattern of accidental compounding advantages repeats across Elon's company in ways competitors can't replicate. No other CEO operates multiple companies at the frontier of different industries where learning transfers and capabilities compound. What I think is very positive is the fact that the world's wealthiest people are competing to open the space frontier, representing capitalism working exactly as intended, channeling private capital towards humanity's most ambitious goals. Jeff Bezos's Blue Origin plans to start flying cargo to the moon in early 2026, which made them a clear number two in the space race. The US government wanted a number two, so it now looks like it's going to be SpaceX and Blue Origin, then competing with China to land humans again on the surface. In most economic systems throughout history, the wealthiest individuals spent fortunes on palaces, artwork, or extracting more wealth from existing assets. Elon and Bezos are spending tens of billions of dollars building rockets, developing reusable launch systems, and creating infrastructure to make humanity multilanetary. This represents an extraordinary deployment of private capital towards goals that traditionally only governments attempted. The Apollo program costs over $200 billion in today's money funded by taxpayers. SpaceX and Blue Origin are achieving comparable or arguably better capabilities using private wealth, competing for customers rather than the government's taxpayers money. The government benefits by having multiple providers bidding for contracts, driving down prices while reliability improves. This competition delivers better outcomes than the government monopoly approach that dominated aerospace for 50 years after the Apollo program, a period of time where technology and rates of improvement appeared to have stalled. The wealth these men accumulated came from creating massive consumer value through Amazon's e-commerce transformation and Tesla's electric vehicle revolution. Now they're reinvesting billions into space infrastructure that benefits humanity broadly rather than just increasing their consumption. Critics of capitalism often claim billionaires hoard wealth unproductively. But Bezos and Elon demonstrate the opposite. Their wealth funds R&D, employs thousands of engineers, and builds capabilities that makes space accessible to future generations. This is capitalism working as intended, where successful value creation in one domain fuels ambitious projects in another with competition ensuring efficiency and innovation rather than bureaucratic stagnation. Capitalism doesn't always work, but I think it's working pretty well there. Picture this. A potential client searches for what your business offers and your YouTube video appears. Before they've even booked a call, they've built trust with you, turning them into a warm lead. That's why our clients are hitting $100,000 months because YouTube turns attention into authority. If you run a business, book a call and I'll show you exactly how to make this"
