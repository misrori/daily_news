        "transcript": "Elon Musk has just featured in one of the most phenomenal interviews I've ever seen him feature in. He was on top form. Check this out. >> I call AI and robotics the supersonic tsunami. We're in the singularity. When is all white color work gone? Anything short of shaping atoms, AI can do half or more of those jobs right now. >> There's no onoff switch. It is coming and accelerating. >> The transition will be bumpy. you have a solution to this? >> I don't make a bet here. Um, >> China has done an incredible job, >> right? I mean, it's running circles around us. Do you imagine that the US could make that level of investment and commitment >> based on current trends? Uh, China will far exceed the rest of the world in uh AI compute. >> Every major CEO and economist and government leader should be like, what do we do? >> We don't have any system right now to make this go well. But AI is a critical part of making it go well. >> There are three things that I think are important. Truth will prevent AI from going insane. Curiosity, I think, will foster any form of sentience. And if it has a sense of beauty, it will be a great future. >> It's going to be an awesome future. >> So Elon's latest interview is nearly 3 hours long. So to save you guys some time, I pulled out my three favorite clips. But then at the end of this video, I'm going to share with you a bonus clip which honestly had me in absolute stitches. One of my favorite Elon Musk moments ever featured in this interview. So without further ado, here is my third favorite clip from the pod. >> I call AI and robotics the supersonic tsunami. >> Yes. >> Which maybe is a little alarming. >> It's good. That's good. No, because they wake up call. >> This is important for folks to >> to gro because um uh I don't want to leave people depressed. I want people to understand what's coming. So, we're we're basically demonetizing everything. I mean, labor becomes the cost of capex and electricity. AI is basically uh intelligence available uh >> at a dimminimous price. Um uh so you're able to produce almost anything. Things get down to basic costs of materials and electricity, right? Uh so people can have whatever stuff they want, whatever services they need. >> Um it's not when we say universal high income, it sounds like it's a tax and redistribute, but that's not the case. Um >> it's it's I think my my best guess for how this will manifest is that prices will become prices will drop. >> Yeah. >> So as the efficiency of of production or the provision of services drops um prices will drop. I mean you know if prices in in dollar terms are the ratio between the output of goods and services and the money supply. >> Sure. So if your output of goods and services increases faster than the money supply, you will have deflation and or vice versa, you know. So um >> it's a good thing we're growing the money supply so quickly though, >> right? I I Yes. That's why I I I came like let's not worry about growing the money supply won't matter because the output of goods and services actually will grow faster than the money supply. And I think we'll be in this and this is a prediction I think some others have made but um I will add to it which is uh that that I think governments will will actually be pushing to to increase money supply um like like faster. >> Yes. They won't be able to waste the money fast enough which is saying something for >> Isn't it isn't it crazy how close those timelines just randomly worked out. I mean at the rate because we're expanding the national debt not because we're anticipating AI. We were going to do that no matter what. >> Yes. >> And so it's like right on the edge of becoming Argentina. >> But yeah, at the time that productivity So productivity is going to improve dramatically and it is improving dramatically. I I I think we'll see >> I think I think we may see like high double digit uh output of goods and services. We have to be a little careful about how economists measure things. Yeah, GDP is measurable and um >> yeah, it's it I mean there's like my favorite joke I have a few economist jokes that I that that I like, but um maybe my favorite one economist joke is um two economists are going for a walk in in the forest um and they come across a pile of [ __ ] and one economist says, \"I'll pay you 100 bucks to eat a pile of shit.\" >> I've heard this one. This is great. Go ahead. And and so the guy takes 100 bucks and eats the [ __ ] Then they keep walking. They come across another pile of [ __ ] And and the other guy says, \"Okay, I'll give you a hundred bucks to eat a pile of shit.\" See, he gives them 100 bucks. And and then the the guys can say, \"Wait a second. >> We both have the same amount of money. We ate a both ate a pile of [ __ ] >> Oh my god. It sounds >> It's like but we increase the economy by $200. >> This is this is the kind of [ __ ] you get in economics. So, so uh but if you if so if you say like just the output of goods and services um the will be much greater you just need a >> so profitability of companies go through the roof >> at some point but but no but so the question becomes is that taxed by the government is that then taxed by the government and redistributed as some level of income as a U as a UHI or UBI in other words um one of the questions is if in fact this future we hit massive productivity uh and massive profitability because we're dividing by zero. The cost of labor has gone to nothing. The cost of intelligence has gone to nothing and we're still producing products and services faster and faster. So there's more profitability. Someone needs to be buying it and someone needs to be able to have the capital to buy it. Um I mean this is an important question to get to get thought through. >> Yeah. Um, well, one like side recommendation I have is like don't worry about like squirreling money away for uh retirement in like 10 or 20 years. It won't matter. >> No. >> Okay. >> Either either we're not going to be here or >> it it just uh like it's you you won't need to save for retirement. We might dodge a massive inflation crisis purely by accident because AI productivity gains are scaling at the exact moment governments are expanding money supply. Think about what's been happening with the US national debt. They're adding trillions of dollars every year, not because anyone's planning for AI, just because that's what governments do. The US was heading towards an Argentina style currency crisis. Everyone knows it. We're just waiting to see when it would blow up. Then AI shows up and completely changes the equation. When productivity explodes, you can actually print money without causing inflation because you're producing so much more stuff. What Elon's describing is deflation through abundance. Prices drop when goods and services grow faster than the money supply. We're going to have Optimus robots that will cost around three bucks an hour to run once you factor in electricity and maintenance. You've got AI that's got the potential to replace half of white collar work today. You've got autonomous vehicles about to eliminate the cost of transportation. When labor costs approach zero and intelligence becomes nearly free, the cost of making anything drops to basically materials and electricity. That's massive deflation. If money printing had continued for another decade without AI, we could potentially be dealing with some serious levels of inflation. Instead, we're potentially heading to this weird spot where both are happening at once. Governments keep printing and productivity keeps exploding. and they roughly balance out. But what's even crazier is that governments are probably going to end up pushing to print more money, not less. They'll see productivity gains and think they have room to spend. And for once, they might actually be right. So, that's the macro picture, but the competitive dynamic is where things get really interesting. This is my second favorite clip from the pod, and it's a banger. >> When is all white collar work gone? By when? >> Well, there's there's there's a lot of inertia. So even with AI at its current state, um I'd say you're you're pretty close to being able to replace half of all jobs of >> and you know that white color jobs that includes anything like education too. >> Yeah. Mhm. >> So, anything that involves information, um, and anything short of shaping atoms, um, AI can do probably half or more of those jobs right now. >> Sure. >> But there's a lot of inertia. People just keep doing the same the same thing for quite some time. Um, and there actually has to be a a company that makes more use of AI that competes with a company that makes less use of AI, creating a forcing function for increased use of AI, >> right? >> Otherwise, the company that that still has humans do um things that AI can do will still continue to exist. Being a computer used to be a job. So it used to be that a human computer >> would like a computer being a computer was a job. You would compute numbers. Sure. It didn't it didn't used to be a machine. It used to be a job description. Um, and there you can look online there's these pictures of like where they're having like skyscrapers full >> of women copying mostly women copying from ledger to ledger >> and then too but but yeah but pe people um >> um but was a lot of women but there was there were there were just buildings full of uh people just at desks doing calculations. >> Yeah. Um so they'd be calculating the interest in your bank account or um you know some um you know science uh experiment or something like that or what but if you want calculations done uh you people would do it. Um so um now one laptop with a spreadsheet can outperform a skyscraper of several hundred human computers >> right >> of people doing calculations. Um now if even a few cells in that spreadsheet were done manually um you would not be able to compete with a spreadsheet that was entirely a computer. >> Mhm. >> Yeah. What this means is that companies that are entirely AI will demolish companies that are not. >> Right. >> It won't be a contest. >> Agreed. And that flippid. >> Yeah. Just one cell in that >> just one if >> I got to do that. >> Would you want even one cell in your spreadsheet to be manually calculated? >> Yeah. >> That would be the most annoying cell and you're like, \"God damn it.\" >> Yeah. Yeah. >> And and and gets it wrong bunch of the time error, right? >> So this flipping >> flipping the flipping >> um >> are we monetizing hope effectively? >> Yes. >> Not not at this moment. I think we're I think we're at peak I think we're at peak doom for people worried about the future of their jobs. >> We're at peak doom. >> We're going to do that as a t-shirt >> and the mug. >> And the mug monetizable. >> Yes, >> the mug. >> Uh but you have a sol you have a solution to this which is UHI. >> Yes. Everyone can have whatever they want. Companies that run entirely on AI will demolish hybrid companies, not because they build better products, but because their cost structure will be 10 to 100 times more efficient. I absolutely loved this spreadsheet example, and I think it nails it. Half a century to 100 years ago, if you needed calculations done, you hired human computers. Actually, people sitting there doing the maths at desks. There were buildings full of them, copying numbers from ledgers to ledger and running calculations by hand. Then spreadsheet software showed up. One person with a laptop could outperform an entire building of human computers. And if your company still had even one cell that required manual calculation, you'd be at a massive disadvantage. That one cell would slow everything down. It would introduce errors, make you uncompetitive, and be a gigantic bottleneck for you. We're about to see the same thing happen across every industry, but faster. AI can already do about half a white collar work according to Elon Musk today. Anything that's just moving information around, writing reports, analyzing data, customer service, basic legal work, accounting, AI can handle it. Companies that go all in on AI will have cost structures that are absurdly lower than companies still using humans. You're not paying salaries, benefits, office space, HR overhead. You're just paying for compute and electricity. A company with 500 employees spending $50 million per year on labor could do the same work with AI for maybe $2 or3 million in cloud costs. The competitive dynamic is brutal. Two companies selling the same product. One uses AI for everything it can and still uses mostly humans. The AI company can undercut on price by maybe 30 to 40% and still have higher margins. The human run company can't compete. they either switch to AI or they die. And this forcing function is what drives adoption. Companies won't move to AI because they want to be innovative or because they care about efficiency. They'll move to AI because competitors who move first are eating their lunch. And I think the timeline on this is faster than people think. Elon says there's a lot of inertia. People keep doing things the same way even when better options exist. But once a few companies in each industry prove the model works, everyone else has maybe 18 months, 24 months to catch up or they're going to be done. We saw this with e-commerce eating retail. We saw this with streaming eating cable. We're about to see it with AI eating traditional employment. And this cost advantage doesn't just apply to software companies. This is my favorite clip from the podcast and it's a bloody banger. When do you think Optimus will be a better surgeon >> than the best surgeons? How long for that? >> Three years. >> Three years. Okay. >> Yeah. And by the way, >> three years at at scale. >> Yes. All >> more there probably be more Optimus robots that are great surgeons than there are sure >> all surgeons on Earth. >> And the cost of that is the capex and electricity and it works in Zimbabwe. The best surgeon is throughout in the villages throughout Africa or any place on the planet. >> Yeah. Where do you think it'll roll out first? Not the US obviously. >> Um >> here at at the uh Gigafactory. >> Oh yeah. Just do surgery in the >> um >> but that's an important statement in three years time. >> Yeah. >> Um because medicine I mean >> I'm not like absolutely if it's four or five if it's four or five years who cares. That's still an incredible >> statement to make. I mean, good for humanity, right? All of a sudden, you demonetize. >> Okay, here's the thing to understand about like like humanoid robots in terms of the rate of improvement um which is is that the um you you have um three exponentials multiplied by each other. You have an exponential increase in the AI software capability. >> Yeah. >> Exponential increase in the AI chip capability >> um and an exponential increase in the electromechanical dexterity. The usefulness of the humanoid robot is it's those three things multiplied by each other, >> right? >> Um then you have the recursive effect of Optimus building Optimus, >> right? And then you have the shared >> you have a recursive multiplicable triple exponential >> and you have the shared knowledge of all all the experiences. >> Is that literally Optimus building Optimus or is it because you know the >> well not right now but will be the the physical humanoid form factor building the humanoid form as opposed to machine. >> Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I love that. >> But the point machine is usually something kind of like this shape, you know, making something else. >> No, it's just in principle, it's simply a self-replicating thing. >> Yeah. >> Elon, do you know what the number one question you ask a surgeon when you're interviewing them? >> Uh, is this is this a surgeon joke? >> No. It's how many It's how many times do you how many times you do that? >> There's got to be some funny funny jokes. No, it's serious. It's it's it's how many times did you do the surgery this morning? >> It's how many times did you do the surgery this morning or yesterday? It's the it's the number of experiences, right? And so with a shared memory, >> um you know, every optimist surgeon will have seen every possible pertabbation of everything in infrared, in ultraviolet, no not too much caffeine that morning. They didn't have a a fight with their husband or wife. >> Yeah. >> Extreme precision. Yes. >> Um, >> yes. Better than any any probably I'd say if you like put a little margin on it. Better than any human in four years >> who's in plastic surgery >> by 5 years. It's not even close. >> So what what about the simple like just I mean there's a million of these things to figure out. But who's going to have access to the first optimus that does far far better micro surgery than any surgeon on Earth? But you've only manufactured the first 10,000 of them. >> How do you do that? I don't think people understand how many robots there's going to be. >> Yeah. >> Well, there's a window in Saudi said 10 billion by 2040. >> You still on that path? >> Uh that's not that's a low number. >> A low number. >> Wow. >> What's the constraint? What's the uh cuz if they're self-building, you know, >> metal the constraint is metal. >> Yeah. Or lithium or >> Yeah. You got to move the atoms. Um it's just all just supply chain stuff. >> So, but you're I mean there's some right limit. You can't just manufacturing is very difficult. So you got you got to >> you you you it's it's recursive multiplicable triple exponential but but you still need to you still you still have to climb that you know >> selling hope once again I I think your point was medicine is going to be effectively free the best medicine in the world. >> Everyone will have access to medical care that is better than what the president receives right now. Within 10 years, robotic surgeons will make the cost of surgery plummet dramatically while expanding access to quality health care worldwide. This is astonishing. The cost structure for surgery today is insane. A cardiac surgeon in the US makes around $400,000 per year. They work maybe 50 to 60 hours per week. They need years of training, four years of med school, 5 years of residency, two to three years of fellowship. By the time they're actually practicing, they're in their mid-30s and carrying hundreds of thousands worth of student debt. Now, compare that to an Optimus robot. It's predicted to cost around $20,000 to manufacture at scale. It can operate 24/7 at roughly three bucks an hour in electricity and maintenance costs. No salary, no benefits, no malpractice, no insurance, no vacation days. But the real advantage is the shared memory system. Every human surgeon builds experience one case at a time over decades. An Optimus surgeon has instant access to every surgery ever performed by every other Optimus robot worldwide and huge amounts of training data from surgeons as well. A human surgeon might do 300 heart surgeries in their career. An Optimus surgeon effectively has done millions before it even starts. It can see an infrared and ultraviolet. It's got extreme precision. It never had too much caffeine or got into a fight with its spouse or worked a 14-hour shift. The experience gap becomes massive within months of deployment. So what happens to healthare costs? Right now a heart bypass surgery costs $75 to $150,000 in the US. A huge chunk of that is the surgeon fee, anesthesist fees, nursing staff, posttop care, preop. When robots can handle that end to end, you're looking at a gigantic cut in costs. That $100,000 today could end up being around $10,000 for example. And that's assuming hospitals keep their current markup structure. Competition could even drive that lower. Therefore, access to healthcare explodes because you're now not limited by how many surgeons you can train. Right now, there's about one surgeon for every 15,000 people in the US. In rural America, it's way worse. In Africa or Southeast Asia, you might have one surgeon per 100,000 people. With Optimus, you just manufacture more robots. Elon thinks we'll have 10 billion humanoid robots by 2040. And he says that could even be lowballing. Even if only 1% of them are doing surgery, that's a 100 million surgical robots. The best surgical care in the world becomes available to villages throughout Africa and in rural America at a fraction of the cost. Healthcare stops being something you save up for or go bankrupt. It becomes available to everyone. Now, to end on a slightly lighter note, this clip had me in stitches. It's an absolute banger. Enjoy. compared to the sun, all other energy sources are like cavemen throwing some twigs into a fire. Um, so the the sun is over 99.8% of all mass in the solar system. Jupiter is around uh.1% of the mass. Uh, so even if you burnt Jupiter, >> the energy produced by the sun would still round up to 100%. >> Yeah. >> And then if you teleported three more Jupiters into our solar system and burnt them too, >> it would still round up. It still run the sun still runs up to 100% of energy. >> Any interest in fusion? >> I mean like fusion on a planet. Fusion, >> you know, coming a mile away. >> Never going to guess how the sun works. >> Giant coal plants. >> I mean, we have a giant fus free fusion reactor that shows up every day >> 93 million miles away. >> Yeah, it's farical for us to create little fusion reactors. Um, I mean that would be like, you know, having a tiny ice cube maker in the Antarctic and say, \"Hey, look, we made ice.\" I'm like, \"Congratulations. You're in the [ __ ] Antarctic.\" >> So, totally totally with you on this. >> It's like 3 km high glaciers right next to you. >> Ads are expensive and people don't trust them anymore, but they do trust YouTube. That's why three of our clients now make $100,000 a month for their business from growing a YouTube channel. If you run a business, book a call with me and I'll help you map this"
