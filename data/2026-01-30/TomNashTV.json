        "transcript": "Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Hold up a second. Hold up a second. Okay, we got to talk about Palunteer. Now, I'm going to shock you right now. The drop that we've seen from Palunteer over the past few days is the best thing that happened to the stock since probably 2024. And I'll explain why. Now, if you panic right now, which is totally understandable, but if you do, you're going to miss out on a huge money-making opportunity. And I'm going to explain why. By the end of this video, you'll see exactly how the top 10% of investors using moments like this to make generational wealth. And you also see probably why 90% of investors lose money consistently in a market that only goes up. Now, the S&P 500 does 10% per year. That's the normal statistic for the S&P 500. We all know this out of our sleep. And yet we also know that 90% of investors keep losing money in the stock market. Well, that is because of psychology. It's not because of lack of intelligence. It's not because of lack of capital. That is because of two emotions. Fear and greed. Okay? And usually these emotions, whether it's fear or greed, doesn't really matter. But most often, I'd say 95% of the time, these emotions get triggered at the worst possible time for retail investors. Now, Palanteer is down 16% of the past month. Palunteer is down 9% for the past 5 days. Oh my goodness. Palanteer has dropped from $171 to $150. Oh my goodness. Run for the hills. This is where most people focus their attention. This is where the conversation and sentiment is right now. But if you zoom out a little bit, the picture becomes a little clearer. Over the past 12 months, the stock is up almost 100%. Over the past 3 years, it's up 2400%. Now, dips happen, drops happen, crashes happen. It's not a bad thing. In fact, it's an opportunity to make money. And every time this happened in the past, whether it is Palunteer or the overall market or other stocks, we in the academy use this to make a lot of money. And it's not our first rodeo and it's not going to be the last. But before we go through that, I have to explain what's going on because a lot of you are concerned and rightfully so, you're asking a good question, Tom. What's going on with the share price? Why has it dropped so much in such a short time frame? Now, I understand the question, but first of all, a caveat, right? Whenever you talk about short-term price volatility, there's a lot of randomness. Sometimes it just happens because sometimes there's a lot of irrational things that happen. In the short term, the market can stay really, really crazy for a long time. But I'm going to try to make some sense of what you've seen over the past few days, maybe even few weeks. Okay. Number one, the stock is up 2400% over the past few years. So there is naturally a lot of profit taken, especially ahead of earnings, especially ahead of another uncertainty event. That's normal, right? Basically, the market has what I would call jitters right now. Trump isn't really helping the situation by engulfing the entire world in geopolitical concerns, macro concerns, and tariffs, and the whole thing feels a little bit shaky. And after many many years of bull markets after bull markets after bull markets, people have jitters. That's totally understandable, especially with a stock like Palanteer, especially heading into earnings week, which is by itself a very uncertain moment. Now, there is no business reason I can give you for why Palanteer is down 9%. We haven't had any canceled contracts, meaningful management departures. Nothing from a business perspective happened that would justify a drop like this. In fact, we actually had new deals announced over the past week that have been pretty monstrous, amazing deals. So, nothing happened on the business side. If that's what you're wondering, let me just calm you down. It's fine. Now, moments like this, they naturally spark fear. And I understand it. I totally get it. Right. This is exactly when you have knowledge and systems and discipline to protect you against this fear. The fear is normal and nothing you will ever learn in my videos or my academy is going to eliminate this fear because this fear is kind of programmed into your brain. It's hardwired. You can't avoid fear. That's a survival instinct, right? I can't help you with that. But I can help you to deal with this fear better. And the way you deal with fear better is through knowledge, is through conviction. Is through understanding what you're doing, understanding you have a system. And that basically eliminating the impact of the fear, not the fear itself. You know what they say, there's nothing to fear but the fear itself. Now, I have a full guide on how to do this. a full guide on a bulletproof DCA doubled down system that teaches you how to avoid the fear, how to minimize its impact. All of this is available in my DCA guide. Go get it right now. It's free in the description below. Click the first link. You can get it right now. No strings attached. Go get it right now. Now, if you look back at history, this is not our first rodeo. In fact, if you only look back all the way to February of 2025, you're going to find that Palenteer dropped from $125 all the way to $70. It dropped like 50% in a matter of a couple of weeks, 3 weeks, four weeks. And while this whole thing was going on and the sentiment was in the toilet and everybody was panicking, me and my students in my academy, we used that moment in February actively to accumulate as many shares as we could because when the stock you love and you are confident about and you have high conviction in, when that stock drops 50% all of a sudden in a couple of weeks, you buy the hell out of it. which is exactly what we've done. Which is exactly why that batch we bought in February 2025, not even a year ago, is up 100% now. Even after this latest drop, which is exactly what we've done in 2024 and 2023 and 2022, nothing has ever changed because the system is pretty much the same. It didn't change for the past 100 years. A few videos ago, I told you about the famous columnist John Crane where he had this story of a pig farmer who basically thought of the stock market as pig farming and whenever the pig got fat, he would sell them. Whenever got lean, he would buy them. Same thing he did with the stock market. Whenever the headlines were screaming that the world is over, he would buy like crazy. And whenever the headlines would say, \"Well, this is never going to end. The party is going to last forever.\" He would sell his stock. And that's how he never had a bad year in like 40 years. Right now, this is how you make money in the stock market. It's pretty simple. It's not complicated to learn the system. It's pretty straightforward. The problem is psychology. It's emotions. Okay. So, what do smart investors do in moments like the one we're experiencing right now with Palunteer? So, number one, in moments like this, smart investors focus on fundamentals. Okay. Do we have any new deals? Yes, we have two new deals this week. Okay. Did we have any meaningful problems? Did we have any alerts? Did anybody resign? Do we have scandals, lawsuits, etc., etc. Look at the fundamentals. Number two, increase their dollar cost average or basically if they're buying in lumpsum, buy a big chunk. It's a personal decision. I'm not telling you what to do, but whether you're DCAing or you're using basically lump sum buying, when moments like this happen, smart investors use them to increase whatever it is they're doing, whether it's DCA or lumpsum buying, they essentially revisit the strategy. If the stock is still good and the price is cheaper, you definitely want more of it. Right? At the end of the day, all I want you guys to do is ask yourself one question, right? Do you think irrespective of the price fluctuation, do you think that Palunteer is still a multi-year compounder? If the answer is yes, then this dip allows you an opportunity to buy more at a cheaper price and you should. And if the answer for you is no, then you shouldn't be buying Palanteer to begin with. It has nothing to do with the price. Now earnings approaching upon us very very shortly and these earnings they bring out a lot of uncertainty. They bring out a lot of volatility. Of course as we get closer and closer to earnings the noise is going to increase. The volatility is going to increase. Now for my experience buying and selling around earnings of any company is a bad idea. It's a it's a treacherous waters. I'm not going anywhere near that. That is why dead people outperform the living in every single study that's been done in any single brokerage that ever published similar studies. Right? Dead people don't do anything crazy. They just stay in the market. They beat people who, you know, pick the worst time to make the most horrible mistakes. And drops like this feel a lot worse than they really are. And that's the reality of it. A lot of the time it's kind of like optical illusions. And it takes a little bit of experience to kind of work your way through a few of these to figure out what's really going on. It's one of them mirrors that make you seem thinner or fatter or wider or smaller. It's an illusion, but once you've seen one or two, you basically know the drill. And the same thing here. If this is your first time, it's scary. I get it. Especially the speed, right? If a stock has this slow decline over six months, it's not scary. You know, it's pretty boring, right? But when you're coming down the elevator, it's scary. You know what they say, the market always climbs the stairs and comes down the elevator. It's not unusual for Palanteer to do that, but Palanteer is a more volatile stock than most. In fact, it probably is one of the most volatile big time stocks you can hold on to. But these sort of drops, a 9% drop for Palunteer is nothing. It's a Tuesday. Now, we've seen 50% drop in 3 weeks in February 2025. Now what investors do especially inexperienced investors when we have a big price drop the assumption in their head is okay there must be new information there must be new facts that are driving this price drop there must be otherwise why would the price drop and sorry to burst your bubble but it's not necessarily the case anytime the price drops we don't have new info we don't have important things that you need to know about in fact 99% of the time it's just short-term volatility being short-term volatility. Now, you have to understand that the people who drive daily price action are not long-term investors. The people who drive the everyday price movements of any stock are traders are people who are basically riding waves, riding trends, and whenever they think that the train might be coming, they're jumping off the tracks. And all of them do it at once. And that's why it feels so volatile, especially in the age of algorithmic trading where a lot of these bots imitate human behavior and they all do it like a school of fish. And it's mainly psychological. You know, it's amplified. It's overreactive. And yes, the market has become more overreactive because of algorithmic trading, but it's a lot less severe than it feels in real time. It feels like you're being inside this spin cycle inside of a washing machine, but it's just a, you know, it's a tempest in a teapot. Okay, but you have to understand who are the people who are selling right now. And there's a lot of people selling right now, otherwise the price wouldn't drop, right? But it's not the long-term holders. It's basically two groups of people. And these are the only groups who are selling right now. Number one are the traders, which I talked about earlier, and that's fine. That's what they're supposed to do. They make 10% here, they make 20% here, they jump to the next stock, etc., etc. And number two, this is the inexperienced retail investors or as I put it, investors with a weaker conviction about a stock. They are not confident about palenteers. So, they're selling just to make sure. Now, I just want to give you an example that Warren Buffett used and he said, \"Look, if you got a farm and your crazy neighbor keeps shouting prices at which he's willing to buy your farm every single day, is him shouting a price as, you know, 30% lower than what he shouted yesterday freaks you out?\" No. You basically say, \"No, I'm not interested in selling. Thank you.\" It doesn't impact what you feel about your farm. The same thing should be about a stock. There's nothing really different there, right? As a long-term investor, this how you have to think about it. Now, nothing changed for Palanteer's business. Let me just repeat it. Nothing changed for Palanteer business. There's the false assumption that it may have or should have because the price dropped, but price in the short term isn't really about value. It's about market sentiment. And whenever we have earnings coming up, stocks sometimes do that. They repric. It's normal. Nothing is unusual. The mood shifts a lot quicker than fundamentals change. Right now, earning weeks are a little bit more bipolar than usual. The market in itself is a little bit bipolar by definition, but earning weeks, they become a lot crazier, a lot more volatile. And what good investors really do in these times is they get comfortable with uncertainty. Right? If this is your first time on a tuna fishing boat and it's rocking like crazy in the middle of the night, you want to vomit. It's it's not it's it's not comfortable. It's very discomforting. It is the worst feeling in the world, right? But if you're a tuna fisherman, this is your 15th ride or 2500 rides into it, you're basically just saying, \"Hey, I'm really comfortable. I don't know what the problem is.\" It's just normal, part of the course. If you understand that mindset where you just have to get used to feeling uncomfortable and used to feeling uncertain, you're going to make a lot of money in the stock market, whether it's Palanteer or Tesla or Nvidia or any other stock. Right now, earnings are important. I'm not saying that we should ignore earnings, but they're not the focus a week ahead of it, right? Sure, we're going to look at growth. We're going to look at demand. We're going to look at margins. We're going to look at what the guidance is. We're going to look at consistency pro, you know, compared to last year. All of this will be examined when the earnings come out. But what's the point to freak out about earnings, about fears of something that may or may not happen ahead of time. Now what inexperienced investors do in time like this they shrink their time horizon. When I talk to these folks when the stock is up 300% over the past six months their horizon is 20 years. If I talk to them after 5 day drop their horizon is probably like 3 days. It really does that. And the best way to kill a good long-term strategy is by being reactive by trading in and out trying to buy trying to guessing tops and bottoms. It's the worst thing you can do. Now if you look at piloter on stock MVP the pilanteer scores are some of the best we have on the platform. Profitability is 85 out of 100. Growth is 91 out of 100. Solveny 75 out of 100. Overall it scores 81 out of 100. Net income is up 43% and a half over the past 12 months. And the current margin net margin is 16.3% which is extremely high for any company net margin. Right now, you may argue about P ratio being too high. Oh my god, Lord, look at the P ratio. Palunteer is horrible. Blah blah blah blah blah blah. Look, I'm just going to defer to my good friend Peter Lynch who said it's never a bad time to buy a great company. And Palanteer has showed it again and again over the past few years. It has never had a cheap PE, but if you held it for the past three years, you made 2,400% because it's a great company. There is no bad time to buy a great company. Now, great investors understand that sometimes the best absolute strategy is simply to do nothing. And this might be one of those times in experienced investors, they grasp for this illusion of control. It feels uncertain. It feels like they're losing control. They need to do something so they can feel they're in control of the situation, but it's an illusion. It's not real. At some point, you have to learn that process is more important than the short-term outcomes. Even if you've done the right thing, but short-term you don't look good, that's fine because it's all about the process. Trust the process. It boring? Yes. Scary? Yes. Discoming? Yes. Extremely. But it always works out in the long term. It's always about the reason to sell. The media is going to hype it up when it's flying up and it's going to scare the living beige out of you when it's coming down. There's always going to be a reason to sell the stock. There's always going to be people in the comments on social media tell you this time it's different. No, it's not. It's not different. It's the same we've seen over the past 100 years. Nothing has changed. Okay. Now, if you look right now in my academy chat, you're going to see calm, clear, intentional people having a conversation about Palunteer, talking fundamentals, having discussions. Nobody's panicking because it's not about being smarter. It's not about intelligence. us in the academy, all 28,000 members of us. We're not smarter than the average retail investor. But we do have a system and a discipline. And we combine system with discipline, you get long-term capital building, which is exactly what we do in the academy. Slow. None of this happens fast. If you're going to go to the gym and you want to go from 35% body fat to 10% body fat and you're going to say, \"Well, I want to do this in a month.\" It's not going to happen. It's not going to happen. You probably need, you know, six to 12 months at minimum to do this. If you want to get rich in the stock market, if you want to create generational wealth, you have to accept the fact it's a slow process. It's very easy to get rich slow. It is extremely hard, next to impossible to get rich quick. And if all you want to do is feel comfortable, eat Doritos, watch Netflix, number one, you're never going to be 10% body fat. Number two, you're never going to make money in the stock market because you can't make money in the stock market by feeling comfortable. Discomfort and uncertainty is how money is made long term, which is exactly what I teach in my academy. patreon.com/tomash, 28,000 members. My students know the difference between noise and hoopla and sentiment and value. My students don't get razzledazzled or discomforted or freaked out of positions. We do this the right way. That's why the system works. Invite you to join us. Try it out. See for yourself. Would love to have you there. Thank you so much. I'll see you in the next one. Peace."
