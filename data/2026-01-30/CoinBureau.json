        "transcript": "We thought that the Clarity Act failed because of a disagreement over definitions. We thought it died because the Senate couldn't agree on jurisdiction. But the real reason the most important crypto bill of 2026 collapsed in a heap of procedural ash isn't about regulation or consumer protection. It is about a $6.6 trillion nightmare scenario that has the biggest banks in America terrified of extinction. For weeks, we have been told that the banking lobby killed the bill to quote protect the financial system. But when you look at the maths, and I mean the real maths that they discuss in closed doors earnings calls, not the sound bites that they give to CNBC, you realize that they aren't trying to save the economy. They are trying to save themselves. Because there is a massive gaping hole in the traditional banking business model. A hole that stable coins were about to expose. And the banks realized that if they didn't kill this bill, or at least poison it with a very specific clause, they stood to lose 35% of their deposit base overnight. This is the story of the $6.6 trillion secret. It is the story of why your savings account pays you pennies while your bank makes billions. And it is the story of how a free market, America, is banning yield while authoritarian China is doing the exact opposite. My name is Louis and this is the Coin Bureau. Now, before I begin, you need to know that I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. This is educational content intended to show you exactly how the financial sausage is made and why the chefs are trying to ban the competition. If that sounds good, then go ahead and smash that like button like it's a bank lobbyist trying to steal your yield. >> Let's get into it. January 2026, the Digital Asset Market Clarity Act, or simply the Clarity Act, was supposed to be the endgame. After the Genius Act passed last year, giving us a basic framework for stable coin issuance, the Clarity Act was designed to settle the market structure question once and for all. Senate Banking Committee Chairman Tim Scott had been working on this for months and had it ready for a markup with bipartisan support. But then on the 12th of January, just days before the scheduled markup, a new draft appeared and buried deep in the text was a provision that looked innocent enough to a lay man, but was essentially a declaration of war to the crypto industry. The provision explicitly banned digital asset providers from paying interest or yield, quote, simply for holding stable coins. Now, why would the United States government care if you earn 4% on your USDC instead of 0% on your digital dollars? The answer lies in what you might call the yield gap. Let's look at the numbers because the math here is something else. As of January 2026, the national average interest rate for a standard savings account in the US is roughly 0.39%. For a checking account, it is essentially zero, around 0.07%. 07%. That means if you put $10,000 into a checking account at Chase or Wells Fargo, they will pay you about $7 a year for the privilege of holding your money. But what does the bank do with that money? Well, they don't just put it in a vault. They turn around and buy short-term US Treasury bills with it. And right now, even with the rates stabilizing, 3-month Treasury bills are paying around 3.6%. So, the bank takes your money, they pay you 0.07%, they invest it in risk-free government debt paying 3.6% and they pocket the difference. That spread, that roughly 3.5% gap, is the lifeblood of the commercial banking industry. It is free money. They are essentially arbitrageers using your capital to generate risk-free returns for themselves while paying you crumbs. But then came stable coins. Issuers like Circle and platforms like Coinbase realize something obvious. If stable coins are backed by those same US treasuries, why not just pass the yield on to the user? Why not cut out the middleman? If the reserves are earning 4%, why shouldn't the holder of the stable coin earn 4%. Or at least 3.5%. This is why until the regulatory crackdown began, you could easily find yields on stable coins that were 50 to 70 times higher than a bank checking account. For a customer, the choice is obvious. Do you want to earn $7 a year at the bank or do you want to earn $400 a year on chain? It's the same dollar. It's the same underlying asset backing it. The only difference is that in one scenario, the bank keeps the profit. In the other, you do. And the banks are terrified that you are going to figure this out. In fact, they aren't just terrified. They have run the numbers. And the results don't make for happy reading. This brings us to the nightmare scenario. During a Q4 earnings call on the 15th of January, Bank of America CEO Brian Monahan dropped a bombshell that most of the mainstream media completely missed. He referenced Treasury Department studies suggesting that if stable coins were allowed to freely offer yield, up to $6 trillion in deposits could flee the banking system. Some industry estimates put that number even higher at 6.6 trillion. To put that into perspective, total US commercial bank deposits sit around 18.6 trillion. So we are talking about roughly 30 to 35% of all the money held in US banks just well walking out the door. Imagine if Walmart suddenly lost 35% of its customers to a competitor that sold the exact same products for cheaper prices. Walmart would collapse. And the banks know this. But their argument, the one they used to lobby the Senate, wasn't just we will lose money. No, no. They played the economic collapse card. They argued that this deposit flight would destroy the lending market. According to data from the Federal Reserve and the Kansas City Fed, there is a multiplier effect to bank deposits. For every 100 billion in deposits that leaves the banking system, banks are forced to contract their lending by anywhere from 60 billion to 126 billion. So if $6 trillion leaves, well, we aren't just talking about empty bank vaults. We're talking about a contraction in credit that could reach into the trillions of dollars. This is the narrative that they sold to Washington. They said, \"If you let Coinbase and Circle pay interest, we won't be able to write mortgage loans. We won't be able to fund small businesses. We won't be able to support farmers. It's a classic protectionist racket. Protect our monopoly or we crash the economy. And honestly, if you are a politician looking at a midterm election year, that is a terrifying threat. But if you are a crypto investor, you have a different problem. You need to know how to navigate a market where the rules are being rewritten in real time to protect the incumbents. And that is exactly why you need to check out the Coin Bureau deals page. Look, whether the banks win or lose this fight, volatility is guaranteed. And if you are trading in this environment, you need an exchange that isn't going to fleece you on fees, just like how the banks fleece you on interest. We have spent years vetting the best platforms on the industry to find the ones that actually treat retail investors, right? We're talking about exclusive signup bonuses of up to $100,000. We're talking about trading fee discounts of up to 50%. And deposit cash backs of up to 75%. These are offers that you cannot find by just going to the homepage. You have to use our link. So, stop paying full price fees to trade your own money. Hit the link in the description or scan the QR code on the screen right now. It helps support the channel and it helps you keep more of that yield for yourself. Now, let's get back to the legislative kill switch. So, the banks had their narrative. Stable coins will drain 6.6 trillion and crash the economy. And they had their lobbyists, the American Bankers Association, America's credit unions, the whole gang, flooding Capitol Hill with letters. The result was that January 12th draft of the Clarity Act. The provision they inserted was clever. It didn't try to ban stable coins. That would have been too obvious. Instead, it tried to ban passive yield. It said that a crypto service provider cannot pay you interest solely for holding a stable coin. They tried to frame this as a safety measure. They argued that if a crypto platform pays yield, it is acting like a bank and therefore it should be regulated like a bank. But Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong saw right through it. On Wednesday, January 14th, just one day before the markup was supposed to happen, Armstrong publicly withdrew Coinbase's support for the bill. He called the provision exactly what it was, a quote kill switch for stable coin rewards. He said, quote, \"It just felt deeply unfair to me that one industry would come in and get to do regulatory capture to ban their competition.\" And he was right. Armstrong realized that if this bill passed, it would cement the bank's advantage forever. It would make it illegal for crypto to compete on price. It would be like Ford lobbying the government to ban Tesla from selling EVs cheaper than petrol vehicles. Coinbase's withdrawal was the final nail in the coffin. Without the support of the biggest crypto company in America, the Republicans on the Senate Banking Committee got cold feet. And on January 15th, Chairman Tim Scott postponed the markup. The bill collapsed. And for a moment, it looks like a victory for crypto. We stopped a bad bill. But the irony of the situation, and I mean the deep painful irony, is what is happening on the other side of the world. While the United States is tearing itself apart, trying to ban digital currency yields to protect legacy banks, China is doing the exact opposite. As of 1st of January 2026, the People's Bank of China officially shifted the digital one, the ECNY, from being just digital cash to being digital deposit currency. And guess what? It pays interest. Yes, you heard that right. The authoritarian Chinese government is paying its citizens 0.05% interest to hold their central bank digital currency. Now 0.05% might not sound like that much, but it is the principle that matters. China has recognized that for a digital currency to compete, it needs to offer utility. It needs to offer yield. They are incentivizing adoption by making the digital yuan a superior product to physical cash. Meanwhile, the free market United States is using the power of the federal government to ensure that digital dollars remain inferior to bank deposits. Coinbase's chief policy author Far Sherzad pointed this out explicitly. He warned that we are handing a massive competitive advantage to foreign CBDC's and offshore stable coins. Think about the global implications. If you are a merchant in Brazil or Nigeria or Indonesia and you have a choice between holding a US dollar stable coin that is legally banned from paying you interest or a digital yuan or a euro stable coin that pays you a yield automatically, which one are you going to choose? Capital flows to where it is treated best. And right now, US banking lobbyists are ensuring that capital is treated worse in America than almost anywhere else. Anthony Scaramucci put it best. He said, quote, \"The banks do not want the competition, so they're blocking the yield. In the meantime, the Chinese are issuing yield. So, what do you think the emerging countries will choose?\" So, the Clarity Act is stalled. The banks have shown their hand, and we are now in a dangerous limbo. There are really only three ways this plays out. Scenario one, the legislative stalemate continues. In this world, the innovation exemption promised by the SEC might protect some players, but the big banks stay on the sidelines. The yield gap remains, but it moves entirely offshore. We will see the rise of rapper products. You won't earn yield on your USDC directly. Instead, you will wrap it in a DeFi liquidity token that just happens to pay 4% APY. Technically, complying with the law while giving the middle finger to the banks. Innovation always finds a workound. Scenario two is a watered down compromise. There is a talk of a new draft that allows activity based rewards. Basically, you can't earn yield for sitting on your money, but you can earn yield for staking it or transacting with it. This is the credit card points model. Banks are okay with this because it requires you to spend money to make money. It doesn't threaten their deposit base in the same way. But scenario three is the one that banks are truly afraid of. Scenario three is that the technology simply wins. You see, the banks are fighting a war against efficiency. They're trying to maintain a 3.5% spread in a world where technology has reduced the cost of that spread to near zero. It is like the taxi industry fighting Uber. They can ban it. They can regulate it. They can make it difficult, but they cannot uninvent the efficiency. If the US bans stable coin yield, the market will simply move to decentralized protocols that no CEO can switch off. We're already seeing this with real world assets. Tokenized treasuries are exploding in popularity. Black Rockck isn't launching tokenized funds on Ethereum because they like the logo. They're doing it because it is efficient. The $6.6 trillion exodus that Brian Moahan is so afraid of, well, it's going to happen. Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, but you cannot keep trillions of dollars wrapped in 0% accounts forever when this technology exists to set it free. The banks have won this round. They killed the bill, but in doing so, they have revealed exactly how terrified they are. They see the future, and guess what? It doesn't include them earning 3.5% on your money for doing absolutely nothing. How very, very sad. But I want to know what you think. Is Brian Armstrong right to kill the bill and hold out for better terms? Or should the crypto industry have taken the deal just to get some regulatory clarity? And are you worried about the 6.6 trillion deposit flight crashing the economy? Or is that just fear-mongering from the banks? Let me know what you think in the comments below. And if you want to understand more about how China is positioning the digital yuan to take over the dollar, well, you can check out that video right over here. And if you are wondering which stable coins are actually safe to hold in this regulatory minefield, well, you can check out that video right over here. Thank you all so much for watching and I will see you again very soon. This is Louis signing off."
