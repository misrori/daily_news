    "transcript": "A  new  chapter  is  being  written  in  one  of   crypto's  biggest  ever  stories.  Remember   Terraform  Labs  and  the  $40  billion   collapse  of  their  Luna  token  and  the  US   stablecoin?  Well,  Terraform's  windown   team  just  filed  a  lawsuit  in  a  Manhattan   federal  court.  And  they're  arguing  that   one  of  the  biggest  trading  firms  on  Wall   Street  didn't  just  trade  through  the   terror  collapse,  it  allegedly   accelerated  it  by  acting  on  inside   information.  The  complaint  targets  Jane   Street  Group  co-founder  Robert  Granier   and  two  employees,  Bryce  Pratt  and   Michael  Hang.  In  the  simplest  terms,  the   complaint  is  asking  for  damages  tied  to   the  2022  implosion  of  US  and  Luna.  Jane   Street's  response,  they  deny  all   wrongdoing,  call  the  case  a  desperate   money  grab,  and  say  they'll  defend   themselves  aggressively.  Now,  if  you're   wondering  why  a  bankruptcy  plan   administrator  is  the  one  taking  this   swing,  it's  because  Terraform,  as  we   knew  it,  isn't  a  going  concern  anymore.   It  filed  for  chapter  11  bankruptcy  back   in  January  2024  and  its  court  approved   windown  plan  set  up  a  structure  to   liquidate  assets  and  pursue  litigation   that  could  bring  money  back  to   creditors.  But  for  simplicity  sake,   we'll  just  refer  to  Terraform's  windown   team  as  Terraform  going  forward.  Anyway,   that  plan  was  approved  after  Terraform   agreed  to  a  $4.5  billion  SEC  resolution   that  on  its  own  was  never  going  to   miraculously  make  victims  whole.  The   legal  theory  Terraform  is  pursuing  in   this  lawsuit  made  headlines  for  a   reason.  Jane  Street  allegedly  got   material  non-public  information  from   people  inside  Terraform,  then  used  it  to   frontr  run  the  moment  when  the  US  stable   coins  peg  was  most  vulnerable.  The  suit   claims  this  let  Jane  Street  unwind   hundreds  of  millions  of  dollars  in   exposure  at  just  the  right  time,  hours   before  the  ecosystem  broke  apart.  The   filing  itself  is  heavily  redacted.  So,   the  estate  is  clearly  angling  for   discovery,  and  that  means  internal   messages  and  all  manner  of  paper  trails   behind  whichever  wallets  were  moving   large  sums.  The  complaint's  most   attention-grabbing  pieces,  however,  are   about  information  flow.  Terraform's   estate  alleges  Jane  Street  used  a  back   channel  tied  to  Bryce  Pratt,  described   as  a  former  Terraform  intern  who  later   worked  at  Jane  Street.  Allegedly,  a   private  group  chat  called  Bryce's  Secret   sat  at  the  center  of  this  controversy.   Given  this  kind  of  detail,  the  lawsuit   further  solidifies  the  terror  collapse   as  the  event  that  triggered  the  crypto   winter  of  2022.  Only  now  we  see  that  it   may  not  have  been  totally  random.  It  set   off  a  wider  chain  reaction  across  crypto   and  is  still  viewed  as  the  mess  that   paved  the  way  for  later  blowups  like   FTX.  So,  if  the  Terraform  estate  can   credibly  argue  that  an  outside  market   maker  worsened  the  spiral  with   non-public  info,  that  changes  how  the   post-mortem  is  going  to  be  told  in  court   filings  and  creditor  meetings  for  years.   At  the  same  time,  Terraform's  own   conduct  is  already  on  the  record.  In   April  2024,  a  Manhattan  jury  found   Terraform  and  its  co-founder  Doan  liable   in  the  SEC's  civil  fraud  case,  agreeing   with  the  regulator  that  investors  were   misled  ahead  of  the  2022  collapse.  Now,   this  is  key  because  Jane  Street's   defense  basically  writes  itself,  \"The   losses  came  from  Terraform's  deception   and  product  design,  not  from  a  trading   firm  reacting  to  market  stress.\"  So,   it's  important  to  note  that  the   Terraform  estate  isn't  operating  in  a   vacuum  here.  It's  making  these  claims   knowing  that  a  court  has  already  agreed   terraform  broke  the  law  and  the  cleanup   process  is  explicitly  about  distributing   whatever  value  can  be  recovered.  But  we   also  have  the  criminal  side.  In  December   2025,  Docoin  was  sentenced  to  15  years   in  prison  in  the  US  for  what  the  judge   described  as  a  massive  fraud  tied  to  the   terror  collapse.  Depending  on  your   perspective,  that  could  make  Terraform's   lawsuit  seem  less  frivolous  and  more   like  an  effort  to  chase  anyone  the   estate  believes  profited  during  the   meltdown  window.  However,  it  also  fits  a   pattern.  In  December  2025,  the  Terraform   estate  sued  Jump  Trading  for  $4  billion,   alleging  it  played  an  outsized  role  in   terror's  downfall  and  profited  from  it.   And  now  Jane  Street  is  the  next  major   trading  name  in  the  crosshairs.  If   you're  Jane  Street,  the  incentive  here   is  clearly  to  kill  this  before  Discovery   turns  a  redacted  complaint  into   thousands  of  pages  of  sensitive  emails   and  chats.  And  now,  in  order  to  get  a   good  understanding  of  Terraform's   allegations,  it's  worth  taking  a  step   back  and  reminding  ourselves  how   Terraform's  US  stable  coin  was  built.   TerraUSD,  or  simply  US,  was  an   algorithmic  stable  coin,  meaning  it   wasn't  primarily  propped  up  by  cash  or   treasuries  sitting  in  custody.  Instead,   US  was  supposed  to  be  pegged  via  a  swap   mechanism  with  its  sister  token,  Luna.   One  US  could  be  swapped  for  $1  worth  of   Luna  and  the  US  was  burned  when  it  was   swapped.  If  US  traded  below  $1,  traders   were  meant  to  buy  discounted  US,  swap  it   for  $1  of  Luna  and  profit,  all  while   shrinking  US  supply  and  pushing  the   price  back  towards  the  peg.  If  US  traded   above  $1,  the  incentive  went  in  the   other  direction.  You  burn  $1  worth  of   Luna  to  mint  one  US,  then  sell  that  US   at  a  premium.  Now,  on  paper,  that   two-way  arbitrage  was  supposed  to  keep   US  close  to  $1.  The  problem  was  that  the   loop  depended  on  Luna  holding  up  under   stress.  When  people  exited  US  through   the  swap,  Luna's  supply  expanded.  And  if   the  market  couldn't  absorb  that  new  Luna   without  crashing  the  price,  the  backs   stop  weakened  quickly  because  the  $1   redemption  was  paid  in  an  asset  that  was   falling  as  more  of  it  got  printed.  That   reflexivity  was  why  the  design  was  so   fragile.  In  good  times,  US  demand  burned   Luna,  and  that  could  support  Luna's   price.  In  bad  times,  the  mechanism  ran   in  reverse  and  pushed  more  Luna  into  a   falling  market.  Once  traders  started   expecting  a  wave  of  redemptions,  as  they   did  in  2022,  the  pressure  quickly  built   up.  Burn  US,  mint  Luna,  sell  Luna,   repeat.  And  as  you  may  recall,  US  demand   also  had  a  very  specific  driver.  A  lot   of  it  flowed  through  Anker,  a  Terra  app   that  marketed  returns  of  nearly  20%  a   year  for  depositing  US.  This  yield  was  a   major  factor  in  US's  growth,  basically   turning  US  into  a  savings  product  for  a   huge  chunk  of  the  crypto  ecosystem.  But   once  that  confidence  cracked,  the  peg   wasn't  defended  as  portrayed  in  the   white  paper.  it  was  defended  or  rather   not  defended  on  exchanges  and  in  onchain   liquidity  pools  where  stability  depends   on  depth  and  balance.  In  other  words,   terror  was  a  major  algorithmic  stable   coin  experiment  that  unraveled  when   selling  pressure  and  redemptions  hit  at   scale.  And  when  stress  hits  hard  enough,   people  and  teams  start  taking  drastic   action  and  emergency  measures.  Terror   developers  halted  the  network's   blockchain  during  the  fallout  to  try  to   prevent  attacks  as  US  and  Luna   collapsed.  But  because  Terror  was  also   wired  into  DeFi,  the  impact  didn't  stop   at  Terror  Native  apps.  The  fallout  was   in  fact  so  big  that  the  Federal  Reserve   itself  later  studied  how  the  failure   transmitted  stress  through   interconnected  DeFi  infrastructure  with   bridges  helping  spread  spillovers.  And   that  brings  us  back  to  the  recent   lawsuit  because  the  Terraform  estate  has   now  fixed  its  eye  on  the  exact  timing  of   big  liquidity  decisions  and  huge  flows   during  the  collapse.  It's  looking  at   very  specific  actions  where  a  few   minutes  appear  to  have  changed  the  whole   outcome.  If  they  can  successfully  argue   their  case,  history  may  be  rewritten.

Okay,  so  with  the   Luna  and  US  mechanism  in  mind,  let's  dig   into  the  specifics  of  Terraform's   allegations  against  Jane  Street,  because   this  is  where  things  get  really   interesting.  If  Terraform  wants  to   change  how  the  story  of  Terror's   collapse  is  remembered,  then  that   process  begins  with  timestamped  messages   and  who  had  access  before  the  rest  of   the  market  did.  One  of  the  lawsuits  main   claims  is  that  Jane  Street  Traders  built   a  private  communications  channel  with   people  inside  Terraform  and  that  it   wasn't  just  informal  networking.  As   noted  earlier,  there  was  allegedly  a   chat  named  Bryce's  Secret  used  to   channel  Terraform  related  information   back  to  Jane  Street.  In  the  complaint,   the  Terraform  Windown  Trust  presents   employee  Bryce  Pratt  as  the  connector.   It  says  Pratt  previously  interned  at   Terraform,  built  relationships  with   staff,  then  went  on  to  join  Jane  Street,   and  later  used  those  relationships  to   open  lines  of  communication  back  into   Terraform.  It  also  says  Pratt  started  an   email  chain  introducing  Terraform's  head   of  business  development  to  leaders  of   Jane  Street's  DeFi  efforts.  And  you   guessed  it,  those  discussions  about   trading  and  potential  investment   allegedly  turned  into  a  back  channel  for   material  non-public  information.  The   complaint  even  alleges  Terraform's  then   head  of  research  was  actively  asking   Pratt  what  Jane  Street  was  discussing   while  also  interviewing  for  a  job  at   Jane  Street  around  the  same  period.  Even   while  US  was  already  sliding,  the  filing   says  Pratt  was  still  operating  as  a   conduit.  And  that  brings  us  to  the  9th   of  May  2022  when  Pratt  allegedly  started   a  group  message  with  Doan  and  Jane   Street  colleagues  about  bidding  on  BTC   or  Luna.  Bear  in  mind  this  is  while  US   had  already  deped  and  was  trading  below   80  cents.  Terror  was  on  the  ropes  in   other  words.  Apparently,  Quan  replied  by   pointing  to  Jump  co-founder  Bill  Dama   and  a  possible  fund  raise.  So,  that's   the  part  about  who  talked  to  whom,  but   the  significance  of  all  this  relates  to   a  very  specific  window  on  the  DeFi  app   Curve  Finance  for  US.  Curve's  big  stable   coin  pools  were  the  place  to  move  real   size.  The  estates  theory  focuses  on  the   7th  of  May  2022,  a  couple  of  days  prior   to  the  group  message  just  mentioned.  On   the  7th  of  May,  Terraform  pulled  150   million  US  from  Curve's  three  pool.  Then   minutes  later,  according  to  the  suit,  a   wallet  that's  been  linked  to  Jane  Street   sells  85  million  US  in  a  single   transaction.  So,  Terraform  argues  that   Jane  Street  acted  on  inside  information   which  accelerated  the  DPEG  and  downfall   of  US  because  Quan  only  announced   publicly  that  Terraform  had  withdrawn   that  150  million  US  on  the  8th  of  May  in   order  to  prepare  for  a  new  liquidity   pool  that  would  include  other  stable   coins.  Terraform's  public  explanation   was  that  it  was  repositioning  liquidity   ahead  of  a  new  curve  pool.  So  why  would   a  few  minutes  matter?  Well,  because  in   an  automated  market  maker  like  curve,   price  is  just  a  function  of  pool   balances.  If  you  recall  the  Luna  US   mechanism,  it's  fragile  when  selling   pressure  and  redemptions  hit  at  scale.   So  pull  enough  liquidity  and  the  curve   liquidity  pool  gets  easier  to  imbalance,   which  means  selling  pressure  hits  harder   and  faster  and  you  can  enter  a  death   spiral.  If  you're  a  sophisticated  desk   and  you  know  in  advance  that  a  major   pool  is  about  to  get  meaningfully   thinner,  you  can  trade  that  knowledge  in   a  number  of  ways.  You  can  reduce  US   exposure  earlier  when  the  peg  is  still   close  enough  to  $1  that  slippage  is   manageable.  You  can  prehedge  correlated   exposure  and  you  can  even  be  outright   short  a  bunch  of  different  cryptos  if   you're  making  markets.  You  can  also   change  how  aggressively  you  quote  and   how  much  inventory  you'll  absorb  because   you  expect  major  volatility  coming  your   way  in  a  fast  liquidation  cascade.  That   head  start  makes  the  difference  between   exiting  on  your  own  terms  and  being   forced  to  take  the  market  you're  given.   And  according  to  the  lawsuit,  Jane   Street  capitalized  on  all  the   information  it  obtained  through  that   open  line  of  communication,  including   the  group  message  on  the  9th  of  May  when   US  was  already  deped  and  terror  was   really  under  pressure.  But  this  is  also   where  the  case  gets  difficult.   Blockchains  show  you  what  happened,  but   not  who  did  it.  Wallet  attribution  can   be  convincing,  but  in  court,  it  usually   needs  something  off-chain  to  lock  it  in.   Terraform  will  likely  need  some  form  of   exchange  records,  counterparties,   internal  communications,  or  a  clean   chain  of  custody  on  who  controlled  which   addresses.  That  is  the  hinge  of  the   lawsuit's  theory.  The  estate  is  saying   the  collapse  wasn't  just  a  fragile   system  snapping  under  stress.  Instead,   it's  saying  that  certain  players  could   see  vulnerabilities  thanks  to  privileged   information  and  traded  that  reality  to   book  massive  profits.  Now,  Jane  Street's   position,  as  you  might  imagine,  is  that   there  was  no  pipeline,  no  insider   advantage,  and  no  causal  link  strong   enough  to  pin  this  disaster  on  their   trading.  So  from  here,  everything   depends  on  whether  discovery  turns  these   allegations  into  evidence  that's   overwhelmingly  convincing.  And  that's   the  fork  in  the  road  for  this  case.  Does   it  get  to  discovery  or  does  it  get  cut   down  before  anyone  has  to  hand  over   internal  records?  First,  the  estate  has   to  get  the  filing  into  proper  shape.  The   SDNY  docket  shows  the  court  issued  a   deficiency  notice  telling  Terraform  to   refile  the  complaint  with  the  correctly   signed  PDF  and  to  comply  with  the   court's  redaction  rules.  That  came  with   a  warning  to  Todd  Snder,  Terraform's   lead  administrator,  that  the  case  can  be   closed  if  they  don't  fix  it.  But  that   likely  gets  done  hastily,  perhaps  by  the   time  this  video  comes  out.  So,  if  they   refile  and  serve  Jane  Street,  the  next   move  will  likely  be  an  early  attempt  to   kill  it,  a  motion  to  dismiss.  Jane   Street  will  likely  argue  the  complaint   is  a  story  built  on  timing  and   suggestive  chat  screenshots,  but  that  it   doesn't  plead  a  legally  solid  chain  from   confidential  info  to  wrongful  trading.   If  the  judge  buys  that,  Snyder  never   gets  discovery  and  the  case  ends   quickly.  But  if  the  judge  doesn't,   Discovery  is  where  things  get  heated  and   it's  time  to  grab  your  popcorn.  The   Terraform  estate  will  want  what  the   blockchain  can't  give  us.  Who  controlled   the  wallets?  What  was  traded  on  which   venues?  What  was  said  internally  around   the  7th  of  May  curve  moves  and  whether   any  of  those  messages  were  actually   treated  as  confidential.  Jane  Street,   meanwhile,  will  try  to  narrow  everything   and  keep  proprietary  trading  details   sealed.  For  the  insider  trading   allegations,  the  legal  test  would  be   pretty  traditional.  Was  the  information   non-public  and  material  at  the  time?  Was   it  shared  under  a  duty  of   confidentiality  or  misappropriated?  Did   trading  on  it  involve  deception  or   another  actionable  wrong  under  the   claims  being  asserted?  The  crypto  market   has  seen  regulators  and  prosecutors  try   to  answer  those  questions  in  other   cases,  too.  In  2023,  former  Coinbase   product  manager  Ishan  Wahi  was  sentenced   to  2  years  in  prison  for  tipping  others   about  upcoming  token  listings.  That's  a   case  prosecutors  described  as  the  first   crypto  insider  trading  case,  even  though   it  was  charged  as  wire  fraud  conspiracy.   Now,  of  course,  we're  currently  under  a   different  administration  than  we  were   back  in  2023.  So,  it's  not  exactly  a   perfect  comparison  if  we're  trying  to   gauge  repercussions  for  insider  trading.   Nevertheless,  if  the  case  proceeds  and   the  evidence  against  Jane  Street  is   compelling,  we  may  see  some  harsh   penalties  dished  out.  Bear  in  mind  that   Terraform's  case  is  a  civil  one  and  not   a  criminal  case.  So,  prison  isn't  on  the   table  unless  a  separate  criminal  case  is   brought  forth.  The  law  can  also  push   back  when  insider  trading  is  stretched   into  novel  digital  asset  settings.  Last   year,  a  US  appeals  court  overturned  the   conviction  of  a  former  OpenC  product   manager  in  what  was  acknowledged  as  the   first  NFT  insider  trading  case.  The   decision  came  down  to  flawed  jury   instructions.  So,  the  message  is  that   judges  want  comprehensive  theories,  not   just  raw  facts.  Other  than  these   scenarios,  what  are  the  possible   outcomes?  Well,  the  parties  could  settle   because  fighting  over  trading  records   and  sensitive  communications  is   expensive  and  unpredictable  for   everyone.  It's  also  worth  noting  that   Jane  Street  is  already  fighting  a   separate  high-profile  regulatory  case  in   India  after  being  barred  from  local   derivatives  trading  for  market   manipulation.  An  appeal  remains  active,   so  it  may  have  an  extra  incentive  to   invoid  more  reputational  heat  elsewhere.   And  although  these  are  separate  cases   and  should  be  treated  as  such  in  courts   of  law,  practically  it's  not  a  great   look  for  Jane  Street  to  be  battling   multiple  cases  of  trading  misconduct  at   the  same  time.  But  beyond  courtrooms,   there's  the  wider  industry  impact.  You   don't  need  us  to  tell  you  that  crypto  is   already  down  in  the  dumps.  Retail  in   particular  is  growing  more  disillusioned   by  the  day  as  the  bare  market  grinds  on.   If  it  shown  that  one  of  the  biggest   trading  firms  operating  in  the  space  was   actively  butchering  projects  for  extra   profit,  well,  it  wouldn't  be  great  for  a   morale  that  is  already  very  low.   However,  this  wouldn't  exactly  be  the   only  instance  of  cryptonatives  suffering   this  kind  of  betrayal  and  the  industry   has  bounced  back  bigger  every  time.  So,   it's  quite  possible  that  this  story,   which  echoes  the  2022  bare  market,  is   just  another  piece  of  ugly  news  that   marks  the  dark  days  of  the  current  bare   market.  But  that's  the  thing  about  the   dark  times.  Brighter  days  always  lie   ahead.  All right,  folks.  That's  about   all  we  have  on  this  developing  story  for   now.  But  what  do  you  reckon?  Will  Jane   Street  be  found  liable  and  forced  to  pay   up?  Or  is  this  just  a  sly  attempt  from   Terraform  to  claw  back  some  money?  Let   us  know  your  thoughts  down  in  the   comments.  And  speaking  of  stable  coins,   if  you  want  to  learn  why  stables  that   actually  hold  their  peg  are  at  the   center  of  a  battle  between  banks  and   crypto,  then  you  should  check  out  this   video  right  over  here.  But  that's  all   from  me  for  today.  So,  as  always,  thank   you  for  watching  and  I'll  see  you  in  the   next  one.  This  is  Guy  signing",

    "summary_en": "Terraform Labs has initiated a lawsuit against Jane Street, alleging that the firm leveraged insider information during the 2022 collapse of the Luna token, exacerbating the crisis in the crypto market. The complaint targets Jane Street co-founder Robert Granier and two employees, Bryce Pratt and Michael Hang, who are said to have established secret communications with Terraform insiders. According to Terraform, Jane Street managed to unwind hundreds of millions of dollars in exposure while the market was in a critical state. Jane Street denies the allegations and claims the lawsuit stems from a desperate attempt to regain money. They emphasize that the claims lack substance since Terraform's own responsibilities have already been confirmed in a previous SEC case. The evidence supporting the allegations and the timing of transactions will play a crucial role in future court proceedings.",
