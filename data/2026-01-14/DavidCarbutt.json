        "transcript": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Hang is leaving no prisoners with this one simple observation. Find him a single startup that says they have enough compute capacity. You can't. And Lisa Sue is backing that up with numbers that sound made up. AMD needs to deliver 100 times more compute than exists on the planet today within 5 years. These aren't projections from Jensen Huang and Lita Sue. They're describing demand that exists today. And then I have a third bonus kit from Jensen Huang featuring at the end. >> The amount of computing demand is insane. >> Mhm. >> Give me an example of a startup company that goes, \"No, we're good.\" >> They are all dying for computing capacity. Give me an example for a researcher in any university, a scientist in any company who says got plenty of capacity. Everybody is dying for capacity. And so we have a global multi- company multi-industry shortage. It's not just about open AI even though open AI could use a lot more capacity as well. So I think I think how we think about this what what the narrative the narrative is not helpful and it's a little bit too superficial to say how do you prove there's an AI bubble billion dollars of revenues hundreds of billions of dollar infrastructure being built is a little bit too simplistic. >> Yeah. Yeah. The other thing people um tend to point out is the MIT study. There there's some study that I think came out of MIT that claimed that most enterprise deployments of AI weren't that useful. And you're like, well, did you do the change management? Did you do a reorg? Did you integrate into tooling? Did you like how long did it even take to implement it? If a planning cycle in an enterprise is a year, is it something in six months? And so it feels like there's a lot of these kind of again overstated things that get a lot of attention, but then you map it against what's actually happening. >> Yeah. >> And the growth of these companies using AI and it's just a completely different world. And and and if you want to find out where the world's innovation's happening, I would not go find out at an enterprise. >> Would you guys agree? >> Yeah. >> Enterprise is like the slowest adopters of new technologies. I would go talk to all of the startups, the 30, 40,000 startups that are currently doing this stuff. I would go talk to Open Evans. How how's it working? I would go go talk to cursor. How's coding working by the way? You know, I would just go talk to these people. >> I think it's really interesting that you see that. Um, of course you do have companies making, you know, hundred million dollar plus, multiund million dollar plus progress of AR in enterprise sales, Harvey, Sierra, etc. But some of the fastest growing companies have been enduser adopted even in conservative industries, right? Like healthcare, you know, skeptical industries like >> healthare the most, right? The most conservative of all. But guess what? They are so concerned about getting the right answer [clears throat] >> that the ability to have something like open evidence. >> Yeah. >> To do grounded research, high quality research and get that get that research as information to you. Nobody wants to do research. They want answers. Nobody wants to do search. They want answers. Is that right? >> Bridge is a great example of that too where they're basically making it really easy to do the physician notes instead of the physician sitting there and doing it. Back to your point on task versus >> task versus purpose. Exactly. And I think a different way to think about the demand is like there are so many jobs where you're asking the the work is actually like an impossible ask right of a doctor or a radiologist keep up with the world's biomedical knowledge in R&D which is accelerating you know computing and otherwise um and then >> archive papers. Yeah. There was a time you s you and I read and read. You and I both both used to do I don't do that anymore but here now now I just load it all into chatbt >> you know now I just load it all in what all of the the ones that are interesting and and I make it learn it. >> Yeah >> and then I you know make it summarize and another summary and I I interact with it. But but the point is uh we used to do search. We don't do it that anymore. I don't do search uh we used to do research. You know, the goal is to get answers. The goal is to get smarter. And these AIs allow us to help us do all that. And I think all of it all of it comes back. We it it's all more helpful if you come back to the framework that says AI is a multi-layer cake >> and that AI is not just a chatbot. AI is very very diverse in all of the industries and modalities and information and applications that it addresses. When you think about wanting to win >> that America should win AI, it should not just be America should have this company win AI. >> The AI comput shortage is universal. Not a single startup, researcher, or scientist anywhere has enough capacity, which makes the bubble narratives completely miss what's actually happening. Jensen's challenging anyone to find a startup that says they're good on compute or a researcher who has plenty of capacity. He's saying they don't exist. Jensen points out the 12 billion in revenue versus hundreds of billions of AI infrastructure is way too superficial. Ignores that enterprises are the slowest adopters while 30 to 40,000 startups are building on this stuff right now. Companies like open evidence in healthcare show how people don't want to do research anymore. They want answers. The demand is real because every layer of the market is capacity constrained simultaneously. Startups would scale faster if they could get more compute. Open AI could use multiples of what they have today. Even conservative industries like healthcare are adopting fast once they see the value. doctors using AI tools to keep up with biomedical research they couldn't possibly read themselves or systems handling physician notes so doctors could focus on patients instead of paperwork. Jens's point about enterprises being slow adopters is crucial for understanding the demand curve. We're not waiting for big companies to validate AI. They're going to be late to everything as per usual. The innovation is happening at the startups right now and those companies are all hitting compute walls. When people point to studies showing AI deployment in enterprises not being useful, they're missing the context. Did they do change management? Did they recognize workflows? How long did implementation actually take? Most enterprises planning cycles are a year. So measuring results after 6 months tells you nothing. The narrative about an AI bubble assumes demand is speculative. But when every startup building on this technology would consume 10x their current capacity tomorrow if they could get it, that's not speculation. When researchers are loading dozens of papers into chat GPD instead of trying to read them all manually because the AI synthesizes information they can't process themselves. That's real utility creating real demand. When healthcare workers are using tools that give them grounded research and answers instead of making them weighed through search results. That's solving a natural problem. And the shift from search to answers is fundamental. Nobody wants to search anymore. They want answers. Nobody wants to do research. They just want the information. Jetson used to read archive papers himself. Now he loads everything into a GPT and interacts with it to learn. That's not a marginal improvement to work. That's a complete change into how knowledge work happens. When you multiply that shift through millions of professionals who all face the same problem, too much information, not enough time. The demand for compute to power those AI systems becomes massive. Before I take you to the next clip, I spend a lot of time finding these clips for you guys. If you appreciate it, why not consider hitting subscribe? >> So, your last generation of real world deployed gear, something's coming that's a thousand times better. How did you make it a thousand times better? >> It it is just incredible engineering at every level. So, MI455 is 10 times better than the chip that we just launched uh 6 months ago, the MI355. And MI500 is another 10x, you know, on top of that. uh we are using the most advanced technology out there. We have a a very um you know very clear focus on you know hardware software uh system code design and um it is um you know clearly the pushing the bleeding edge of capability. If you think today they're probably you know more than a billion active users uh using AI and we expect that to scale to over five billion users over the next 5 years. So for all of that you need compute and lots and lots of compute and um from that standpoint you know MI455 is a um significant leap forward um in terms of technology capability you know made up of two and three nanometer chips 320 billion transistors just a lot of performance and a lot of >> what's the timeline for it to be deployed in the real world then and then who will be the principal first user of it >> you'll see it in the second half of 26 and uh it will ramp from there and you know we have um you know very strong partnerships um OpenAI Greg Brockman was on stage uh with us last night uh talking about all the use cases that they see we've announced a partnership with Oracle many others um as well >> so given that it it is 2 it's in full production now it's getting ready to >> we are we are absolutely getting ready uh to to ship it one of the things that we're so clear about is that the demand for AI compute is just continuing to increase and you know we have seen that over the last 5 years when you think about just how much um you know new capabilities have come on board we've now seen um a real inflection in the number of people who are using AI so if you think today they're probably you know more than a billion active users uh using AI and we expect that to scale to over five billion users over the next 5 years so for all of that you need compute and lots and lots of compute and um from that standpoint you know MI455 is a um significant leap forward um in terms terms of technology capability, you know, made up of two and three nanometer chips, 320 billion transistors, just a lot of performance and a lot of >> I often ask you to quantify demand, but is there a way to quantify the severity in the lack of compute, you know, the deficit that's out there right now? >> Well, let me just give you some numbers to kind of ground what we think the demand environment is um is looking like. So if you think you know today uh we have about a billion active users and we're ramping that to you know 5 billion over the next 5 years uh and we have about let's call it a 100red zenoflops of compute you know all around the world and that's just a a generic number uh that uh that aggregates all of that you know we think we have to increase compute by another 100 times as you go over the next you know four or five years and um I introduced a term um last night. [clears throat] Uh the yata flop, you know, people are like, \"What is a yata flop?\" A yata flop is actually 10 to the 24th in terms of flops. So that's a one followed by 24 zeros. And to give you, you know, just a view of just how much things have really increased, I mean, that's another hundred times more compute um than we have today. So that gives you an idea. Now you think, what are you going to use all that compute for? I mean, the truth is the models that we have today are great. I mean they they do amazing things. Um you know we talked about a number of use cases. Uh you know perhaps um you know one that's you know very hits very close to home is is uh writing software like you know people are using uh the AI tools right now to significantly enhance the productivity of uh software developers. But it's good but it can get so much better. And I mean I think that's the key point. You know, we we like to say that AI is really going to be everywhere and it's really for everyone and it's for each one of us to make our businesses more productive, you know, each one of us um more productive, you know, going forward. And so, we're still in the very early innings of really unlocking the power of AI. >> AMD is staring at demand that requires building 100 times more compute than exists on Earth today. and they're responding with chip improvements so fast that a product launched six months ago is already way slower than what's coming. Lisa Su lays out the demand environment AMD is seeing 1 billion people actively using AI today scaling to 5 billion users within 5 years. So with this huge demand in front of them, AMD's response is wild. The MI455, which is AMD's flagship data center chip, launching late in 2026, is 10 times better than MI355, which just shipped 6 months ago. Then MI500 is another 10x improvement. Those improvement numbers are hard to wrap your head around. A 10x performance jump every 6 months to a year means the chip you just launched basically becomes obsolete by the time the customers get their hands on the new stuff. And then you stack another 10x on top of that and we're talking about a 100x total improvement in roughly a year or two depending on how you take the timelines. Traditional semiconductor advancements never moved anywhere close to this pace. Mo's law was about doubling every 18 months or so and AMD is blowing past that at an order of magnitude. What makes this possible is the combination of advanced manufacturing and system level design. These chips use 2nm and 3 nanometer processing technology. the smallest, most advanced nodes available. You're packing 320 billion transistors into a single chip. But they're not just shrinking components, they're redesigning how hardware and software work together from the ground up. When Lisa Sue talks about hardware software co-design, she means AMD is optimizing every layer simultaneously to squeeze out maximum performance. The demand justifies this breakneck pace. AMD knows with certainty they can sell every chip they can manufacture because customers are placing orders years in advance for products that don't exist yet. Open AAI doesn't wait to see benchmarks. They commit to partnerships before the chip even ships because they know they'll need the capacity regardless. Oracle is doing the same thing. When you've got customers willing to lock in orders that far ahead, you can afford to take big risks on aggressive development timelines. And the scale AMD is targeting makes sense once you understand where AI usage is heading. Going from 1 billion to 5 billion users in 5 years isn't some moonshot projection. It's what happens when AI tools move from early adopters to mainstream. When coding assistants become standard for every software developer, when doctors use AI for every diagnosis, when every knowledge worker has an AI assistant they interact with dozens of times per day, that level of adoption requires compute infrastructure that doesn't exist yet. which is why AMD needs to deliver hardware that's 100 times more powerful than what we have today. Check out this bonus clip from Jensen. >> A friend of mine has a saying that uh doomers are the people who sound smart at dinner parties and optimists are the people who drive humanity forward. And I think that's very true for for all these things we've talked about. Yeah. >> So yeah, it's really true. >> Yeah. >> Well, that that's one of the big big um takeaways for for uh this last year, the battle of narratives >> and it's too simplistic. um to say that everything that the doomers are saying are irrelevant. That's not true. A lot of very sensible things are being said. Um it is too simplistic to say that when somebody is optimistic that they're just naive. It >> needs to be grounded in reality. >> Yes. That optimistic people are just naive, you know, >> and that that's obviously not true. Um but I think we just have to be mindful of the balance of it >> when 90% of the messaging is all around the end of the world and do and the pessimism and you know I I think we we're scaring people >> from making the investments in AI that makes it safer, more functional, more productive >> and more useful to society. And so we just you know more secure, you know, all of that takes technology, security takes technology, safety takes technology. I appreciate that my car is safer today because it has better technology than a car 50 years ago. >> And so so I I think it takes technology to be safe, technology to be secure. And so I I'm I'm I'm delighted to see that the the advancement of technology is still accelerating and ongoing. And so we just have to make sure that the the policy makers around the world, the governments um are able to are are thinking about balancing these two ideas. How do you So, I guess we've talked a lot about 25 >> and the narratives of 25, but how do you think about 26? What are you excited about? What do you see coming? What do you think are big changes that we should be aware of? >> I am optimistic that that um our relationship with China will improve >> that President Trump and the administration um has a really really grounded and common sense um attitude about um and philosophy around around how to think about China. uh that that they're an adversary >> um but they're also also a partner in many ways and that the idea of decoupling is naive and the idea of decoupling um for whatever reason philosophical reasons or national security reasons it's just not not it's not based on any common sense and the more you the more deeply you look into it the more the two countries are actually highly coupled >> [clears throat] >> um both countries out of out invest in their own independence. Um I you know when you depend too much on someone the relationship becomes too emotional uh as you know and so it's good to have some independence and or as much independence as either either would like but to recognize that there's a lot of coupling a lot of dependence between the two countries and and I think there's a there needs to be a nuanced strategy a nuanced attitude about how to how to how to manage this relationship in a productive way for all of the people of two countries and for all of the people around the world, everybody depends on a productive, constructive relationship of the two most important nations and the single most important relationship for the next century. And so, we have to find that answer. And I'm I'm I just really delighted uh that President Trump is looking for a constructive answer. And so, I I think that next year uh will be a much better better better year than the last several. >> Picture this.

        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I've got two huge clips for you today. One from Jamal Patty Hapeteer who's diving into chips and then another from Kathy Wood who breaks down one of the most important reasons as to why we might be on the cusp of an economic boom in America. >> Chips Act is is very different than how it started. >> So, is that fair? >> Yeah, because the Biden administration viewed the $50 billion as I'll give you 10%. you build a $16 billion plant, I'll give you $6 billion. And uh >> And why does that not work? Like why why would that not have worked or why was that not working when you came in? >> Why would you give $6 billion to TSMC, which is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, when their stock is worth a trillion, right? [laughter] >> So what Donald Trump does is says, \"Hey, hey, how about this? How about this? I'll charge you a 100% tariff. How about that? And then the guy says, \"Okay, I'll build an America.\" See, I don't have to give you six billion. Like, you know, Donald Trump can dissect it. >> Yeah. >> Right. In a paragraph. >> Yeah. >> In a paragraph. >> Right. >> So, what we did is we we said to TSMC, \"Look, you signed the contract. There's 20 pages of DEI stuff in. >> You need to hire a blind stuff. >> Oh, you have to hire a blind contractor. You have to have like >> uh you know trans lesbian engineers. I'm not kidding by the way. And you know so think about the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Corporation, right? How many lithography engineers does Taiwan have that are female? Let alone what their sexuality choices are. >> Right? >> They've never had a female. They're all men. >> So I said, \"Listen, you're in breach, >> right? Everybody thinks like a Republican will just rip that stuff up. Not this kind of Republican. This kind of Republican reads the contract and says, you know, you >> you're in breach of the DEI company. >> You didn't build a daycare center in the middle of your clean room fab. Like you signed that contract, so you're in breach. Okay. So, how about this? How about I add 100 billion. So, instead of building 60 billion, you build 160 billion, >> right? >> And we agreed. So, I feel better. >> And then, do you wave the DEI requirements? >> Hey, build another hundred billion. We can rip that stuff up. No problem. So, what happens is you now have a $165 billion plant going in. And I think I'm going to let TSC TSMC announce it, but they are going to get much bigger even from the 165 billion the and this is remember this is a factory. >> Yeah. that makes the stuff that Nvidia sells for five times higher. >> Okay, let's talk about Nvidia for a second. You did a deal at the end of this year. I don't think we've ever seen a deal like this and you can tell me if it's wrong, but you control the export licenses and as you said, Jimoth, we don't want our adversaries to get the most advanced silicon, which makes sense. And then you struck an agreement with Jensen where now I think it's the H200's. Yes. which are not quite the most advanced chips but maybe one generation before China >> advanced than what China makes >> right but in return you got a 25% marketing fee what do you call it rev share >> tariff >> tariff just describe to us the construction of that deal and what it means for these kinds of deals in the future >> so Jensen Wang who runs Nvidia is you obviously a businessman of extraordinary capacity. You can't run a $5 trillion company unless you're like >> incredibly impressive. >> Impressive. So he comes in and and I promised him in the beginning when I first met him that I would help him have really easy access to the president because he's a national treasure. >> Yeah. >> Right. And and our great companies are national treasures for America. So, so he his argument to the president buy it or not is that if you shut off China entirely, then all of their n all of their economics go to their national champion to build new stuff and all their economics go to that company and that helps that company grow. And that if you give them better than what they have, you don't have to give them your best, you just have to give them better than what they have. >> Right? This is his argument. Then they'll give less to their champion, >> right? >> And more to you and and it it'll have a positive economic relationship with China and positive for us overall. Now there are plenty of people who disagree right but that was Jensen's argument and that was the discussion the argument the debate that we had and then when that was done and over then the president said and you got to give me 25%. So the 25% was a throwaway >> right >> but it was like look if I'm doing all this for you you still got to give me 25%. So the way we're doing it is he has to send the chips to America. We test the chip to make sure that he hasn't enhanced it in any way. >> Okay. >> Cuz the H20 was oddly enhanced. You know that it had >> it had less flops but more >> memory. In fact, it had more memory than the H100, which one could argue was a little, you know, not everybody knew that. Say it that way. So we test it on the way in. We could charge it a tariff just [snorts] regular 25% tariff and then we give export licenses to who he wants to >> and then he sends it to China and then >> and he sends it to China or he sends it, you know, whoever he's selling it to. So I think we the president this is the president's deal and and my job is to make sure all the smart people are in the room with with both opinions. >> Howard Lutnik just walked through how Trump's team renegotiated the TSMC deal. Instead of the US government paying them billions to build in America, they threatened tariffs and got TSMC to commit $165 billion instead of 60. Then with Nvidia, the government also worked out something interesting. Jensen, Nvidia CEO, can sell H200 chips to China, which is one generation behind the current tech, but is still better than what China can make domestically in exchange for a 25% tariff with all chips being tested in the US first to make sure they haven't been enhanced. So firstly, the subsidy approach which assumed you had to pay companies to do what you want. If you're a government, the US government was going to pay TSMC6 billion and then maybe they would build a $60 billion fab in Arizona. But the new approach completely flipped that. Threats from tariffs got them to commit almost three times as much capital. TSMC has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. They didn't need American subsidies. They need American markets. And then the Nvidia deal is also pretty significant long-term as well. Nvidia CEO and Jensen Wang's argument makes complete sense to me. If you completely cut off China from advanced chips, all of their R&D money will flow to their own domestic champions trying to catch up with America. Give them access to chips which are better than what they can make in house, but they're not America's absolute best. And Chinese companies keep buying from Nvidia and other companies like AMD instead of funding local competitors. This means China will be spending money on Nvidia chips instead of investing billions trying to replicate them. The 25% tariff is an interesting part. Revenue flows to the US government every time one of these high performance AI chips crosses the border into China. And requiring chips to route through US testing facilities first means America sees everything which is being sold. How much to whom and whether the specs match what was approved. Some people will say selling any advanced chips to China is risky. Maybe. But the alternative is China pours everything into domestic chip development and eventually gets there anyway just without America making money or maintaining visibility into what they're buying and building. This approach keeps America companies competitive, generates tariff revenue, and maintains US control over the most critical technology infrastructure in the world. Way better positioning than hoping subsidies. I think both these situations have been handled pretty well so far. It's way better than hoping subsidies bring companies to the states and export bans somehow stop China from developing their own capabilities. Speaking of chips and AI, I made a course on AI I wish I had when I first started researching the topic. If you want to get lifetime access, check out the link below. Heads up, the price goes up when we add new modules and we'll be adding something soon. Now to Kathy Wood. 2026 uh is in the US the midterm elections uh and President Trump does not want to be a lame duck. So I have a feeling uh that he is going to work uh with his crypto and AISAR right uh to to do a few things. one, make sure we get that dimminimous uh uh ruling through uh make sure so because you know grassroots is where a lot of what we've been talking about is going to happen. Um but also it seems as though there's been reticence about actually buying Bitcoin for the strategic reserve. So far so far it's confiscated. uh the original intent was to own a million Bitcoin. So I I actually think they will start buying because I think this will help Trump in a couple of ways. The midterm elections, part of the reason he won uh won the presidency, I think, was the crypto community. Um% yes. And uh another reason of course is his family is all in on Bitcoin and and other uh crypto assets and uh they have you know we talked about the DATs earlier. They've kind of fallen apart this year. So um I think he's got all kinds of reasons to do this but the most important one is he does not want to be a lame duck. He wants to have another one or two productive years. And uh I think I think he sees crypto as as a path to the future. >> Kathy, just like I think David Sax said that it had it had to be fiscally neutral to be able to do you think they're going to >> budget budget neutral. >> Budget neutral, right? Budget neutral. >> Budget neutral. The second thing that I think we'll see next year is a big surprise in GDP growth because of the OB3 and the corporate tax deductions. like our corporate tax rate in the United States, the effective tax rate has dropped to 10%. Which is the lowest in the world for any developed country. Uh so I think the and and we have accelerated depreciation as the primary reason. You put a manufacturing facility in the US. Think this about Bitcoin about this Bitcoin miners. You put a manufacturing facility in the US. uh if you start building it by the end of 28, you in the first year of service will be able to depreciate it 100% in year one, not over 30 to 40 years. So you get huge tax refunds. Uh so I think we're going to see massive growth and the deficit uh they're going to have more degrees of freedom to in which to work. Now >> I think a good way to start would be buying Micro Strategy, right? They have 600k Bitcoin. So if you want to get to a million that's an easy place to go, right? [laughter] >> I'll just add one more thing because you spurred another thought. >> In our early days with Bitcoin, we thought we thought that uh countries would adopt it uh uh much earlier than they have. Um and that that we could have an emerging market uh currency crisis as a result. Um, I think if the US actually says, \"Okay, now we're going to buy.\" That's going to spur a lot of other governments to think this thing through, do they want to be hostage to the dollar, you know, and moni US monetary policy? And, you know, no, they don't. So, put some Bitcoin in uh in your reserves. um that could in turn uh really create you know get us much closer to really very few currencies that really matter. one of them Bitcoin. Uh I think dollar will still be you know I think the dollar especially with the stable coin movement will be the other but the emerging market currencies I think uh could could experience uh some serious downside volatility if this happens. >> Super boring but super important. The 100% first year depreciation rule just have made America the cheapest place in the world to build new factories and most people have no idea this is happening. Kathy mentioned that America's effective corporate tax rate dropped to 10% which is lower than any other developed country. But the bigger deal is accelerated depreciation. Okay, it sounds super boring but this stuff is critical. If you start building a manufacturing facility by the end of 2028, you can depreciate 100% of the cost in the first year of operation instead of spreading over let's say 30 or 40 years. That creates massive tax refunds immediately. Most people think tariffs are bringing back manufacturing to the US. Tariffs are helping. But this depreciation thing is way more powerful. Say you're Intel and build a $20 billion chip fab in Ohio. Under the old rules, you would depreciate that over 30 or 40 years. So you get, let's say, $500 billion in deductions per year. Under the new rules, you write off the entire $20 billion in year 1. If you're profitable elsewhere, that $20 billion deduction wipes out taxes on other income immediately. The government basically funds a huge chunk of your factory through tax refunds. Companies optimize for after tax returns. A factory that costs $20 billion but generates a $7 billion tax refund in year 1 effectively costs $13 billion. That changes every single calculation about where to build. Europe can't match this. Their corporate tax rates run 20 to 30% and they don't allow this kind of accelerated depreciation. China has cheap labor, but their effective tax situation for foreign companies is complicated and risky. So, America just became the obvious choice for anyone building serious manufacturing infrastructure. And Kathy's connecting this to GDP growth and deficits. When companies build a $20 billion factory in Ohio instead of Taiwan, that's construction jobs, engineering jobs, supply chain jobs, all the support infrastructure, that shows up as GDP growth. And higher GDP means more tax revenue overall, even with lower rates and accelerated depreciation. The government loses revenue in year 1 from the depreciation, but gains it back over time from all the economic activity the factory receives. The timing on this is super important. companies have until the end of 2028 to break ground. So, every major manufacturer is racing to get projects started before that deadline. TSMC, Samsung, Intel, they're all committing to massive US facilities right now. And I want to make this clear. This isn't about Trump or Biden or policies. This is pure economics. Someone made the US the most attractive place to build factories by changing the tax code and capital is flowing to America because of it. 10 years from now, when people ask why advanced manufacturing came back to America, the answer probably isn't going to be tariffs or national security, it's going to be the boring depreciation rule. And nobody outside of a few CFOs really understood. Cheers. Picture this. A potential client searches for what your business offers and your YouTube video appears. Before they've even booked a call, they've built trust with you, turning them into a warm lead. That's why our clients are hitting $100,000 months because YouTube turns attention into authority. If you run a business, book a call and I'll show you exactly how to make this"
