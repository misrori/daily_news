        "transcript": "Imagine being one of Bitcoin's first true believers. You got your hands on 371,000 BTC when no one was paying attention. Enough to make you one of the richest people alive. But then you lose it all. Not in a hack, not from losing your keys, but by getting caught trying to blackmail a presidential candidate with a fake ransom note and some cat photos. This is the alleged wild story of Michael Manel"
