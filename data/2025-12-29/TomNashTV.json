        "transcript": "So despite all the doom and gloom we heard throughout 2025 and mainly through the April crash, the year still ended up being about 18% which is phenomenal, almost doubled on the average. The market kind of did its thing again like it usually does and next year you're going to hear a lot of doom and gloomers pretty much do the same thing again and again. Wax on, wax off like karate kid. Now, in this video, I'm going to lay out my plans for 2026, my market outlook, and what to watch out from because listening to the wrong people instead of having your own method, your own system, and your own process is actually very, very expensive, and it may cost you a lot of money. So, listen to this video. Don't click nothing. Don't smash nothing. Don't buy nothing. I'm going to lay out everything. Now, first and foremost, let's start with recapping this year as we're about three days removed from 2026. So my year has been phenomenal. We up 150% on Palunteer this year. We're up more than 20% on Tesla and up about 18% on S&P 500. My portfolio is well known. 40% Palanteer, 40% SP 500, and 20% Tesla. So I had a phenomenal year. We have absolutely smashed it in the community over the R Academy. My students are a great year and all the doom and gloomers are basically left complaining. Now, the thing is, we're not here to talk about what happened in 2025. At this point, in about 72 hours, it's going to be pretty much irrelevant. We're here to talk about the 2026 outlook. And even though I hate to admit it, I see a lot of issues with 2026 boiling and heating up, which I want to talk to you about ahead of time because on this channel, and this community, we really don't try to predict nothing. will occasionally dabble in a little bit of guesstimating about what might or might not happen, but we're not in the business of making money off of predictions. We are preparing for each scenario so we can think, act, and react accordingly. We don't predict, we prepare. So, first and foremost, let's talk about what I see for 2026. Now, the markets still have a massive upside for 2026, and that is a statement that's going to be correct for every single year, no matter what happened before, no matter what the circumstances are. It's pretty insane to me that people forget the fact that the market is positive in 75% of years, 3/4 of years in the existence of the market, we had positive returns. And yet, people want to gamble against the stock market. So, one thing I want you guys to understand, no matter what the risks we're going to cover in today's video, no matter what we're going to scare you about and all this stuff, being a bear doesn't pay. Being a bear is a very, very bad business in the US stock market. It's not me saying that. That's just number and data, statistics, and history. So, if 75% of years are positives, how many decades do you think are positive on the S&P 500? I'm going to give you a minute to think about it. Meanwhile, without you googling, by the way, I'm going to let you know it's about 90%. 90% of decades are positive. What kind of an idiot would bet against the market long term? I don't understand. By the way, we have never in history, no matter how you slice and dice, no matter how you cut it, you will never find a 20-year period that was negative on the S&P 500. It does not exist. In fact, if you started investing the day before the com crash and you stopped investing at the bottom of the 2022 bare market and all you did is continue to put in a $100 every month to the S&P 500, you're up 350%. By the way, so and that is with the last decade, which is the possible worst case you can think of. So, number one, let's set the stage here that being a market bearer does not pay the bills. And I'm saying this not to dunk on anybody. I'm saying this to kind of explain to you that being a market bear and pissing against the wind is pretty much the same thing. It does not pay. Sometimes you get it right, but nine out of 10 times if you're looking at decades, you're going to be off. So, it pays to be a bull. But being a bull doesn't mean you have to be an idiot. Being a bull doesn't mean you have to be carefree and ignore the risks and just hope that the profit fairy is going to come in and make you rich and wealthy. No, being a bull means you still have to be smart, logical, and manage risks because crashes happen and downturns happen and you have to prepare accordingly. Right now, the macroeconomic data is pretty robust and it shows us that the US market, despite some issues with the labor market, is still holding on strong. Whether it's GDP, whether it's inflation, whether it's consumer strength, right now the US economy is still doing very well. And it's very hard to imagine that we're going to have a major horrible year, you know, if the economy remains robust because at the end of the day, the stock market has to be a reflection of the economy. Now, again, one of the things I preach is, you know, you don't fight the Fed and it's pretty stupid to fight somebody who owns the money printer. And the Fed is in the process of turning on that printer again. So, with the Fed cutting rates and with the Fed essentially putting more money into the system, it's kind of silly to go all bearish right now out of the gate. With quantitative tightening pretty much ending and QE starting, it wouldn't be the wisest bet to go super bearish right now on January 2026. Right now, we're talking about a lot of headwinds that people are seeing as far as inflation may be coming back, as far as all the stuff. We'll talk about it, but it's very hard to fight against the Fed money machine, and that's a very powerful thing to have on your side if you're a bull. So, basically, this means that the money will keep flowing to the AI sector, which is going to grease every wheel in existence because the AI companies, they have to hire, they have to spend more money in equipment, etc., etc. The money trickles down the system. So, as AI capex is continuing to happen, which seems to be the case for another six months at the very least, the earnings and the profits will look great. On top of it, and I talked about it before, you see, there's also the matter of looking into history and saying, well, you know, this is going to be the fourth year of a bull cycle. We had three consecutive years of really outsized gains. I mean, how many times in history that happened? And if you look at the past 40 years, we had four times that we had five consecutive bull years, which means half the time, 20 out of 40 years, we were in a fiveyear bull cycle. So, it's not unusual. It's not something to be feared, and it's not something to panic about, right? So, number one, relax. Number two, let's look at the facts. Obviously, the fact that I'm saying these bullish statements doesn't mean there aren't risks. And I pointed them out before, but there are inherent risks in this market the same way we had them 6 months ago, the same way we had them 12 months ago. Now, number one is obviously the Japan carry trade. And for those of you who are not versed in the Japanese interest rates, essentially this is a lot of traders on the US side that found the infinite money glitch in real life essentially where they borrow cheap yen and convert it to free money. And every time we have this setup where the money fairy just comes in and spreads money on people. That's something to be feared about. The Japanese carrier trade, if you're interested in the story, you can dig in. But basically, if this thing unwinds and implodes, the fallout on the US stock market is going to be quite severe. And that's something that's been around for a while now. It's not news, right? On top of this, the AI capex cycle, which we're talking about here, you know, at some point it may slow down. And if it does, then a lot of these assumptions we have right now may have to shrink in 6 months, 9 months, 12 months. That's something to consider. It's not going to continue this way for ages and ages and ages. At some point you have to have you're bound to have a slowdown in the capex cycle and of course we will have some job loss because AI is essentially taking over jobs both on manufacturing both on retail side hospitality the food and beverage industry and so forth and so forth and with higher interest and loss of employment well there's some stflation risks we talked about it these risks are not new none of this is something that we didn't know 6 months ago but it is something to be aware of I wouldn't base my investing strategy based on these inherent risks. I would acknowledge them and manage them accordingly and I'll talk to you in a second how to manage these risks. But there are more specific risks to be aware of as you're looking into 2026. Obviously, we have basically the job market showing some weakness and a lot of people just want to, you know, brush this under the rug and essentially ignore this. I don't think that there something to be ignored about. I've been on record talking about this point many, many times before. The job market unemployment essentially is a very tricky thing to measure because it seems like nothing. And when it starts to slow down, it seems meaningless and almost marginal. You won't know it because it will seem basically almost unimportant and irrelevant and tiny until you hit that boiling point, the point of no return, which is something that is there and is supposed to be a concerning matter to a lot of folks. And yet it is absolutely ignored and written off by basically saying well you know just the 4 and a half% employment nothing to worry about. No no no I think that the job market slowing down is something to pay attention to not to panic over of course but it is there and it is a serious concern. On top of this obviously I mentioned this earlier we have higher higher higher money flowing into the stock market free money cheap money whatever you want to call it. And as we have this free money flowing into the stock market well you know what's going to happen? And you have a lot of retail participation. A lot of investors, let's call them this way, that are not really good long-term investors. They're more based on hype and euphoria. A lot of them will see the neighbor is buying a Lambo or a McLaren or whatever these days the kids are buying. I don't know. Your neighbor gets rich, your carpenter gets rich, everybody's making money by doing nothing in the stock market. more people will pile into the stock market which will bring even crazier valuations, even more hype, even less foundational uh you know intrinsic values and all that. And every time that happens in history, usually doesn't end well. Which basically means that yes, we are bullish as we should be about 2026 because that's a smart thing to do in every year. But there are risks that are quite serious. risks that have been around for a year, maybe more, and also risks that we have started to develop recently like the euphoria in the stock market, like retail participation, like some of the things we've been saying about the decay in the job market. All of these things, they start to build up and as they start to build up, we have more and more risks to manage. Now, smart investors, long-term investors also are aware of risks and they take measures to mitigate set risks. No smart investor in history has ever said, \"Well, I'm just gonna hope it'll wait.\" Now, a lot of people think they can just ride it out, whatever happens, without managing any risks. And I heard this sentence for many investors over the past 3 years saying, \"Well, you know, I don't care. The market drops 80%, I'm going to just sit there, wait it out, no problemmo, everything will be fine.\" And while it is factually true for most of good companies that over time these corrections will bounce and you've seen an example of this with Palunteer going from 40 to six then to 200. It doesn't mean that you can do it. It's like saying well you know I've seen this show the deadliest catch and I think I can do it. I think I can be a tuna fisherman out in the sea. Uh, you know, it looks easy on TV and it seems easy when you're sitting in your air conditioned home eating a bunch of Twinkies on your couch watching this on TV, but when you're out there on that boat in freezing weather risking your life to catch king crab, uh, it's a whole different enchilada, my friend. So, maybe some of you can't do it. I would bet 80% of you are not going to make it, are not going to think it's a good idea, will not ever want to do it again. Okay, the same thing with the stock market. none of you have seen. And here's the uncomfortable truth, which is that most of you have not seen or smelt a real crash. And if you think that 2022 was it, you're wrong. It was a bump in the road. A real crash like 2008 feels horrible. It feels like the world will never be the same. It feels absolutely depressing. I'm just saying that you have to be open to the possibility that this very, very extreme event can happen at any point in time and you have to prepare. You can't ignore it and hope it's not going to happen. Now, I said that as we go into year four of this bull cycle with all this retail euphoria and the job market, and I've laid it out in a different video, the risk of a serious correction, of a serious pullback into the second half of 2026 is very, very much elevated and I stand behind that assessment. But my strategy isn't to sell everything and to run for the hills. In fact, my strategy is very simple. I'm going to think, act, and react. And it's very, very simple. Once I see the triggering points of the market start to flash red, for example, I see retail piling in without recognition. I see people bragging about making 50% in 3 months. I see that everybody's on margin. I see that valuations are going into the 50s and the 60s on the SP500. And I basically see the sentiment that we cannot lose and we're heading into a 20-y year bull market. I know this is the point. We're getting close to that boiling point we don't want to be at. Right? Until that happens, I'm going to continue to do my thing, which is to dollar cost average. And actually, I want to give you that guide for free on how to DCA dollar cost average every single day and how to make sure you are well prepared for whatever happens. In the description below, there is a link. Go get it right now. There is a complete a toz tutorial on how to dollar cost average, how to dca my system, my 20% double down system which I actually teach at the academy. Get it right now for free because I want everybody to have that. The link is in the description and in the pin comment. Go get it. It is absolutely free. Don't worry, it's yours. Now, this system is beautiful because what it does essentially, it puts you outside the fear of the market potentially crashing. We use the system in 2022 to make insane returns. And guess what? When the market actually drops a lot further than what happened in 2022, when we see a real crash, the bounce back and the correction and the money that will be made by people who make the right decisions during the crash will be much higher than what we made in 2022. Now, it seems like a lot of money now with Palanteer going 1500% with Tesla and this, yeah, we get it, right? But if we have a serious crash and you use this DCA system, which is by the way again for free in the description, the returns are going to be insane because the market always always rewards the patient long-term investors. And beyond the guide, which again is free for everyone, here's a few tricks which will help you to stay grounded and to manage this risk. Number one, you have to remind yourself every day the importance of long-term horizon and the long-term mindset. Number two is to trim profits. If you are up a lot, take 20% off. If the stock keeps on flying, you still have 80 cents on the dollar on the stock. And if it crashes, you at least have something to protect you. You have to also reduce your portfolio fragility. I talked about it many times before. Get rid of debt. Get rid of margin. You lose control over your investments if you have margin. On top of that, you have to increase your diversification either by going for individual stocks that are defensive such as consumer staples, healthcare, telecom or buy the S&P 500 and diversify through holding the entire market. Instead of, you know, looking for the needle in the haststack, just own the hay stack. Add protections. We talked about it. Add some cockroach portfolio elements to your portfolio. Build up your cash pile so that you have both the protection for bad times and the dry powder to go in when the market actually drops. Now 2026 is shaping up to be a very abnormal year. It's going to have a lot of insanity. We're going to see markets go to new highs. It would not surprise me to see 8,500, even maybe 9,000 on the S&P 500. It also would not surprise me if the market crashes and if we have a major pullback in the second half of 2026. It's very important to manage both risks. It's important to stay grounded as the market keeps flying to new highs in the first half of 2026, maybe in the second half 26, as long as it continues. I don't know how long it's going to be, but when and if or if and when the market pulls back and starts to correct, you have to have your plan in place. You have to be ready and know exactly what you want to do. If that plan was formulated before the feet hit the shen when everything was Gucci, you'll be fine. If you try and scramble your way while this drop is going to be happening, it's going to be too late. This is why you need to do this right now. Go to the description, get my DCA guide. This DCA guide, dollar cost average, will show you how to invest in good times and bad times and how to ride the average and how to create a weighted average that's going to bring down your cost bases and get you more money and more profits in bad markets. This is for patient investors that want to use the next pullback to make generational wealth, which exactly what smart long-term DCA over decades is going to achieve for you. Now, again, in the description in the pin comment, go get it. I want everybody to have it is free. No strings attached. If you want to take, however, the next step and join the Ro Academy and learn how to be a better long-term investor and actually dedicate the time and resources to improving yourself. If you want to invest in yourself, to become a better investor, I encourage you to join the academy. We have 27 and a2 thousand students right now which are learning every single day how to create generational wealth over decades through smart long-term investing through responsible and actually logical investing through being an adult instead of all this in social media. If that sounds like something that interests you, I invite you to join. Try it out. We have a 30-day money back guarantee. No questions asked. Try it out. See if it's for you. And I would love to see you there. I'll see you in the next one. Be"
