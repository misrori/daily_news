        "transcript": "If you invest in the stock market right now, what I'm about to show you could either make you a fortune or cost you everything you've worked for in 2026. 2026 is shaping up to be a once in a decade, maybe even lifetime opportunity. The kind where massive fortunes are made and massive fortunes are lost. The S&P 500 has already surged 77% since October 2022 and it's positioned to surge another 20 to 30% in 2026. But, and this is critical, this exact pattern preceded every major market crash in modern history. We're talking about 2000, 2007, 2022 all over again. the difference this time. You're going to see it coming because Winston back there has done all the research for you. So, the market is literally about to hand you the biggest gains of the decade, followed by one of the most brutal corrections we've seen. By the end of this video, you know exactly how to position yourself to capture those massive 2026 gains by protecting yourself from the inevitable crash that follows. We learned the five warning signs to watch for, the exact strategy to profit for both scenarios, and most importantly, when to make your move. Now, I'm going to do one better for you. I'm going to give you a full workbook, including the five warning signs, what they are, checklists, and everything. That's completely free. That's in our free community at felixfriends.org/resource. And if you're wondering who the heck I am, my name is Felix Pin. I'm an ex-investment banker. I've seen how the big money really moves and I've watched institutional investors make and lose a lot of money and I'm also the founder of the goat academy where we've taught over 20,000 students so far how to trade more like the institutions do and I'm also the co-founder of tradevision.io where we track real-time market data institutional flows give you live news on your stocks and there's a crazy Christmas sale going on over there so check out the tradevision.io IO um Christmas offer for you. But this whole community is about one thing and one thing only, leveling the playing field between retail investors like you and the Wall Street giants. So we teach regular people how to beat Wall Street up their own game. And today I'm going to show you a setup that mirrors 2000, 2007, 2022, the three biggest market tops of the last 25 years. This isn't speculation. This is pattern recognition based on decades of market data. what you do with that information could set you up for well whatever you wanted to set you up for. If you want some help with that setup and how the institutions apply strategies, learn from real investment bankers, my mentors, well, if you're serious about your money, book a free strategy call with us. Learn more about our mentorship program. And to access that, including my milliondoll life trading experiment, you can book a call at fenix.org/freedom. that is also free of charge and completely risk-free. Now, where are we since October? The market's gone absolutely bananas. We're up 77% October 2022. A normal three-year period gives us about 30%. Right? So, we've done more than double that. Now, this doesn't automatically mean a crash is coming. And this most people go wrong. They see these massive gains and they think, \"We're due for a crash, panic.\" But that's actually not how markets work. Bull markets can run hot for years. In fact, if you look at the last 40 years of market history, about 50% of that time, we were in multi-year bull runs. The '9s saw 9-year bull market. The 2010 saw an 11-year bull market. So, the fact that we've gone up fast doesn't mean we're about to crash. The real question is, will we crash because we went up fast? No, it's not the real question. The real question is, what fundamentals are driving this rally? and what will make them break. That's what we're going to unpick in the next few minutes. Now, people are going to talk to you about PE ratios. They're going to say, \"Oh, the market PE right now is they're going to say the market PE right now is about 28. That's crazy.\" And so on. But that doesn't matter. Historically, the average PE has been lower. Yes, 16 to 17 historic. So, we're at a premium, but it doesn't matter once you understand what's driving this rally. There are two parts of that. One is the obvious, what everybody talks about, but I'm going to run you through that anyway just so you don't miss any of it. And then I'm going to tell you the not so obvious, which is what institutional money is watching. So the rocket fuel everyone's talking about is well AI infrastructure spending, right? We know that you know it's massive. Yes, in 2026 global spending on AI infrastructure is projected to hit 400 to 500 billion dollar. So that's a lot of money, right? semiconductors, power grid expansion, the whole stuff. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, and Meta, they're they're driving most of that. They're planning about 280 billion of that expenditure. Second, we got the Fed. The Fed's going to cut, right? Trump's going to appoint a Fed chess or a Fed poodle. Which one's right? I'm not sure. And then they're going to cut rates, right? Aggressively, we would imagine because that's that's the whole the whole point of this. Why do rate cuts matter? Well, they make borrowing cheaper for companies and for you. So, you spend more, the companies can invest more. Uh, and either way, companies make bigger profits, which means higher stock prices most likely. And then number third, that's you. We're counting on you, the retail investor FOMO. The fear and greed index sits at greed right now. And typically that means the retail money starts to pour in because we can go higher, we can go more extreme. But what happens is that the people who've sat out 2025 and there still are those people. Yes, there's still those people. They're going to start piling in. So they're going to see they made this maybe making money and they're going to, you know, they're going to start to put money in. So it's a self-fulfilling prophecy. More buyers push prices up and so on. It's it's it's, you know, the prediction. So my prediction for 2026, we're going to be up somewhere between, I don't know, 20 25 30%. Um, and that could be by mid or late 2026. I suspect it's going to come before the midterms. That'll be complete coincidence. By the way, the government obviously does not manipulate the stock market to win elections. That would be absurd, wouldn't it? And and and the more risky stocks could actually deliver much bigger returns than that. So, it's a it's a it's going to be a beautiful market. Now, before we get to the crash part, because there'll be a crash at some point, there are three hidden forces that have been driving stock prices higher and not Wall Street talks about it, but I don't really see this much talked about in mainstream media or on YouTube because it's sort of a bit more out there, but these forces, these buyers don't care about PE multipliers. They don't care about valuations. They just keep buying no matter what. The first of these secret forces are index funds. Now, do you own an index fund? Yes or no? Put it in the chat down the even if he said no, you probably do. Your your pension fund most certainly does. Um, so your 401k or whatever certainly has it in it. And they buy the stocks that are in the S&P 500, right? So, you buy an ETF like VU or something like that and it'll buy 500 companies. does not care what they're worth because those 500 own the S&P 500 can be super overvalued. They still have to buy it. But most of that money actually flows into the top 10 companies. Why does that happen? Well, Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Amazon, they get the line share of every dollar that flows into the index fund because they're the biggest stocks. So, there's this constant buying pressure on the biggest stocks which pushes them even higher. The second force is corporate buybacks. This year, companies bought $1 trillion of $1 trillion of their own shares. Nothing to do with fundamentals. When a company buys back its own stock, what happens? Less shares available. Less shares, same profits means PE looks better. It looks like there is profit growth. must be worth more, right? That's how companies pump their own stock. Now, why do they do this? Well, the cynic in me would say that CEOs in seuite are paid in stock options and they make more money if their stock prices is high, especially just before their options vest. Now there is research out there that would show a very odd coincidence that these buybacks are often timed with just before seuitees stock options vests. I'm sure it's a complete coincidence because of course the great and good American corporate world would not pump their own stock price for their own personal gain. Right? Don't think such thoughts. It's naughty. That's the second. So those guys are going to buy their own stocks. And again, who is the biggest buyback buyer? It's the top 10 stocks. So again, you've got the top 10 stocks. Yeah. And then you've got something that's a little bit more opaque. Have you ever bought an option? Some of you might have bought a call option, right? When you buy an option, who do you think sells it to you? Good question, right? Well, there's somebody who creates it and sells it to you. And that somebody is called a market maker. They are the people who look out for the interests of the little guy. Sitto, you know, Saskahana, those kind of guys. Now, they have just sold you an option, which means that they have just made a trade where they're saying the market's going to go down. So, they now have risk. They eliminate that risk by hedging. And how do they hedge? They buy the index. So, it creates more buying pressure, pushes prices higher. It's a trifold mechanical process. Market makers don't care about valuations. They're just managing risk, right? The buyback guys don't care about valuations. They just care about their stock options. And the index funds don't care because they have to buy when money flows into index funds, which happens passively, especially through the pension contribution system. So, it's not about fundamentals anymore. It's about mechanical buying. But when the market turns, these same forces can work in reverse. Right? Index funds have to sell. Buybacks, okay, they're still there. But if companies have less money, they'll buy less. And options hedging will flip to sell. And that's when things turn ugly. Very, very. So, we talked about what makes 2026 a beautiful year. And by the way, I'm very heavily invested right now. I I I'm very very bullish. All of our institutional indicators are very aggressive right now. And again, you want to get potentially access to that in our mentoring, book yourself a free call at vixens.org/freedom. But the party will end. Every party ends, no matter how good it is. It might be at 2:00 in the morning, at 4 in the morning, at 6:00 in the morning. It might continue on the next day. It might last all bloody weekend, but at some point, the hangover is going to get you. The question is, when bad will it be? Well, let's look at what would trigger a market crash and then you will have the five ingredients that you can watch for to know what to do. Now, I think there's a simpler thing to look out. I'll share that with you in a second. But you want to understand the fundamentals first. First, if we get a weakening labor market, you know, unemployment is higher than it's been at any time since 2021. Maybe the data is better, maybe it's not. Don't really care. It doesn't look great. It doesn't look terrible, but it doesn't look great. So, unemployment goes up, people tend to spend less money. When people spend less money, companies make less profits, right? When companies make less profits, they off more workers. You get you get the uh you get the idea, right? It's a vicious little vicious little beast of a circle. But then they are going to lower interest rates. So, you know, we might just be fine. What about the second part? Staglation. What the heck is that? That means your growth is slow with rising unemployment which is what we have at the moment and inflation remains sticky above target. So say inflation remains at wherever it is right now 2.8% or something like that and your GDP growth is neither here nor there. Then what do you do? You can't cut rates because you've got inflation. You can't stimulate the economy because you've got inflation. Right? You get the idea. That's probably the worst case scenario. Stackflation. Government can't spend much more money. They're already spending two trillion extra that they don't have every single year. So that's a risk. Now having a half a trillion dollars flowing into infrastructure spending from AI, that's a lot of money. That could give us some decent economic growth. So maybe this won't happen. Third, we have extreme valuations. And this is where a lot of people are talking about right now, right? The PA ratio of the S&P is 28. historically it was much lower. So say companies earnings their profits start to disappoint. Well that would become a problem. So when video comes out and says we grew at only 30% and we were expecting 60. Ah now stock prices are going to fall. What's going to happen then? People are going to sell their index funds. The index funds have to sell. And when the index funds sell what do they sell? They'll sell the top 10 stocks. Right? So now people panic because everybody owns the top 10 stocks and they sell even more and then index funds have to sell more and then you know you you get the idea. And we've seen this movie before by the way 2000 the S&P hit 30 the PE ratio it then it then dropped by 50%. I don't mean to spoil your holidays but you know it can happen. In 2021 it hit 30 and then dropped 25%. So how do I see 2026 playing out? I think we're gonna get a euphoric half first half of the year. Going to be a big market surge. Everyone's making money. Middle of 2026, maybe a little bit later, maybe just after midterms, pure coincidence. No politics of course involved there. Unemployment might tick higher or be allowed to tick higher because employment data is, you know, whatever you want it to be. earnings guidance might start to get cut a little bit and the inflation might still be there because they're going to cut interest rates and therefore the end of the year or in early 2027 the reality might hit that maybe we just partyed a little bit too hard. Maybe we need to have a lay down. And that isn't a doom and gloom scenario. That's just the cycle of the market, right? The market moves like this. So what do you want to do? Well, two options. You can just stay in the whole thing and enjoy it. Or you can figure out some sort of way where you can take the good bits and you can skip the worst bits. Uh which is what we aim to do by following institutional trading strategies. Again, you want to learn more about that, you know what to do. Book yourself a call, felix.org/freedom. It's a freedom call. It's like um liberation day without the crash. So, let me give you five warning [snorts] signs so that when you see like three or four or five of these flashing red at the same time, it might be time to get defensive. The first three, I want to take notes, is speculation going parabolic. I'm talking meme stock, spaxs, dog themed cryptocurrencies, all the crazy stuff. When people say, \"This time it's different. This, you know, Btcoin will make me a billionaire.\" That's when you might think, \"I think I've seen this movie before.\" And then they're going to go up 100 and 200, 500% in a few weeks. And again, that's a sign. It means, well, the dumb money is the last to move in. That's just the reality. And the dumb money tends to chase pretty dumb stuff. Um, not saying the smart money is any smarter, but it's just the reality really of it. The second is massive gains. So if you think if everyone says, \"Oh, look, I only made 40% last year. Isn't that terrible?\" You know, again, win at the top because people have normalized crazy returns. The market historically has done about 8 to 10%, not 30 or 40 or 50. That's number two. Number three is margin debt. As I'm recording this, there's about $1.2 trillion in margin debt. That's people who have borrowed to buy a stock. Now, don't do that. That's what I'd say to you. Unless you have extraordinarily sophisticated risk management, margin is going to bite you in the backside because when it goes down, it goes down twice as fast and you need to come up with the cash. Otherwise, you're going to have to sell. And guess where? You're going to have to sell. You're going to have to sort of the bottom of the market, the exact point where you actually would like to be buying. But the problem is that with 1.2 trillion in in in in in margin, the market goes down. All those guys have to unwind their margin and 1.2 trillion will disappear from the market very very quickly. The fourth thing is there is a great thing out there, probably the only great thing that CNN has ever done and is called the fear and greed index. Right now it's a it's a scale, right? It's sort of a scale, bit like a car dial type thing. Right now, it's sitting at about 56 as I'm recording this. That's greed. Not extreme greed. It can hit like 80 or 90. But there's also another way to look at it. When your Uber driver is giving you stock picks, everybody at parties is talking about how much money there is in making stocks. When everybody's an expert, the top is near. It's a little harder for me nowadays because people always come to me and talk to me about stocks. So I'm like, are you talking about stocks because the market's overvalued or you talking about stocks because you think I know something about stocks? That's there was a problem for me. Put another way when Winston starts talking about stocks back there. That's really when we were in trouble. The other thing, Brett, I would actually put that in square brackets just because of the nature of the index fund flow. I I would maybe take that out. I think there's some point to it, but I think let's simplify this and take it out. So all of that, by the way, is in the workbook. It's in the free community so you can just download that. So what's the strategy? Like the simplest thing to do is just a dollar cost average into the index. It's just buy V or spy or whatever and and just do it every week, every Monday. You're good or every month or whatever, but more often better. You can't stop. You're never allowed to stop ever, right? Especially in crashes. Um a little bit more sophisticated would be to have some cash reserves on the side and then try to go in when the market crashes. You might also want to start adding some defensive stocks when these things get triggered. Um and and defensive stocks to me would be anything at the moment that is non AI, right? Um hard to find. Well, actually no. There are plenty of companies out there that are not AI related. And I would strongly suggest you eliminate any margin in your broker unless you have some extraordinary riskmanagement signal. Um which I do think we actually have, but most people don't understand it. be very happy to teach it to you, but mostly we don't understand it. And when your meme stock goes up, you know, 100% in three days, don't have to sell it because I always say, don't sell your losers or your winners rather. Um, but at the very least, set a bloody trailing stop so that when this thing goes to, I don't know, 90 or 80% it sells and you lock in the gains because otherwise it's going to go back down. and it'll be at minus 80% before you can say kumbaya, right? So, please, please, please be smart about that. Don't sell your wingers early, but you want to have at least a trailing stop on there. You're going to want to have written rules if you're more of an active investors. And I would strongly recommend you adopt a systematic approach, which is what Wall Street does, which is what we teach. It removes your emotions. that makes you a rulesbased beast, which is what I'm doing at the moment, but I'm doing always, but at the moment I'm running a particular experiment where I'm running a million dollar of my own money following purely the system and it's a Wall Street system and the back testing it's done extraordinarily well, but back tests are imperfect very much so. So, I'm testing it with my own money and you can watch with me, you can learn with me, you can um see the whole thing if you wish. How do you do that? Well, start by booking a free call with us and a chat with my team. See if this is might be the right thing for you. The zero pressure, zero obligation, and go to freelix.org/free. If you got some value out of this video, well, share it with somebody else who might get some value out of this. So not everybody is a you know the problem with the co crash is a lot of people just forgot the lesson right they then just went all in on the meme stocks which was great for a while and then they lost most of that money when it collapsed and that's avoidable you don't have to give the money back street would like you to but it is it is an option it is your option so your option is really for 2026 2027 do I want to um temporarily make money and then hand it all back to Wall Street or do I want to keep the The choice is yours. Winston says, uh, be smart about it. It's lying there behind the under the table. I wish you a glorious start of 2026. May all your dreams come true. May it be the most glorious, splendid, and successful for you. But I think for those things to come true, you need to change what you're doing. Whatever you're doing right now, you need to change it. Otherwise, you're very likely to get the same outcomes. And I appreciate the market's been very good for us the last two or three years, but it won't always do that. And we're going to get a repeat of the co postcoid crash and guaranteed. And you want to be in a better position to act on that and actually make money out of it rather than lose money out of it. There we are. All the best. Felix and Winston here. And if you're worried what your favorite tech stocks are going to do at the end of 2025, in the beginning of 2026, then this is the right video for you. We're going to walk you through."
