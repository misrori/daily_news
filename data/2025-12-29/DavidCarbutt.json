        "transcript": "Aaron Levy is the CEO of Box, a company worth over $3 billion. He just published a post on X that explains why AI won't destroy jobs, but will instead create an explosion of new work. There's a 200-year-old economic paradox. It predicted what happened with coal, with computers, and with the internet. And Libby thinks it predicts exactly what's coming with AI. Let me read you his post. In the 19th century, English economist William Stanley Jevans found that techdriven efficiency improvements in coal use led to increased demand for coal across a range of industries. The paradox of course being that if you assume demand remains constant, then the volume of the underlying resource should fall if you make it more efficient. Instead, making it more efficient leads to massive growth because there are more use cases for the resources than previously contemplated. The paradox has proven itself repeatedly as we've made various aspects of the industrial world more productive or cheaper and especially in technology itself. For instance, in the early years of the mainframe, units were measured in the hundreds and only the world's largest companies could afford them. In the early years of the mini computer, a smaller, cheaper version of the mainframe, units were in the tens of thousands. And in the early days of the PC, units were in the millions. That's a 100fold increase for each new era of computing in just three decades. While you would have to have been a Fortune 500 company to access powerful software to do your accounting in the 1970s, by the 2000s with the cloud, it was available to every barbershop in the world. This happened for CRM systems, communication technology, marketing automation, document management software, and nearly every enterprise software application. The advantages that a large enterprise had in procurement, installation, maintenance, computing capacity, and more simply evaporated overnight because of the cloud. As a result, efficiencies in computing led to the democratization of automation of deterministic work through software for decades in almost every field. But this has never been possible before for the non-deterministic work that represents the vast majority of things we do every day in an enterprise. reviewing contracts, writing code, generating an advertising campaign, doing advanced market research, handling 247 customer support, and thousands of other categories of tasks. AI agents bring democratization to every form of non-deterministic knowledge work, and this will change most things about business. For most large companies today, they can effortlessly move resources around between projects, afford to experiment on new ideas, hire the top lawyers or marketers for any new project they need, contract out or hire engineers to build whatever new initiative they're working on. This has always been an advantage of the world's largest companies, but is a benefit that is only achieved after decades or in some cases centuries of business success and survival. That means for the vast majority of companies and entrepreneurs in the world, you're at an extremely stark disadvantage on day one. No matter what you do, AI agents fundamentally change the calculus here. Now, we can dramatically lower the cost of investment for almost any given task in an organization. The mistake that people make when thinking about ROI is making the R the core variable when the real point of leverage is bringing down the cost of I. Every entrepreneur, business owner, or anyone involved in a budget planning process before knows how scarce resources are when running a business. When you're a small team, you're making decisions between having a good marketing web page, building a new product experience, handling customer support inquiries, taking care of something important in finance, finding new distribution, and so on. Every one of these areas of investment and time are trading off from one another. All of which hold you back from growth. Now we have the ability to blow up the core constraint driving many of these trade-offs. The cost of doing these activities. Rune on X pointed out that any consumer now has better access to education and tutoring than an aristocrat would have had due to AI. And now every business in the world has access to the talent and resources of a Fortune 500 company 10 years ago. demand will go up 10 times or 100 times for many areas of work because we've lowered the other various barriers to entry of doing many more types of work that most companies wouldn't have even experimented with before. Imagine the 10erson services firm that didn't have any custom software before for their business. From a standing start, it may have taken multiple people to develop a full app, keep it running, keep customer requests incorporated, ensure the software stays secure and robust, and so on. The project just doesn't even get started because of this. Now, someone on the team builds a prototype in a few days, proves out the value proposition in a matter of days. You can analogize this to any other type of work or task in an organization. Of course, many are wondering what happens to all the jobs in this new world. The reality is that despite all the tasks that AI lets us automate, it still requires people to pull together the full workflow to produce real value. AI agents require management oversight and substantial context to get the full gains. All of the increases in AI model performance over the past couple of years have resulted in higher quality output from AI, but we're still seeing nothing close to fully autonomous AI that will perfectly implement and maintain what you're looking for. It's clear that AI agents are successfully taking over various tasks that we do today like researching a market, writing code for a new feature, creating digital media for a campaign, but incorporating those tasks into a broader workflow to produce value still requires human judgment and a ton of effort. Even as AI progresses to accomplish more of an entire workflow, we will simply expect more from the work that we're doing, ultimately ensuring that today's jobs are tomorrow's tasks. Historically, this actually happens all the time. If you told someone about Figma or Google Adwords in the 1970s, they'd have expected marketing jobs to plummet since we could do many different jobs inside of a single role in the future. Well, the opposite has happened. Back of the envelope math from AI, of course, suggests that there were a few hundred,000 people employed across marketing related job categories in the 1970s, PR, graphics, advertising, type jobs in the US. Today it's in the low millions. How did we experience a 5x plus increase in these jobs in 50 years at the exact same time that technology made this work far more efficient? Actually, precisely because of those efficiencies. We went from advertising being the domain only of the largest companies, your CPG or car companies to something that almost any small business could participate in. The marketing technology, CRM systems, analytics, graphic design software, targeting platforms, new distribution channels, and many other tech enabled trends allowed more companies to justify the ROI of doing more sophisticated marketing. This will similarly happen in many fields because of AI. Jevon's paradox is coming to knowledge work. By making it far cheaper to take on any type of task that we can possibly imagine, we're ultimately going to be doing far more. The vast majority of AI tokens in the future will be used on things we don't even do today as workers. They will be used on the software projects that wouldn't have been started, the contracts that wouldn't have been reviewed, the medical research that wouldn't have been discovered, and the marketing campaign that wouldn't have been launched otherwise. One of our clients started with zero audience. Now, they're doing $100,000 months thanks to YouTube. And they're not alone. We've helped three businesses hit that level just by growing them a YouTube channel. Want to see how this could work for your business?"
