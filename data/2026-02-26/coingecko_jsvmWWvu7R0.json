    "transcript": "2025  was  shaping  up  to  be  a  defining   year  for  crypto.  It  started  with  major   headlines,  renewed  optimism,  and  a  sense   that  the  industry  was  stabilizing.   Prices  climbed,  sentiment  improved,  and   milestones  followed.   >> Cryptocurrency  crossed  above  the   $125,000  level  for  the  first  time  ever.   >> October  started  strong,  but  quickly  180.   Red  candles  replaced  green  ones,  and   what  was  a  strong  year  ended  up  feeling   far  more  uncertain.  I  mean,  look  at   Bitcoin.  We  went  through  an  entire  year   of  ups  and  [music]  downs  just  for  prices   to  end  the  year  a  little  below  where  we   started.  So,  [music]   is  this  another  normal  crypto  downturn,   or  is  something  deeper  holding  the   market  back?  [music]  Well,  let's  take  a   closer  look.   Crypto  moved  fast  into  2025.  Prices   climbed  early,  and  it  wasn't  all  just   hype.  ETF  inflows  were  steady,   regulation  became  clearer,  and  more  apps   started  showing  early  signs  of  real   revenue.  And  that  shift  also  opened  the   door  for  bigger  players.  After  years  of   uncertainty,  institutions  finally  had   clearer  rules  to  work  with.   >> And  unleashing  America's  digital  asset   potential  with  historic,  transformative   legislation.   >> It  meant  capital  that  had  been  waiting   on  the  sidelines  finally  started  [music]   to  pour  in,  and  the  market  took  notice.   Bitcoin  hit  a  new  all-time  high  of  just   over  $126,000  [music]   on  October  6th,  and  total  crypto  market   cap  briefly  crossed  $4  trillion.  For  a   moment,  it  felt  like  the  market  was   finally  entering  the  expected  euphoric   stage  everyone  was  waiting  for.  And  then   the  tone  changed.  Whether  it's  just   narrative  following  prices,  what  we  know   is  that  the  October  sell-off  was  brutal.   [music]  Trump's  announcement  of  China   tariffs  triggered  a  deleveraging  event   that  wiped  out  $19  billion  of  positions,   [music]  the  largest  in  crypto  history.   Global  uncertainty  rose,  risk  appetite   faded,  gold  continued  skyrocketing,  and   crypto  sold  off  much  more  than   traditional  risk  assets  like  stocks,   which  were  more  resilient.  By  the  end  of   2025,  Bitcoin  was  down  about  30%  from   its  peak  [music]  and  the  total  market   cap  slid  back  toward  3  trillion.  So,  if   last  year  started  so  strong,  what   [music]  went  wrong?  Well,  the  first   thing  to  understand  is  this.  Good  news   alone  isn't  enough.  Many  of  the  rallies   drivers  like  ETFs,  clear  regulation,  and   institutional  participation  weren't   surprises.  By  the  time  that  they  showed   up,  it  was  already  priced  in.  And  that's   because  markets  don't  move  just  on   headlines.  [music]   And  then  after  the  fact,  markets  then   also  adjust  when  reality  turns  out   better  or  worse  than  what  people  were   already  expecting.  And  this  matters  even   more  in  crypto  with  many   cryptocurrencies  like  altcoins.  Prices   often  assume  a  future  where  adoption  is   widespread  and  revenue  growth  is  almost   guaranteed.  But  in  reality,  usage  today   is  still  relatively  small  compared  to   other  technology  sectors.  [music]  So   when  prices  already  reflect  a  bestcase   outcome,  progress  by  itself  doesn't  push   them  higher.  And  when  uncertainty  creeps   in,  even  slightly,  prices  can  fall  fast   because  that  future  suddenly  looks  less   certain.  [music]   But  expectations  weren't  the  only  thing   working  against  crypto.  At  the  same   time,  attention  and  capital  were  being   pulled  somewhere  else.  AI.  [music]   As  AI  took  center  stage,  crypto  wasn't   the  automatic  growth  play  anymore.   capital  that  [music]  might  have  gone   into  crypto  started  flowing  elsewhere.   And  there's  one  more  piece  that  ties   this  together.  Companies  don't  adopt   technology  just  [music]  because  it   sounds  good.  They  adopt  it  when  it  makes   financial  sense.  So,  while  adoption   headlines  kept  coming,  real  usage  and   revenue  didn't  always  follow.  And  as   last  year  came  [music]  to  a  close,  that   gap  became  impossible  to  miss.  So,  the   downturn  wasn't  about  one  thing  going   wrong,  but  a  [music]  stack  of  pressures   hitting  at  the  same  time.  From  the   historic  liquidation  event  in  October,   which  shook  confidence  and  turned   sentiment  around,  to  rising  skepticism   around  the  sustainability  of  AI's  growth   to  rising  geopolitical  tensions,  [music]   which  pushed  investors  away  from   volatile  assets.  Crypto  wasn't  alone,   but  its  volatility  made  the  sell-off   more  intense.  Then  another  source  of   support  started  [music]  to  fade.  Some   companies  that  had  built  large  Bitcoin   positions  saw  their  share  prices  fall.   Raising  new  capital  became  harder  which   slowed  their  ability  to  keep  buying   Bitcoin  and  that  further  took  demand  out   of  the  market.  But  underneath  all  of   that  is  a  deeper  issue.  In  traditional   markets,  companies  are  valued  on   predictable  revenue,  improving  margins,   and  steady  cash  flow.  Prices  rise  when   performance  can  be  measured  and   repeated.  Crypto  still  struggles  with   this.  Much  of  today's  onchain  activity   still  revolves  around  trading  and   speculation.   >> I  I  think  Bitcoin  can  easily  get  to   200,000.   >> Fevenue  rises  in  bull  markets  and  falls   quickly  during  downturns.  So  without   strong  structural  consistent  demand,   growth  depends  [music]  on  narratives.  So   prices  rise  when  new  buyers  show  up.  But   once  the  story  is  priced  in,  momentum   fades.  And  as  crypto  competes  for   capital,  comparisons  to  AI  are  becoming   unavoidable.  Despite  growing  skepticism,   the  AI  sector  is  already  showing   enterprise  demand  and  real  revenue   growth.  While  crypto  is  still  working   toward  that  level  of  economic  clarity,   in  the  end,  the  market  values  real   economic  activity  to  back  up  today's   prices.  Right  now,  most  of  crypto's   value  still  rests  on  expectations  about   the  future  instead  of  consistent  usage   or  revenue.  Now,  don't  get  me  wrong,   progress  is  being  made.  Tokenization   keeps  gaining  [music]  attention  and   major  institutions  are  testing   blockchainbased  settlement  and  custody.   We're  still  in  the  early  stages  of  this.   So  analysts  warned  that  effects  on   earnings  this  year  might  be  limited.  At   the  same  time,  regulation  is  moving   forward,  just  not  evenly.  Some  regions   are  making  real  progress  while  others   are  slow  or  fragmented.  Still,   frameworks  are  slowly  taking  shape.  Even   so,  crypto  has  always  followed  a   familiar  pattern.  Prices  rise,  prices   fall,  sentiment  cools,  and  then  the   market  slowly  rebuilds.  Now,  whether   those  efforts  show  results  in  2026  or   take  longer  is  of  course  still  an  open   question,  but  they're  likely  laying  the   groundwork  for  what  comes  next.  Some   believe  the  next  rebound  could  come   faster  than  before  because  the  ecosystem   is  more  mature  and  infrastructure  is   stronger.  And  on  top  of  that,  we  didn't   see  the  same  type  of  retail   participation  and  market  euphoria  as  the   previous  cycles.  So,  do  you  think  2026   will  be  a  crypto  winter,  or  are  we   headed  for  good  news?  Well,  let  us  know   in  the  comments  below.

A piaci kedv változása mögött a globális bizonytalanság és Trump Kína elleni vámbejelentése állt, ami komoly likvidálási eseményt idézett elő. A hagyományos piaci modellek a kiszámítható bevételekre és növekvő margókra alapoznak, míg a kriptovaluták esetében a kereslet még mindig spekuláción nyugszik. Az AI szektor növekvő népszerűsége miatt a tőke eláramlott a kriptovalutákból, mert a cégeknek a pénzügyi előnyökre figyelnek. Az elkövetkező időszakra a kriptovaluták piaca felnőtté válás jeleit mutatja, de a jövőbeni növekedés mértéke továbbra is kérdéses marad.",
