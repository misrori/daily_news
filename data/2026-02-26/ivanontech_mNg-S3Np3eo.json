    "transcript": "Welcome  to  another  episode.  And  as  you   see  right  now,  Bitcoin  is  pumping.  We  do   see  a  bit  of  a  pump.  We  had  a  low   earlier  this  week  at  62  approximately.   And  now  we're  coming  back  in  a  big  big   big  fat  way  towards  68.  And  as  you  know,   we've  been  discussing  during  the  last   few  days  that  we  may  have  a  repetition   of  something  like  we  had  for  example  in   2014,  which  was  a  midterm  year.  If  you   look  at  the  percent  gain  from  the   beginning  of  the  year,  we're  tracking  it   exactly.  And  as  you  can  see,  it's  a  bit   of  a  pump  here  coming  into  March.  Okay,   so  it's  2014.  Then  if  you  look  at  2018,   which  is  another  midterm  year,  it's  very   similar.  We  had  a  very  similar   development.  2026,  as  you  know,  is  a   midterm  year.  2018  and  2014  are  also   midterm  years,  were  also  midterm  years.   And  we  are  basically  exactly  where  they   were.  And  next  is  a  bit  of  a  pump.  The   same  thing  is  if  we  look  at  2022,  it   also  has  a  bit  of  a  pump  going  into  into   March  and  even  a  bit  later.  But  that's   what  we're  dealing  with  right  now.  We   need  to  see  whether  Bitcoin  can  master   some  kind  of  pump  that  would  be  similar   that  would  be  similar  to  what  we  saw   during  the  last  midterm  years.  And   approximately  uh  half  of  the  dump  is   erased  in  the  upcoming  pump.  What  do  I   mean  by  that?  If  you  look  at  the  average   here  and  you  look  the  the  the  white  one   is  the  average  and  as  you  can  see  the   green  one  the  current  year  is  like  exact   as  the  average  but  we  bottom  out  here  in   the  average  approximately  minus  26%   where  we  are  currently  at  at  the  end  of   February  and  then  on  average  we  pump  all   the  way  to  minus  12%.  For  the  year  so  if   we  look  at  how  it  may  look  like  so  the   year  started  here   uh  and  then  now  and  then  we  went  down   26%.  If  we  are  to  pump  approximately,  so   we're  down  12%,  it  could  even  look   something  like  this.  If  we  go  to  80K,   okay,  of  course,  we  have  a  bit  of   resistance  before  at  74.  That  would  be   the  first  resistance.  But  something  like   that  wouldn't  surprise  us  at  all.  Why?   Because  this  is  basically  this  would  be   a  repetition  of  the  u  of  the  previous   midterm  years.  Some  kind  of  pump  like   that,  then  a  uh  a  lower  high,  a  lower   high,  and  then  going  back  there.   Something  like  this.  Let's  see  how  this   will  evolve.  But  personally,  I'm  seeing   it  more  as  a  a  trap  right  now  because   when  you  look  at  previous  midterm  years,   it's  exact  exact  to  the  day  and  we  are   in  bare  trend.  So  the  path  of  least   resistance  is  down  and  then  you  see  here   is  exact  exact  exact  to  the  day.  Does   have  to  repeat  exact  obviously  nothing   has  to  do  anything.  Uh  the  market  does   not  owe  us  any  any  certainty  but  the   trend  is  down.  The  path  of  least   resistance  is  down  and  likely  we  will   continue  down  like  all  the  other  midterm   years.  As  you  can  see,  it's  a  bit  of  a   pump  in  the  coming  10  days  or  so.  Uh  you   see  here,  and  then  it's  uh  further  down   and  further  down  and  further  down.  So,   yeah,  that's  why  overall  for  the  year,   we're  not  really  changing  anything.  It's   we're  not  really  changing  anything.  Um   we're  just  seeing  that  we  need  some  kind   of  relief.  We  haven't  really  had  any   kind  of  relief.  Maybe  you  can  call  this   as  a  relief  rally,  but  ever  since   October,  we  didn't  really  have  any  kind   of  relief.  So,  can  we  have  it  for  10   days?  It's  very  possible.  I  would  say   it's  uh  very  very  very  very  very  very   possible  especially  when  you  compare  to   how  previous  midterm  years  have   performed  and  we  also  have  a  bit  of a   catalyst  here  with  this  Jane  Street   situation.  The  fact  that  Jane  Street  now   is  uh  is  gone  from  the  market  because   they're  sued.  So  they  need  to  be  more   careful  in  how  they  short  the  crap  out   of  this  market.  Um  maybe  they  they  stop   dumping,  maybe  they  stopped   participating.  And  so  Eric  Balcunas  who   is  ETF  analyst  at  Bloomberg  is  coming   out  saying  that  the  boogeyman  is  gone.   The  vibe  on  crypto  Twitter  is  positive   and  the  price  action  is  showing  it.  Is   eliminating  it  enough?  Is  eliminating   the  boogeyman  enough  for  a  sustained   rebound?  I  guess  we'll  find  out.  My  bet   is  that  it's  going  to  be  very  very  nice   for  10  days  or  so.  Everyone's  going  to   feel  euphoric  because  that's  how  it   feels  in  a  bare  market  when  you're  down   a  lot.  But  then  you  become  down  slightly   less.  You're  down  minus  90%  but  then  you   become  down  minus  85%.  It  feels  amazing.   So  we  may  have  quite  some  euphoria  here   in  the  coming  10  days  guys  if  we  see  the   the  rebound  but  you  know  the  overall   picture  is  still  that  the  magnet  is  to   the  downside.  There's  still  a  big  fat   magnet  here  going  into  the  buy  zone.   Also  what's  interesting  is  that  our   community  has  started  longing  uh  on  the   short  time  frame.  We  do  see  the  longs   now  being  deployed.  We  have  manukas   longing  some  bonk  thing  supervision  but   with  mechanical  rules  with  a  stop-loss   with  position  management  you  can  do   that.  You  have  soul  long  long  and  soul   as  well  but  to  the  upside  fantastic   result.  You  have  banksy  rules  also  long   and  soul.  Oh  actually  I  think  it's  it's   two  trades  he  did  here.  Banks  rules  long   and  soul.  So  as  you  can  see  whatever  the   wave  is  riding  it  whether  it's  short  or   long.  Whatever  the  wave  is  you  can  ride   it.  And  that's  exactly  exactly  what   we're  doing  in  Bulmania.  This   Antonopoulos  saying  uh  another  uh  daily   close  another  daily  trade  on  BGB  and   fantastic  fantastic  u  result  and  this   one  let's  see  it's  short  okay  he  sure  he   did  short  here  another  short  here  from   Rudol  another  short  here  from  pool   cleaner  and  another  long  here  from  uh   animal  so  a  bit  of  a  mixed  long  and   short  but  during  the  last  weeks  or  so   it's  only  been  short  so  now  it's  a  it's   a  bit  of  both  so  as  you  can  see   currently  when  the  market  is  turning  up   for  the  coming  10  days  it  is  the  longing   season.  On  the  shorter  time  frames  it  is   but  on  the  big  time  frame  on  the  big   picture  time  frame  the  story  is  the   same.  Nothing  really  has  changed.  Um  and   even  if  we  go  to  let's  say  80  and  create   a  lower  high  nothing  changes  either  but   the  first  thing  that  Bitcoin  has  to  do   is  to  at  least  touch  okay  at  least  touch   this  resistance  at  74.  This  is  my  first   uh  this  is  my  first  target.  If  we  get  to   74,  I  would  even  close  a  bit  of  longs   because  it  is  a  big  resistance.  It  is   the  bottom  of  the  previous  year.  It's  a   multi-year  resistance  basically.  So,  if   you  are  longing  Bitcoin  to  the  upside,   betting,  speculating  on  the  relief   rally,  um  you  could  take  a  bit  a  bit  of   profit  here.  Uh  why?  Because  in  case  uh   the  resistance  is  in  play,  it  may  get   rejected  and  then  try  again.  So,  uh  this   is  a  good  riskmanagement  um   riskmanagement  area  where  you  can  take   some  chips  off  the  table.  And  of  course,   the  big  question  is  where  to  trade.  If   you  go  to  bullmain.com/partners   or  you  use  the  link  in  the  description,   it  says  exchanges  I  use  and  then  you're   going  to  click  this  link  as  well.   Whatever  you  want,  either  go  to   bull/partners  or  click  the  link  in   description  exchanges  I  use.  Uh  BBIT  is   the  first  choice.  If  you  don't  have   BBIT,  get  by  bit.  I'm  using  it  since   2019.  Very,  very  solid.  You  have   precious  metals,  you  have  stocks,  you   have  cryptos,  you  have  bank  account   coming  soon,  you  have  debit  card,  you   have  everything.  You  have  everything.  So   by  bit  is  the  number  one  choice.  If  for   some  reason  you  cannot  get  by  bit,  maybe   for  geopolitical  reason,  for  residency   reason,  for  whatever  reason,  you  can  go   to  pionx  or  weeks  or  bit  unix.  If  you   have  to  choose  one  for  going  long  or   short,  then  go  to  weeks  because  they're   going  to  have  a  lower  KYC.  And  also  you   get  a  big  fat  signup  bonus  if  you  sign   up  and  deposit.  And  if  you  want  trading   bots,  then  it's  Bionex.  Bionex  has  the   trading  bots.  You  you  also  have  crypto,   precious  metals  and  stocks  and  uh  yeah,   you  can  go  you  can  go  heavy  in  all  of   them  and  you  know  now  it's  bearish  time.   So  harvesting  freebies  is  the  key.  Why?   Because  literally  you  have  so  many   discounts  and  soon  when  Bitcoin  will   bottom  out  later  this  year,  all  of  the   money  you  can  get  needs  to  be  deployed.   We're  going  to  be  covering  that  in  the   coming  quarters.  It's  still  not  yet   time.  Still  not  yet  time.  The  path  of   least  resistance  is  still  down,  but  it's   going  to  change.  I  think  in  the  Q3  Q4  is   going  to  change.  We're  going  to  go  into   bull  trend  and  then  the  path  of  least   resistance  is  going  to  be  up  and  then   every  single  penny  we  can  deploy  at  the   cheap  cheap  levels  within  the  buy  zone   is  fantastic  and  a  lot  of  it  is  going  to   be  life-changing.  A  lot  of  the  money  you   put  in  when  it  is  time  to  be  bullish   which  is  not  now  uh  is  going  to  be   life-changing.  It's  going  to  be   life-changing.  Now  look  here  we  have   more  uh  news  regarding  the  ETH  treasury   companies  guys.  Ezilla,  which  was  or  is   still  a  treasury  company.  Now  they  are   rebranding.  They're  removing  their   treasury  company  status  and  they   collapsed  a  lot.  Like  this  stock  is   fully  destroyed  and  now  they  removed   this  label  treasury  company  and  they   have a  bit  of  a  rebound.  But  it's  it's   another  reason  to  stay  away  stay  away   from  treasury  company.  I  keep  repeating   it.  You  can  read  more  exactly  what   happened  here.  But  uh  yeah,  it's  not  too   good.  Now  they  have  30  13%  pump  after   rebrand  to  foreign  market.  So  it's  not   this  [ __ ]  your  name  anymore.  And  yeah,   I  guess  they're  going  to  do  something   else.  Uh  but  yeah,  it's  been  horrible.   This  treasury  companies,  they've  been  so   so  horrible.  And  for  for  what?  For  no   reason.  For  no  reason.  Because  if  you   want  more  volatility,  you  can  you  can   use  leverage.  You  can  go  to  buy  bit.  You   can  you  can  do  whatever  you  want.  Uh  but   the  last  thing  you  want  is  to  have  a   dude  managing  a  company  where  you  have   your  money  and  there's  very  little   little  oversight.  The  same  thing   happened  with  this  David  Bailey.  What   was  this?  Nakamoto.  Nakamoto.  Read   Nakamoto.  Down  99%  over  it  is.  Um  now  we   have  good  news  for  all  of  you  in   Netherlands.  Guys,  if  you  are  from   Netherlands,  big  shout  out.  Good  news   where  the  Dutch  finance  minister  pled   pledges  that  the  tax  will  not  happen.   He's  gonna  rethink  it.  He's  gonna   rethink  it.  He's  gonna  rethink  the  36%   unrealized  gains  tax.  Okay.  I  guess  he   should  be  happy,  but  it's  only  a   question  of  time  before  they  they   repeat.  The  Netherlands  just  canceled   the  36%  tax  on  unrealized  gains.  Uh  back   to  the  drawing  board  after  huge  negative   public  reaction.  Here's  the  problem,   guys.  Unfortunately,   unfortunately,  this  will  not  help   Netherlands  because  the  damage  is  done.   The  damage  is  done  where  if  you  are   living  in  Netherlands,  you  know  what   they're  thinking.  And  also,  if  you  ever   thought  moving  to  Netherlands,  I  don't   know  why  you  would  do  that.  But  u  uh   let's  say  you  considered  it.  I  think  you   will  never  consider  it  again  after  what   they  tried  to  do  here.  This  is  the   problem  with  socialism  uh  politics  as  a   whole.  Even  if  they  don't  get  the   policies  through,  even  if  they  don't   implement  them,  they  still  hurt  the   country  just  discussing  them.  As  soon  as   a  politician  mentions  exit  tax,  suddenly   a  lot  of  entrepreneurs  move  even  before   it's  even  implemented.  As  soon  as  some   discussion  happens  is  already  being   affected,  the  country  is  being  affected   by  capital  flight.  Okay.  So  the  same   thing  is  here.  I  don't  know  how  many   entrepreneurs  they  lost  just  discussing   it  for  months  and  months  and  months  and   months  and  months.  Uh  probably  a  lot   probably  a  lot  and  uh  again  if  you  ever   thought  moving  to  Netherlands  I  I  don't   understand  why  well  I  understand  if  you   have  no  money  you  want  you  want  benefit   then  I  understand  if  you  have  any  kind   of  productivity  you  have  any  kind  of   revenue  in  your  company  or  your  car   profession  your  career  stay  out  stay  out   they  they  just  showed  what  they  go  for   and  they  go  for  high  tax  high  tax  they   don't  like  you  they  don't  like  people   with  money  they  want  to  take  your  money   and  redistribute  so  anyway  it's  it's   Crazy.  But  uh  good  good  Guzman,  you  can   stay  in  Netherlands  now  a  bit  more.  At   least  something  is  good  that  they  remove   it  at  least  temporarily.  Uh  what  else  we   have?  We  have  this  Sugnum.  So  if  you   want  Swiss  banking  and  you  want  a  bank   in  Switzerland  that  supports  crypto,   Sugnum  is  such  a  bank  and  now  they're   opening  up  more  services  uh  to  handle   strategic  asset  allocation  for  corporate   crypto  treasuries  uh  and  is  already   managing  over  200  million  in  volume.   There  you  go.  There  you  go.  So  some   banks  in  Europe  are  very  good  for  crypto   founders,  for  crypto  entrepreneurs,  for   crypto  traders  and  Signnum  is  one  of   them.  So  yeah,  if  you're  looking,  they   do  have  a  deposit  requirement  though.  So   you  need  to  be  you  need  to  have  some   size.  You  need  to  have  some  size.  But   all  in  all,  it's  one  of  the  one  of  the   options  you  have.  So  you  don't  have  to   use,  you  know,  Revolute  or  Wise  and  then   explain  why  the  hell  do  you  use  uh   crypto  and  what  you're  doing  with  with   your  money.  But  guys,  on  the  big   picture,  that's  basically  it.  We  have  a   day  which  is  sideways.  We  have  a  day   where  it's  a  bit  of  a  rebound.  But  if   you  look  at  the  last  week,  the  last  week   it  was  the  same  price.  The  last  week  was   the  same  pri  and  then  the  week  before   that.  Everything  is  the  same  price.  Like   the  last  uh  um  four  weeks  we're  just   sideways.  We're  just  sideways.  A  bit  of   a  green.  So  that's  good  to  see.  Let's   see  if  bulls  can  hold  it.  If  they  can,   then  I  expect  us  to  go  here  first.  Here   I  would  derisk  a  bit  for  for  the  long   exposure  because  the  rejection  risk  is   high.  Should  we  break  it  then  it   wouldn't  surprise  me  if  we  go  to  here  80   which  would  correspond  to  previous  pumps   in  previous  midterm  years.  Okay.  The   size  of  the  pump  uh  in  previous  midterm   years  h  how  much  we  recover  the  loss  and   then  uh  towards  uh  end  of  March  and   April  um  if  history  repeats  it  will  be   going  down  and  also  with  the  bare  trend   with  a  bare  trend  this  is  the  number  one   scenario  anyway  that's  quickly  check   what's  happening  with  all  sana  sana  sana   sana  it  knows  that  the  final  destination   is  right  here  but  it's  clinging  on   clinging  on  to  its  dear  life.  It  will   not  help  it.  It  will  not  save  it.  We  are   getting  magnetized  down  here.  It's  a   question  of  time.  So  yeah,  the  same   analysis  as  before.  If  most  boring  chart   in  the  world  just  chopping  for  five   years  soon.  I  mean,  isn't  that  crazy,   guys?  It's  chopping.  It's  literally   chopping  for   over  five  years  between  1K  and  5K.  1K   5K.  1K  5K.  1K  5K.  So  anyway,  if  it  gets   to  1K,  probably  a  good  uh  uh  good  level   to  buy.  But  uh  yeah,  you  can  also  think   of  it  as  uh  ascending  triangle.  But  I   don't  like  ascending  triangle  too  much   because  it's  um  it's  uh  this,  you  know,   vertical  sloping  line  and  um  they're   just  less  reliable  than  the  horizontal   line.  Horizontal  line  it's  it's  way   better.  But  you  can  also  think  of  it  as   potentially  ascending  triangle  if  it   gets  a  bounce  here.  Uh  but  but  but  but   my  preference  is  horizontal.  So  let's   see  if  it  can  get  down  here  towards  1K   that  would  be  good  buy.  Um  otherwise  um   it  could  also  be  goodbye.  If  if  it  goes   below  then  it's  goodbye  towards  300  370.   So  guys  either  it  is  a  good  buy  if  it   doesn't  break  below  is  going  to  be  a   good  buy  or  it's  goodbye  guys  towards   370  if  it  if  it  breaks  it.  But  ETH  is   one  of  these  charts  where  it's  just   boring.  You  don't  have  to  trade  it   because  there  is  there's  no  big  fall   really.  The  fault  that  can  happen  here   is  maybe  towards  1K.  But  the  Solana  has   a  more  interesting  fall  towards  30  from   the  chart  perspective.  And  also  there's   no  big  pump.  I  mean  what  can  maybe  it   pumps  to  this  moving  average  then  gets   reject.  So  when  you  have  a  chart  like   this  it's  boring.  It's  sideways.  It's   chopping.  Nothing  is  clear  here.  It  just   chop  sideways.  It  chop  sideways.   Currently  in  bare  trend.  So  maybe  it   goes  to  1K  and  either  it's  a  good  buy  or   a  good  or  it's  good  buy.  Let's  see  if  it   goes  here  to  370.  Of  course,  it's  going   to  be  super  interesting  to  buy  here.  If   it  really  breaks  this  range  to  the   downside,  holy  crap.  Yeah,  then  then   we're  speaking  here.  Still  too  early  to   say  anything  and  it's  one  of  these  more   unlikely  bearish  targets.  Uh  I  think   Sana  going  to  30  is  way  more  likely  than   this  going  anywhere  near  here.  But  yeah,   let's  see  if  it  happens.  We  have  a  plan.   BNB  what  is  doing?  What's  happening?  It   has  a  bit  of  support  here  and  yeah  same   as  weeks  before  avalanche  want  to  go  to   alltime  low  kind  of  like  that.  Let  me   know  what  what  other  coins  you  guys  want   us  to  look  at.  I  have  my  standard  list.   I  check  here.  Uh  yeah  polka  dot  you  see   yourself.   You  see  polka  dot  is  going  to  zero.  It's   price  discovery   alltime  low  broken.  Boop.  Price   discovery.  So  yeah  let's  go  to  Q&A  guys.   questions,  answers,  debates.

And  most  importantly,  you  don't   waste  the  next  cycle.  Don't  waste  if  you   think  that  this  cycle  was  bad  that  you   executed  bad.  Like  for example,  if  you   say  that  there  was  no  old  season  this   cycle,  I  know that  you  executed  bad.  You   are  complaining  that  there  was  no  old   season  because  chain  link  and  dot  and   other  so-called  blue  chip  did  not  pump.   But  there  was  old  season.  Dog  with  hat   went  to  5  billion  fartcoin.  Like  there   was  old  season.  You  were  just  hoping   that  your  alts  would  recover.  They  never   did.  So  I  understand  why  you  think  so.   So  you  need  to  avoid  those  mistakes  in   the  next  cycle.  Go  to  bulling.com,  watch   the  mechanical  rules  free  training  and   then  join  to  get  the  money  line,  the   money  scanner.  Every  all  information  is   in  that  video,  guys.  Let's  go.  Let's  go.   Let's  go.  Ivan,  is  this  a  dead  cat   bounce?  Well,  it's  kind  of  what  we  just   discussed  this  whole  video,  but  uh  uh   most  likely  yes.  Most  likely  yes.  Uh   looking  at  uh  the  previous  midterm   years,  looking  at  all  of  the  resistance   that  Bitcoin  has  to  clear  and  um  it's  a   lot,  man.  You  just  you  see  yourself,   it's  this  resistance  here,  then  it's   this  resistance  here,  then  and  then  it's   bull  flip.  I  mean  if  if  it's  maybe  then   it  just  flips  bullish  going  to  a  new   bull  market.  Uh  but  it's  it's  still  a   lot.  It  needs  to  clean  a  lot  a  lot  a  lot   of  resistance  and  uh  yeah  it's  also  very   common  for  it  to  pump  into  the  midterm   year  in  March  here  this  this  area  here   that  I'm  showing.  Okay.  So  yeah  likely   but  at  the  same  time  we're  not  cornered   in.  If  we  see  that  okay  now  it's  bull   trend  or  it's  super  strong  we're  going   to  change  the  mind.  That's  the  best.  I   mean,  when  when  you  have  mechanical   rules,  you  you're  adapting.  Just  like   yesterday,  our  community  was  shorting   the  crap  out  of  the  market.  Now,  I  see   people  longing  uh  the  the  the  [ __ ]   course,  the  [ __ ]  Lana  long,  this   bonk  long,  um  another  long.  So,  if  it  is   the  case  that  the  trend  shifts,  going  to   shift,  that's  the  best  part  of   mechanical  rules  of  bull  mania  approach   because  you're  not  cornered  in.  But   yeah,  I  mean  to  answer  your  question,   most  likely  it  is  a  dead  cut  bounce.   There  wasn't  an  old  season  just  random   memecoin  gambling.  Well,  I  mean  that's   what  uh  people  would  tell  you  if  you   bought  the  chain  link  or  you  know  ADA  or   something  back  in  the  day.  The  Bitcoin   maxis  would  tell  you  that  it's  uh  alcoin   gambling.  Okay.  And  now  you  feel  that   you're,  you  know,  this  super  quality   coins  that  they  are  holy.  And  then  all   of  these  [ __ ]  you  know,  memecoins,   you  look  down  at  them.  You  spit  on  them   just  like  Bitcoiners,  even  Litecoiners   spit  on  ETH  and  all  of  the  alts.  Now   you're  you're  you're  with  your  [ __ ]   that  don't  pump  and  you  spit  on  the  dog   with  hat.  Okay.  But  in  reality,  when  you   look  at  the  performance  of  Pepe,  dog   with  hat,  you  compare  it  to  like  DOT  or   chain  link  or  whatever,  it's  it's  better   performance.  It  was  it  was  better  the   cycle.  So  your  fundamentals  will  not   save  you.  You're  probably  in  the   fundamentals  trap  or  in  the  diamond  hand   trap.  Um,  as  you  know,  we  are  releasing   a  book  soon  about  trading.  Uh,  it's  it's   going  to  be  such  a  fantastic  book  for   everyone  to  reset  their  brain.  If  I  hear   someone  say  that  there  was  no  old   season,  I'm  going  to  be  shipping  you  the   book  because  your  brain  is   reprogramming.  Very  important.  So  yeah,   I  mean  to  put  it  blunt  to  you,  this  is   where  you  held  you  hope  but  you  do  not   have  a  plan.  You  do  not  have  exit   strategy.  You  no  stop  loss  no  anything.   So  yeah,  that's  why  we  are  we're  seeing   many  people  now  suffering.  But  it's   okay.  It's  okay.  You  learn.  I  I've  been   there  as  well  in  the  past.  Actually,  the   book  starts  where  I  discuss  my  losses.   You're  gonna  if  you  buy  the  book,  you're   going  to  read  in  the  in  the  first   chapter,  I  discuss  my  biggest  loss,  how   I  ended  up  there,  uh  and  uh  what  made  me   really  discover  the  mechanical  rules   because  it  all  started  also  with  big   losses.  Okay,  I  entered  crypto  very   naively  in  2013  as  a  tech  guy.  I  thought   as  a  programmer  I  would  know  everything,   you  know,  I  know  the  tech.  Turns  out,   man,  tech  is  not  that  important.  Dog   with  hat  no  tech.  Pepper  also  had  no   tech.   Yeah,  that's  that.   So,  basically  there  was  an  old  season  as   there  were  many  alternative  coins  tokens   that  pumped.  Yeah,  each  cycle  there  is   an  old  season.  But  the  thing  is  old   season  cannot  pump  all  of  the  coins  from   all  previous  old  seasons.  I  think  that's   what  people  expect.  They  have  a  coin,   it's  down  a  lot  and  then  they  wait  for   the  next  bull  market  and  they  think  that   the  next  bull  market  is  going  to  pump   their  coin.  But  that's  mathematically   impossible  because  each  and  every  cycle   there  are  million  new  coins  and  uh  how   can  you  have  each  bull  market  pumping   all  of  the  previous  coins  and  all  of  the   new  coins?  It's  impossible.  So  always  in   a  new  bull  market  you're  going  to  have   those  coins  that  either  are  have   something  special  which  is  very  low   probability.  Uh  I  mean  one  example  is   let's  say  ETH  but  even  it  didn't  even  go   to  big  alltime  high.  It  just  touched   alltime  high.  What  did  like  a  big  all   time?  Oh  BNB.  Okay.  BNB  probably  the   only  example  where  it  went  and  it   actually  did  a  big  alltime  high  this   cycle.  Okay.  Uh  I  know  all  ETH  maxes  say   that  BNB  is  bad.  It's  centralized.  It's   easy  and  it  is  way  better.  But  if  you   actually  look  at  the  scoreboard  because   we  have  a  scoreboard  guys  is  the  is  the   chart.  If  you  remove  all  of  the   narrative,  if  you  remove  all  of  the   emotion,  you  look  at  the  scoreboard.   This  is  BNB  chart.  Okay.  It  did  a  high   here  at  700  in  2021  and  then  it  did  a   high  here  at  1.3K  in  2025.  So  it   basically  doubled.  It  basically  doubled.   Okay,  that's  the  scoreboard.  You  look  at   ETH,  the  scoreboard  is  not  that  great   because  it  did  a  high  here  and  then  it   never  it  did  like  this  fake  high  like   you  know  few  hundred  dollars  fake  high.   I  don't  know if  you  even  call  it  a  high   but  yeah  it  was  technically  a  high  but   this  is  very  bad  in  comparison  to  BNB.   This  is  very  bad.  You  look  at  um   um  Link,  what  happens  to  Link?  Not  too   much.  All  of  the  announcement,  all  of   the  Swift  collaboration  instead,  what   did  we  get?  Nothing.  Fugazi.  We  got   Fugazi.  Big  fat  Fugazi.  And  oh,  by  the   way,  guys,  just  as  a  reminder,  if  it   breaks  this,  you  have  a  nice  short  here   of  uh  40%.  If  if  it  would  break  it.   Okay.  So,  yeah,  keep  it  in  mind.  Uh,  too   early  yet  to  short.  We  We  need  a  nice   close  below,  I  would  say,  weekly.  But  if   it  closes  weekly  below,  you  can  short   with  mechanical  rules,  with  stop  loss   and  so  on.  What  else,  guys?  Did  the   all-time  high  like  BNB.  I'm  just  trying   to  uh  explain  to  you  the  the  fact  that   most  coins  actually  don't  do  alltime   high  in  the  next  cycle.  Most  don't.  I   mean,  look  at  any  of  them.  Ada,  did  Ada   do  all  high?  No.   Which  else?  Which  else?  Which  else?   Adam  did  not  do  didn't  even  come  close.   So  if  you  have  a  coin  that's  down,   that's  why  I'm  telling  you  likely  it   will  not  come  back.  If  ETH  barely  came   back,  ADA  did  not  come  back.  A  lot  of   other  coins  never  come  back  and  you're   thinking  that  your  coin  that's  XRP  did   alltime  high,  right?  I  mean  it  is   interesting  with  that.  Oh,  and  also  need   to  check  Tron.  All  of  these  coins  people   are  saying  are  scam.  Actually,  they   Yeah,  exactly.  Look  here.  XRP   uh  which  is  the  big  short  here.  XRP   actually  did  go  to  new  high  from  the   2021  days  here.  2017  has  had  some  crazy   crazy  crazy  pump.  It  barely  did  it.  But   that's  one  example.  Let  me  check.  Tron   is  the  scam  coins  that  do  the  best   performance.  I  mean  so-called  scram  scam   coins.  That's  why  we  say  uh  respect  the   pump  because  if  you  think  that  scam   coins  are  pumping,  they're  not  worthy  of   pump.  You  are  rejecting  the  pump  from   your  life.  Let's  see.  It's  stone.  I  need   Tron.   Uh,  where's  the  biggest  short?  Maybe   Binance.  No,  this   uh  definitely  not  this.  Let's  see.  USD.   Where's  the  biggest  chart   crypto?  Crypto.  Nah.  What  is  it?  O  Troy,   man.  What  is  this  crap?  Tron.  Tron.  I   want  Tron.  What's  happening?  Tron  coin.   Exactly.  Tro,  what  is  trade  nation?   Where  is  crypto  here?  TRX.  Oh,  sorry.   TRX  TRX  here.  There.  There  you  go.  There   we  go.  Okay.  Yeah.  See,  man.  Tron  also   alltime  high.  Big  fat  alltime  high.  You   remember  the  song  respect  the  pump.  This   the  saying  I  said  if  you're  mad  that  the   scam  coins  are  pumping  again,  you're  not   respecting  the  pump.  You're  rejecting   the  pump  from  your  life.  And  look  at  the   irony  here.  XRP  and  Tron  and  BNB.  Tron   and  BNB  so-called  Chinese  scam  coins.   They're  the  only  ones  that  did  the   proper  cycle.  Do  you  think  Trump  guys   are  complaining  that  there  was  no  old   season?  Do  you  think  they're   complaining?   Honestly,  do  you  think  they're   complaining?  No.   They  are  eating  there  with  a  chopstick.   Chop  chop  I'm  all  of  the  sushes  and   they're  very  very  happy.   So  Tron,  I  don't  think  they  they   complain.  BNB,  they  are  eating  bow  buns   with  a  chopstick.  Do  they  complain?  Man,   they  don't  complain.  It's  many  bow  band.   Premium  premium  premium  bow  band   ordering  for  the  BNB  guys.   Okay.  Okay.  Uh  so  that's  that.  That's   that  guys.   XMR.  XMR.  See,  this  is  why  when  people   ask  me,  Ivan,  which  coin  do  you  think  is   going  to  pump  next  cycle?  I  had  a  guy   ask  me  that  in  our  Discord   uh  yesterday.  So,  let's  see.  Monero  did   also  Yeah,  Monero  did  quite  nice,  but   you  had  so  little  time  here.  Yeah,  it's   it's  a  bit  low  quality  because  the  other   ones  like  Tron  and  BNB,  they  actually   held  there  for  months  at  the  peak.  Here   it  was  like  a  day  on  the  back.  But,  uh   this  is  why  I  don't  like  predicting  any   kind  of  coin  that's  going  to  pump.  I  had   a  guy  ask  me  yesterday  in  our  paid  the   Discord,  which  coin  do  you  think  is   going  to  be  big  next  cycle?  And  you   know,  people  always  want  to  hear  which   coin,  which  coin,  which  coin.  I  I  told   him  clearly,   I  don't  know.  Also,  I  don't  care  because   that's  the  worst  mistake  you  can  do   trying  to  predict  the  next  cycle  coin.   It  can  be  the  most  random  retardio  thing   such  as  dog  with  hat  or  fartcoin.  And  so   for  us  to  sit  here  and  try  to  predict   based  on  what?  Like  what  do  you  base  it   off?  Fundamentals.  You  based  on   fundamentals.  Okay,  that's  the  dumbest   thing  I've  ever  heard.  It's  the  most   dumb  thing  I  ever  heard.  Why?  because  I   actually  have  in  my  book   about  the  fundamentals.  Here's  the   problem.  Right  before,  so  as  you  know,   we're  releasing  the  book  soon,  but  right   before  2008  collapse,  there  was  an   interview  with  George  Bush  where  a   financial  advisor,  some  guy  who  was   financial  adviser,  he  asked,  \"Hey,  what   do  you  think  the  stock  market  is  going   to  do  in  2008?\"  Okay,  someone  asked   George  Bush.  And  then  George  Bush,  I   mean  to  his  credit,  he  said,  uh,  yeah,   listen,  uh,  don't  really  listen  to  me,   but  he  said,  if  I  would  be  an  investor,   if  I  would  be  an  investor,  I  would  look   at  the  fundamental,  the  fundamentals,   the  fundamentals  of  this  nation  are   strong.  One  of  the  strongest   developments  has  been  the  role  of  the   exporters  in  overall  GDP  growth.  When   you  open  up  markets  for  goods  and   services,  uh,  it's  great.  Like,  it's   strong.  It's  strong.  But  then  he  also   said,  listen,  don't  listen  to  me.  I'm  a   freaking  not  not  a  stock  trader  but  this   is  an  example  where  if  I  were  an   investor  I  would  be  looking  at  the   fundamentals.  So  you  know  when  people   ask  me  Ivan  which  coin  you  think  is   going  to  pump  it's  a  very  bad  question   when  you  ask  it  obviously  I  know  that   you're  not  part  of  uh  really  Bulmania   although  the  guy  was  big  shout  out  but   you  need  to  watch  the  the  training  like   you  need  to  watch  you  need  to  come  to   Bulman  go  to  bull  and  watch  the  video   training  fully  because  it's  one  of  the   things  where  any  kind  of  random  retors   your  thing  can  pump  a  lot  man  can  pump   so  so  much  and  our  job  is  to  not  to  be   judgmental  you  know  that  some  coin  is   below  us  we're  you  You  think  you're  here   and  you  think  all  the  Chinese  scam  is   there  somewhere  is  for  retardos.  But   you're  smart.  You  have  chain  link.  And   all  of  these  dumb  ones,  they  have  Tron   and  BNB,  but  you're  smart  because  you   listen  to  the  bankless  guys  and  they   tell  you  that  Tron  and  and  and  BNB  is   bad.  And  then  they  shield  OP  and  all  of   these  arbitum  and  other  L2  Fugazi.  So   you  think  that  you're  intellectually   above  everyone  else.  You  think  that   you're,  you  know,  you're  you're  in  the   elite  elite   uh  cohort  and  everyone  else  has  a  bit   low  IQ.  What  happens?  I  mean,  you  see   yourself.   You  just  got  to  follow  the  trend,  man.   You  got  to  follow  the  trend.  That's  it.   That's  it.  That's  it.   Eite,  you  think  you're  Eth.  Exactly.  You   think  you're  in  the  you're  the  smug  smug   eth  guy  spitting  on  everyone  and  then   Chinese  bum  bum  bum  bum  bum  they  come   and  they  outrun  you  bigly  bigly  bigly   bigly   L2  equal  two  problems  yeah  that's  true   that's  true  actually  that's  true  also  I   think  Vitalik  said  something  that  he's   redefining  defile   let  me  let  me  actually  check  that  uh  I   yesterday.  It's  yesterday.  I  want  to  see   what  it  is.   See,  man.  Maybe  it  wasn't  Vitali.  Maybe   it  was  ETH  foundation.  They  were  like   redefining  what  they  see  as  DeFi.   Ethereum  Foundation.  Defi.  Let  me  see  if   I  can   They  began  staking.  Ah,  there  you  go.   There  you  go.  They  want  to  start   staking.  So,  that's  good.  Treasure  now   productive.  Yeah.  I  mean,  it  took  them   10  years  to  understand  that  they  can   stake  and  earn  yield.  That's  good.  Or  I   guess  they  didn't  want  to  stake.  So   they're  not  uh  they're  not  choosing  the   winner  or  something.   Oh  yeah,  here  here.  Defi  is  essential   part  of  ETH  value.  Defi  to  today  makes   world's  best  savings,  risk  management,   and  wealth  building  opportunities.   That's  true.  Um  look  here.  But  also  the   as  the  Ethereum  Foundation,  we're  not   interested  in  supporting  onchain  finance   or  even  DeFi  indiscriminately.   Indiscriminately,   how  do  you  say  that?  Discriminate.   Indiscriminately   indiscriminately.   Uh  some  some  Dolingo  guys,  you  get  both   English  Dolingo  and  crypto.  We  have  a   specific  vision  of  what  we  want  to  see   out  of  DeFi,  permissionless,  open   source.  So  I  I  I  love  that  Vitalik   finally  has  some  balls  to  say  what  he   wants  because  before  he  was  like,  \"Oh   no,  I  don't  want  to  say  anything.  I   don't  I  want  the  people  to  figure  it   out.\"  And  then  you  have  a  bunch  of   scammers  do  scam  stuff  or  a  bunch  of  L2s   happen  and  they  just  drain  ETH  users  and   fees  and  everything.  But  now  he's   saying,  \"Listen,  you  got  to  be   permissionless.  You  got  to  be  open   source  private  sec  security  first  global   finance  that  maximizes  people's  control   over  their  own  assets.\"  That's  very   nice.  I  think  that's  fantastic.  Very   good.  Uh  so  yeah,  this  is  what  the   supporting.  We  want  protocols  that  pass   the  walk  away  test  that  keep  working   even  if  the  original  team  suddenly   disappears.  There  you  go.  So  Vitalik  is   pushing  pushing  pushing  for  true  DeFi.   There  we  go.   When  I  saw  Vitalic  dance,  I  knew  I  would   never  be  able  to  buy.  Listen,  if  it  is   in  bull  trend  and  it  has  strong  momentum   and  if  by  the  way  if  may  enter  that   strong  momentum  at  some  point  I  mean  you   see  it's  just  now  rangebound  but  would   it  exit  the  range  properly  here  to  the   upside  it  could  have  insane  price   discovery  I  mean  we  want  something  like   this  you  look  here  want  something  like   this  so  uh  I  don't  want  to  you  know  hate   on  ETH  because   you  know  because  of  whatever  reason   although  it  has  been  a  bit  slow   performing   Um  because  if  it  enters  a  big  fat  bull   trend,  we're  going  to  be  bullish.  Like   we  we're  we're  just  like  he  is   indiscriminately.  We're  we're  also,  you   know,  we  are  indiscriminately.  Okay.   Well,  he's  not.  He  said  he's  not   indiscriminately.  We're  when  it  comes  to   assets,  guys,  we're  not  we  are   indiscriminately.  He's  not   indiscriminately  to  DeFi  projects.  You   got  to  be  decentralized.  But  we  we  are   indiscriminately  towards  assets  that  are   in  bull  trend.  Okay,  that's  very   important.   You  should  only  copy  trade  Nancy  Pelosi.   No  need.   Exactly.  Exactly.  If  you  can  copy  paste   Nancy  Pelosi,  you  have  the  pool  trading   system.  Um,  so  yeah,  there  you  go.   ranges  don't  matter.  The  big  boys  enter   the  chat  and  you  have  a  hex  logo.  So,   anything  you  say  I'm  I  put  kind  of  in   the  trash  can  like  based  on  your  just   historic  performance.  When  it  comes  to   Marcus,  maybe  you're  a  great  person,  but   when  it  comes  to  Marcus,  you're  you're   not  the  best  one  to  ask.  is,  you  know,   it's  like  asking  someone  with  uh  obesity   for  for  training  advice  or  something,   you  know,  for  for  weight  loss.  Now,  you   I  I'm  sure  you're  great  at  other  things.   And  if  you  want  to  be  taken  more   seriously,  you  should  like  rebrand  a  bit   because,  you  know,  just  based  on   performance,   it's  natural,  man.  It's  natural.  Let's   say  you  have  someone  who  is  um  who  who   cannot  draw,  like  he's  very  bad  at   drawing,  and  then  he  teaches  you  how  to   draw.  I  mean,  of  course,  I  don't  want   that.  I  want  someone  who  knows  how  to   draw.  Uh  let's  say  you  have  someone   who  Yeah.  who  just  crashed  his  car  five   times  and  then  he's  your  driver's   teacher,  driving  teacher.  Uh  it's  not   good.  It's  not  good.  I  mean,  at least  he   should  repair  the  car  so  you  don't  see   that  he  crashed  five  times.  If  you  got   destroyed  in  your  portfolio  bigly  during   the  last  year,  two  years,  even  last   three  months,  last  even  last  three   months,  you  know,  we've  been  saying  this   pulse  chain  for  guys  for  quite  some  time   now.  And  uh  let  me  just  show  you   something  here  where,  you  know,  it's   just  last  few  months,  man.  30  days  down   31%.   Uh  how  can  it  be  down  so  much,  guys?  I   remember  on  New  Year's  Eve,  it  it  did  a   new  alltime  low.  And  since  then  it  has   dropped  like  another  30  40%.  Like  you   know  this  is  this  is  not  even  this  is   not  even  this  like  end  of  January  man.   This  is  end  of  January.   It  did  alltime  low  3  days  ago  man.   Great.  Anyway  anyway  listen  we've  left   it.  We've  left  it.  We've  left  it.  You   guys  do  you  you  are  on  your  own.  Good   luck.  Um  I  I  have  no  joy  in  um  repeating   just  know  when  someone  starts  speaking   about  markets  markets  and  you  see  that   they  are  from  pulse  or  hex  you're  like   what  are  you  speaking  what  are  you   speaking  uh  now  maybe  you're  good  at   something  else  maybe  you're  great   gardener  I  would  listen  to  your   gardening  advice  if  you  can  show  a  nice   garden  maybe  you're  great  at  uh   something  else  so  you  can  have  many   talents  and  that's  okay  that's  okay   to  be  fair  I  mean  if  I  would  be  your   English  teacher  maybe  you  would  say  I'm   an  learn  yourself  first  so  it's  kind  of   the  same  kind  of  same  so  it's  not  an   attack  people  always  say  oh  I'm  an   attack  it's  not  an  attack  it's  just  how   the  world  work  it  works  I'm  good  at   making  eggs  exactly  so  if  you  can  teach   that   tell  us  again  the  date  you  told  us  to  do   risk  October  8th  never  forget  it   uh  RH  holds  ETH  better  than  the  founder.   Well,  I  guess  he  bought  the  top.  I  think   he  blasted  the  absolute  ETH  top  and  when   you  buy  the  top,  normally  you're   paralyzed.  Okay,  it's  it's  very  common.   It's  a  very  common  noob  trader  mistake.   You  blast  the  top  and  then  it  starts   dumping  and  you  don't  know  what  to  do.   So,  you're  like  you're  like  dear  in  the   hell   goes  down.  So,  I  totally  understand  why   why  uh  RH  huddles.  Okay,  I  see  it  all   the  time.  People  that  enter  our   community,  they  buy  a  losing  position.   Instead  of  cutting  the  loss  short,  they   huddle  long  time.  When  they  hodddle,   they  can  huddle  minus  90%.  They  huddle,   they  huddle.  And  we  actually  have  it  in   the  book.  I  have  it  in  the  book  also.   Let  me  actually  uh   this  also  a  very  common  it's  a  very   common  mistake.   Let  me  see.  Bird  here,  here,  here,  here,   here.  This  is  a  quote  from  Charles   Faulner.  You  can  Google  who  that  is.  But   anyway,  the  first  rule  of  trading  is  to   cut  your  losses  and  let  your  profits   run.  And  this  is  exactly  what  the  plebe   doesn't  do.  He's  he's  vice  versa.  He   hodddles  the  loss  and  then  he  cuts  his   winner.  And  so  the  the  guy  continues  and   then  that's  the  hardest  thing  to  do.   Seldom  do  any  of  them  wonder  why.  And   yet  this  is  exactly  where  the  efficient   market  theory  breaks  down.  And  the   psychological  nature  of  the  markets   shows  through.  When  we  lose  or  misplace   something,  we  expect  it  to  we  expect  to   find  it  later.  So  basically  when  you   have  a  loss,  you  have  a  loss,  you  expect   that  it's  going  to  come  back.  That's   like  the  default  thinking  of  a  person.   You  lost  something,  you  expect  a  maybe   it's  going to  come  back.  The  cat  comes   back.  Your  cat  bar  run  away.  He  come   back.  We  find  we  find  our  car  keys.   Okay.  But  the  thing  is  you  have  a  losing   position.  It's  not  the  same.  But  your   brain  thinks  that  your  losing  pal's   position  is  your  cat  Barik.  But  it's  not   the  same.   But  did  Barc  come  back   now?  But  we  know  a  dollar  on  the  street   will  not  be  there  the  next  person  pass.   So  this  is  where  again  if  you  see  a   dollar  on  the  street  you  take  it  just   like  when  you  see  a  bit  of  a  gain  in   your  portfolio  you  take  you  you  close  it   as  soon  as  possible.  So  basically  you   hold  the  loser  and  then  you  sell  the   winner.  So  experience  teaches  us  that   losses  are  unlikely  and  gains  are  hard.   A  bird  in  the  hand  is  worth  two  in  the   bush.  Okay.  So  that's  why  you  cut  your   winner  very  quick  then  you  huddle  the   loss.  This  is  when  I  tell  them  that  they   earn  their  trading  profits  by  doing  the   hard  thing  by  going  against  the  human   nature.  This  is  where  the  discipline   comes  comes  in  yada  yada  yada.  Okay  man.   This  book  I  think  is  going  to  change   lives.  It's  going  to  be  there  next  to   Bible  basically.  I  mean  for  for  trading   is  is  going  to  change  lives  man.  It's   going  to  be  insane.  It's  gonna  be   insane.  It's  trading  bible  maybe  because   yeah  I  see  it  over  and  over  again.  So   that  would  explain  why  he  hodddles.  It   would  it  would  it  would  explain   you  you  can  also  call  it  sun  cost.   Exactly.  You  can  call  it  sun  cost.  Uh   but  yeah  you  blast  the  top  you  huddle.   Very  common.  Very  very  I  see  it  all  all.   I  mean  when  should  we  expect  next  old   season?  We're  going  to  see  the  first   signs  of  it  when  Bitcoin  enters  bull   trend  on  the  money  line.  Uh  we  don't   have  to  recover  Bitcoin  price.  You  just   have  to  go  into  bull  trend  on  the  money   line.  I  mean  kind  of  here  you  see  we   went  uh  into  bull  trend.  Bitcoin  price   was  22k  back  in  2023  and  obviously  here   there  were  first  you  know  memes.  I  think   it  was  here  right  the  peps  and  all  of   that.  So  the  price  doesn't  have  to  come   back  all  the  time.  It  just  has  to  enter   bull  trend  on  bitcoin.  That's  when  you   you're  going  to  see  the  first  you  know   new  interest  in  in  uh  coins.   I've  lost  the  most  money  by  selling.   Selling  what?  Selling  losers  or  selling   winners?   Because  you  cannot  lose  too  much  money   if  you  cut  the  small  mistakes  and  never   let  them  turn  into  big  disaster.  Because   at  the  end  of the  day,  it's  not  even  how   much  how  many  times  you  lose.  It's  how   much  you  lose  when  you  lose  and  how  much   you  gain  when  you  gain.  You  want  to   ensure  that  you  cut  the  losses  when   they're  small  mistakes  before  they  turn   into  big  disasters.  Oh,  also  guys,   speaking  about  losses,  in  the  book,  we   have  a  very  important  uh  um  let  me  see   if  I  can   where  is  it?  Stop.  See,  it's  when  I   discuss  the  stop  loss.   It  tells  you  how  much  you  have  to.   Let's  see.  It's  exit.   One  second.  Let  me  find  it  because  this   is  very  important  from  a  risk   perspective.  And  do  you  understand?   Yeah.  Yeah.  Stay  with  me  here.  Here.   Here.   So  when  we  discuss  the  importance  of   stop-loss  and  importance  of  not  allowing   big  small  mistakes  turn  into  big   disasters  is  because  you  need  to   understand  how  much  you  have  to  gain   when  you  lose.  So  let's  say  you  lose  5%.   You  need  to  gain  5.3  back.  So  it's  not   that  bad.  I  mean  you  you  basically  lost   five  and  then  you  need  to  get  back  five.   It's  okay.  It's  okay.  Uh  you  lose  30%   you  have  to  get  back  42.  Here  is  where   it  starts  to  become  a  bit  uh  yeah  a  bit   tougher  but  still  okay  although  you  you   don't  want  to  be  in  this  position  you   ideally  want  to  you  want  to  cap  it   somewhere  here.  Okay  you  want  to  cap  it   somewhere  here  and  then  based  on  your   risk  you  can  create  the  position  size   and  have  a  stop  loss  that  makes  sense   given  the  volatility  of  the  asset.  I   mean  we  this  is  what  the  bullman  is  for   really  but  the  key  is  to  see  here  if  you   lose  80%  you  need  to  get  400%  pump  to   recover  it.  If  you  lose  90%  which  many   coins  have  lost  have  lost  I  mean  many   coins  are  minus  90%  guys  okay  uh  many   coins  you  need  to  gain  back  900  and   that's  like  a  miracle   okay  it's  like  a  you  need  a  miracle  it's   not  it's  not  even  a  trade  it's  a  miracle   okay  like  right  here  a  9%  loss  means  you   need  900  gain  to  recover  that's  not  a   trade  that's  a  miracle  okay  and  why  is   it  hard  to  recover  such  a  loss  because   you  see  new  traders  come  in  at  the  lows   and  they  have  big  profits  way  before  you   are  break  even.  So  they  take  profit  on   your  on  your  ass.  Can  I  say  that  like   that?  Uh  a  bit  of  uh  profanity,  but  they   take  profit  on  your  ass.   Okay.  And  you're  trying  to  make  it  back.   It  can  happen.  I  mean  Sana  did  recover   after  90%  plus  all  last  cycle.  But  it's   an  exception,  not  a  rule,  okay?  It's  a   very  very  big  exception.  Can  happen.  But   you  don't  want  to  be  basing  your   financial  life  on.   Okay,  you  understand?  You  don't.  Okay,   you  if  you  don't,  you're  going  to  learn   the  hard  way.  Okay,   so  yeah,  all  season  we  discussed  this.   discussed.   Do  you  think  we  get  above  PMI  50  for   February?  I  think  it  will  actually   PMI.  I  don't  I  don't  like  macro  too   much,  guys.  I  don't  like  you  follow   macro.   What  is  it  now?   ISM.  We  have  ISM  on  our  website.   PMI.  Let's  see  guys  if  you  hope  that  PMI   will  recover  your  portfolio  for   uh   what's  that  secret?  Let  me  check   trading  view  PM.   But  then  we  also  like  I'm  going  to  show   you  in  the  book  the  macro.   I  mean  I  I  guess  you  just  want  the  ISM   because  ISM  measures  PMI.  Okay.  Like   another  measurement.  I  guess  it's  the   same.   It's  similar.   So,  ISM  already  or  or  no  wait,  did  they   already  move  the  gold  post?  Because  I   remember  everyone  was  saying  that  bull   market  never  happens  when  ISM  is  below   50.  Well,  now  it's  above  50  and  now  did   they  switch  to  speaking  about  the  PMI?   No  way.  Did  guys  confirm  all  of  you   macro  guys?  Did  they  move  the  goalpost?   Because  the  goalpost  before  was  that  ISM   needs  to  get  above  50.  Well,  it  is  above   50.  They  moved  the  goalpost  from  the   global  M2.  Then  global  M2  didn't   correlate  anymore.  They  said,  \"Okay,  no   longer  works.\"  ISM.  ISM  needs  to  go   above  50.  Okay.  ISM  went  above  50.  Bull   market  didn't  come  back.  Okay.  Is  PMI   the  new  thing.   See,  this  is  man,  this  book  is  I  I  feel   I  I  need  to  like  travel  the  world   evangelizing  the  book  here  because  holy   crap.  The  macro  trap.  The  macro  trap.   Another  way  people  get  wrecked  is   through  the  micros.  They  follow  the  ISM   metric  size  of the  business  cycle,  track   interest  rate.  They  build  elaborate   theories  about  how  economy  works  and   what  it  means  for  the  asset  prices.  It   sounds  sophisticated.  It  makes  you  feel   like  you're  doing  real  analysis.  And  in   many  cases,  it  simply  does  not  work.  It   doesn't  work.  Why  it  doesn't  work?  You   can  have  correct  is  for  example  ISM  now   is  above  50.  So  what  it  can  still  take   half  a  year  for  the  markets  to  recover   based  on  this  you  know  new  ISM.  What   happens  in  that  half  a  year?  your  coins   go  down  minus  90%.  So,   but  yeah,  I  think  that  you  know  this   book  that  that  we're  going  to  be   releasing,  it's  uh  what?  It's  my  book.   What  book?  It's  my  book.  I'm  releasing  a   book.  It's  not  unreleased  yet.   Unreleased  yet.  Uh  it's  unreleased.  It's   unreleased.  I'm  still  deciding  on  the   name.  I  think  it's  going  to  be  hundred   billion  dollar  trades  because  looking  at   our  community  volume  were  around  there.   But  anyway,  it's  coming.  It's  coming.   The  only  thing  you  need  to  know,  it's   coming.  It's  coming.  Bigly  biggly  biggly   biggly.  If  you  want  not  to  miss  it,  go   to  go  to  the  newsletter  below.  I  I  will   in  the  coming  days  I  will  have  a   separate  signup  page  just  for  the  book   and  you  can  pre-order  there  and  so  on.   But  it's  not  it's  not  done  yet  for  now.   Just  go  to  the  newsletter.  Uh  so so   you're  in  the  loop  at least.  There  is  a   link  in  description  newsletter.  Join   there.  But  yeah  guys,  I  mean  this  book  I   I  will  give  it  away  to  everyone  I  know   on  uh  Christmas  on  like  physical  all  my   friends.  Like  it's  it's  a  lifesaver.   It's  a  lifesaver.  It's  crazy,  man.  It's   crazy.  Like,  it  can  literally  save  like   decades  of  your  life  instead  of  holding   something  down  then  down  and  down  and   down.  It's  going  to  be  great.   Uh,  atom  literally  went  to  zero  on  10   10.  Yeah,  no  liquidity.   Any  thoughts  on  Pola  dot?  The   I  I  can  only  give  you  short  opportunity   with  pol.  I  mean  you  see  yourself   short  it  if  it  goes  below  here.  That's   it.   It  still  has  room  to  fall.  I  mean  it's   price  discovery  down.  It  it  now  it  holds   this  sideways.  A  bit  of  a  relief.  It's   kind  of,  you  know,  it  did  similar  here.   A  bit  of  a  relief  and  then  boop,  went   down  and  you  could  have  shorted  it.  But   I  see  it  more  as  shorting.  You  know,   here  it  went  uh  sideways,  then  boop  all   the  way  here.  So  yeah,  now  it's  a  bit   sideways.  Let's  see  when  it  goes.  Path   of  least  resistance  is  down.  Okay,  it's   down.  Uh  should  you  short  now?  I  would   wait  for  it  to  go  below  here.  Okay,  I   would  just  wait  for  it.  Or  let's  check   on  the  daily.  Let's  check  Let's  check   which  trend  it  is  on  daily.   Okay,  another  thing  you  can  do  is  that   if  it  goes  bearish  on  the  daily,  you  can   short.  Now  it's  bullish  on  the  daily.   This  pump  made  it  bullish.  Next  time  it   goes  bearish,  fantastic  short  to   Yeah,  if  it  goes  below  here,  it  can  be   any  amount  of  percent  because  it's  price   discovery.  So  that  that's  ble  guys.  I   don't  know  if  you  want  me  to  comment  on   tech  or  something.  I  don't  know  even   what  to  say  because  I  don't  use  it  too   much.  I  used  it  before.  I  mean,  I   remember  in  the  early  last  cycle,  I  used   it  quite  a  bit  because  there  were  many   new  projects  launching  there,   but  they  all  died.  I  remember  I  was   using  Starlight.  What  is  it?  Star  Star   Starship.  Star  Stardust.  Stardust.  Yeah,   Stardust.  Or  it's  on  atom.  I  I  I  was   quite  an  enthusiast,  but  um  the   ecosystem  died  off  and  uh  the  price  I   miss   is  what  it  is.   I  understand  but  have  never  made  money   in  crypto  because  I  still  never  actually   press  the  buy  and  sell  buttons  at  the   right  times  despite  the  knowledge.  See   this  is  why  you  need  bulmania.com.  Go  to   bullmia.com  watch  the  free  training.  Uh   if  you  join  bulmania  you're  going to  get   the  money  line  the  money  scan  get   oneonone  coaching  because  as  you  say   it's  actually  also  a  big  gap  between   understanding  and  uh  doing  and  doing.   That's  why  I  tell  you  go  to  bullmay.com   sign  up.  Uh  you're  going  to  get  oneonone   coaching  like  you're  going  to  get  all  of   that.  It's  like  know  you're  reading   about  how  to  ride  the  bicycle  and  then   you  are  angry  that  you  don't  know  how  to   ride  the  bicycle  but  you  read  about  it   for  years.  You  jump  on  a  bike,  you  try   to  think  what  the  theory  taught  you.  So   yeah,  it's  it  it  is  a  big  gap  between   theory  and  execution.  But  uh  it's  also  a   big  gap  between  the  wrong  information   and  theory.  So  what  the  book  will  do  is   that  is  my  goal  with  it  is  to  close  the   gap  from  all  of  this,  you  know,   retardive  ideas  people  have  about   trading.  So  at least  they  know  the  how   it  actually  works   theoretically  but  then  it  is  still  a  gap   to  execution  like  you  say.  So  that's   where  we  have  the  the  uh  bullming.com   you  watch  the  video  you  get  one  one  code   you  get  the  full  package  basically  but   the  first  step  is  the  so  you  I  would  say   you  you're  maybe  30%  there  so  at least   you  understand  uh  but  then  you  need  to   put  into  practice  that's  the  next  step   back   okay  guys  I  think  that's  it  thanks  a  lot   for  being  here  great  questions  great  um   uh  great  discussions  let's  uh  wrap  it   up.  Big  shout  out.  Why,  man?  Time  flies   so  fast.  I  think  I  ended  my  content  on   like  15  minutes,  but  now  it's  15.  How  it   goes  so  fast.  You  guys  ask  great   questions.  Time  flies.  You  know,  time   flies  when  it's  fun  to  to  hang  out.  So,   holy  crap,  it's  already   man.  Time  flies,  guys.  But  that's  the   best.  I  mean,  it's  better  when  you  guys   set  the  agenda  because  I  mean,  sometimes   in  the  market  nothing  changes.  It's  the   same.  So  instead  of  me  regurgitating,   how  say  regurgitating?  The  same  thing.   It's  better  that  you  guys  ask,  we   discuss  what  you  want.  So  we're  going  to   be  back  tomorrow.  Big  shout  out  to  DAB   for  time  stamping  us.  And  enjoy  enjoy   your  Thursday.  Uh  and  see  you  tomorrow.   Goodbye,  guys.  Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Bye.",

Az elemző a korábbi középtávú évek, mint 2014 és 2018 hasonlóságait említi, ahol hasonló emelkedéseket figyeltek meg. Ugyanakkor figyelmeztet arra, hogy a jelen trend csapdának is bizonyulhat, mivel a piaci irányvonal továbbra is bearish. A következő lépés a 74 ezer dolláros ellenállás tesztelése lehet, amely komoly akadályt jelent. Az elemző hangsúlyozza, hogy a múltbeli mintázatok figyelembevételével a jövőbeli árfolyammozgások is előre meghatározhatók, de a tendencia továbbra is lefelé mutat. Bár rövid távú pumpát vár, a kontextust tekintve hosszú távú kilátások nem kedvezőek. A piacon való kereskedés körüli általános hangulat bearish, a kockázatok kezelésére és a profitrealizálásra is felhívja a figyelmet.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin is currently displaying a bullish trend, attempting to recover from a low of around $62,000 earlier this week to approximately $68,000. The analyst refers to similarities with previous midterm years like 2014 and 2018, where similar pumps were observed. However, caution is advised as the current trend may also prove to be a trap, with the overall market direction still bearish. The next significant resistance is identified at $74, indicating a challenge in further upward movement. Emphasizing past patterns, the analyst suggests that future price movements can be predicted; however, the prevailing sentiment remains downwards. While a short-term pump is anticipated, the long-term outlook does not appear favorable. The commentary underscores the importance of risk management and profit-taking strategies in the current market climate.",
