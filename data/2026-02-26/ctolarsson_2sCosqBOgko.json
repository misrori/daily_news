    "transcript": "Today,  deep  dive  in  Tesla,  the  chart,   valuation,  robotics  outlook.  I'll  also   cover  the  Bitcoin  chart.  Is  this  a   double  bottom  that  has  been  worth   waiting  for?  Tesla  is  a  paradox.  It  has   an  insane  valuation  valued  at  almost  400   times  current  earnings.  TTM  is  trailing   12  months.  So  based  on  that  PE  ratio,   Tesla  could  drop  90%  and  PE  would  still   be  high  at  40.  On  the  other  hand,  price   keeps  bumping  up  against  this   resistance,  keeps  trying  to  break  out,   which  would  set  targets  at  much  higher   prices.  And  Elon  Musk  has  agreed  to  this   bonus  program  where  he  only  gets  a  bonus   if  the  company  is  valued  in  a  range  from   2  trillion  market  cap  all  the  way  to   $8.5  trillion  market  cap  which  is   basically  double  of  Nvidia  today  which   corresponds  to  something  like  $533   per  share  all  the  way  to  $2,200   per  share.  So  which  one  is  it?  Do  we   have  90%  down  or  5x  up?  What  is  going   on?  What  could  drive  this  upside?  Is  it   the  robotics  outlook?  Frankly,  the  last   month  has  blown  my  mind.   Chinese  robot.   We  can  predict  in  the  future  that  our   payload  like  a  high.   Ah  no,  sorry.  The  last  one  was  Star   Wars,  and  there  will  probably  be  other   use  cases,  too.  C3PO  seems  clumsy  and   uninformed  compared  to  what  we  can   probably  choose  to  have  walking  around   in  our  homes  this  year.  The  most  wild   thing  to  me  is  the  speed  of  change.  Just   one  year,  2025  to  2026.  But  is  it   enough?  Can  it  bridge  this  insane   valuation?  I've  made  a  business  model   for  Tesla  to  try  to  answer  that.  In  my   old  life  in  telecom,  I  did  a  lot  of   business  cases  like  should  we  develop   this  or  that.  Especially  when  it  comes   to  tech.  Most  people  approach  modeling   the  wrong  way.  In  my  opinion,  they  try   to  find  some  financial  modeling  like  the   free  cash  flow  and  the  beta  growth  and   this  and  that.  In  my  experience,  that   stuff  never  works  in  exponential   disruptive  technology.  You  simply  can't   extrapolate  today  into  tomorrow  when  the   whole  world  is  getting  disrupted.  No   simple  wins  like  how  many  of  the  things   will  you  sell?  How  much  can  you  sell  the   thing  for?  How  much  profit  do  you  make   on  each  one?  Done.  Multiply.  So  R2D2   C3PO  and  I  have  built  this  simple  model.   How  many  Optimus  units  as  a  percentage   of  cars  sold?  Like  compared  to  people   buying  a  Tesla  car,  how  big  share  of   that  will  buy  an  Optimus  robot?  Then  I   put  the  same  margin  on  robots  as  for   their  course  and  we  get  the  profit  from   Optimus.  Then  the  FSD  the  full   self-drive  subscription.  I  put  a   moderate  to  bull  target  which  gives   revenue  and  very  high  margin  because   this  is  basically  software.  Then  we  have   robo  taxi  zero  today  and  a  moderate  case   for  ramp  up  to  600,000  robo  taxes.   Expectation  is  quite  high  profit.  I  put   10,000  here  but  estimates  vary  wildly   from  4k  to  60k.  If  it's  too  high  I  think   there  will  be  competition.  Then  we  have   the  course  which  is  the  most  analyzed.   2025  are  actuals  and  2026  pretty  well   analyzed.  Notably  I  excluded  the  FSD   here.  So  we  can  analyze  that  separately.   Energy  products  revenue  and  profits  and   other  services  and  we  get  the  revenue   and  the  profit.  PE  is  price  to  earnings   which  means  profit.  So  we  will   concentrate  on  the  right  graph  here  with   assumptions  I  did  of  Optimus  deliveries   from  2027  being  20%  of  core  volume  and   Elon  Musk  long-term  target  of  20,000   sale  price.  The  profit  from  Optimus  is   frankly  not  much.  It's  the  dark  blue   section  here  at  the  bottom.  FSD  is  a  big   portion.  The  self-drive  subscription.   Robo  taxi  also  becomes  a  huge  part.  So,   is  this  good?  Will  this  meet  the  KPIs  of   some  reasonable  valuation?  You  can  see   the  profit  is  growing  a  lot  here,  right?   Well,  actually  no.  Here  was  P  today.   Here  is  P  today.  If  share  price  goes  up   to  meet  Elon  Musk's  first  target,  here   is  P.  if  share  price  goes  up  to  meet  the   high  end  of  the  target  range  2,240.   But  the  problem  is  that  even  with  this   growth  in  profit,  it's  not  enough.  PE   would  be  93  or  still  396  at  the  higher   end  of  this  range.  And  is  that  high  or   low?  It's  super  high,  guys.  Here  are   historical  PE  numbers  from  the  past   decade  for  10  of  the  biggest  stocks.   Nvidia,  Apple,  Alphabet,  Microsoft,   Amazon,  Meta,  and  so  on.  And  you  can   really  see  here  what  an  outlier  the   Tesla  number  is  at  over  300.  And  even  as   a  median  over  the  period  and  the  median   of  the  median  is  30.  So  even  if  they  get   this  profit  growth  even  at  current  share   price  the  valuation  is  super  high  and   396  I  just  don't  think  it's  going  to   happen.  So  let's  assume  they  sell  more   Optimus  robots.  Let's  instead  say  that   they  deliver  the  same  number  of  Optimus   robots  as  they  deliver  cars.  Now  we  see   Optimus  here  in  profit  is  much  bigger.   Does  it  change  anything?  No,  not  really.   This  is  still  way  too  high.  We  need  much   more  profit  than  that.  What  if  they  sell   three  times  as  many  robots  as  they  sell   cars?  Okay,  now  it's  massively  bigger.   But  still  not  enough,  guys.  Not  if  you   want  to  reach  the  higher  end  of  the   target.  We  need  to  go  insane  here.  They   have  to  sell  five  times  as  many  Optimus   robots  as  they  sell  cores.  and  they  need   maybe  a  million  robo  taxes  and  they  need   maybe  10  million  FSD  subs  and  only  now   the  PE  starts  looking  reasonable  at  the   lower  end  of  the  range  but  still  not  at   the  higher  end  based  on  what  we   typically  see  in  the  stock  market.  So   you  see  what  I'm  doing  here.  It's  much   easier  to  understand  and  it's  much   easier  to  track  and  adjust  as  time  goes   on  and  we  get  actual  data.  So  forget   about  EBA  capex  adjustment  provisions   and  deferred  contingency.  You  sell   robots  or  not,  how  many  profit  or  not?   As  you  see  here,  we  need  to  put  in   absolutely  insane  assumptions  on  growth   and  sales  to  get  any  reasonable  PE   number.  What  about  the  cars?  Maybe  they   can  drastically  sell  more  cars  and   increase  margin  on  those.  I'm  not  so   sure.  If  I'm  looking  at  forward  oriented   markets  like  in  Vietnam,  they're  all   driving  Vinfast  EVs.  In  Thailand,   they're  driving  BYD  EVs  from  China.  I'm   driving  a  German  car  now,  which  feels   supreme  quality,  amazing  leather,   whisper  quiet,  great  sound  when  closing   the  door,  although  it  feels  stone  age   that  it  doesn't  drive  itself.  If  you   remember  Porter's  five  forces  from   school,  building  cars  is  not  great  as  a   business  model.  High  rivalry,  buying   power  is  high,  easy  to  switch,  basically   no  lock  in.  It  was  a  great  strategic   position  when  Tesla  was  the  only  company   that  could  build  a  good  electric  car  at   a  good  price.  Huge  entry  barrier,  but   now  new  entrance  clearly  are  able  to   join  the  fun.  I  have  personally  a  lot  of   experience  in  building  physical   high-tech  products  in  competition  with   Chinese  competitors.   That  is  tough.  Whatever  good  innovation   you  do,  given  some  time,  they  will  try   to  steal  and  copy  it.  And  partly  because   they  didn't  have  the  R&D  expense  to  come   up  with  it,  sometimes  sell  it  cheaper.   That's  why  I  broke  out  the  FSD  segment.   Perhaps  there  could  be  other   possibilities  for  Tesla  in  the  car   segment.  Could  they  license  the  FSD,  for   example?  If  it's  the  best  with  lowest   risk  for  accident,  I'd  be  very  happy  to   pay  $99  per  month  for  that  to  my  German   car.  Solar  panels,  batteries,  energy   solutions.  I  think  similar  competitive   situation  as  the  course.  But  I  heard  one   analyst  say  that  in  the  end,  no  one  will   even  remember  that  Tesla  ever  made   course.  Clearly,  a  lot  of  people  put   their  hope  to  the  robotics,  leveraging   the  AI  capabilities  of  Tesla,  but  with   the  AI  and  robotics,  we're  getting  the   Chinese  competition  there,  too.  Most  of   those  videos  in  the  beginning  were   Chinese  robots.  No  matter  how  good  Elon   is  at  building  factories,  innovation,   production,  pipelines,  his  Chinese   competitors  will  copy  everything  and  try   to  do  it  cheaper.  In  China,  there  will   be  no  work  life  balance,  no  labor   unions,  no  political  opposition  who  try   to  sabotage  them  and  no  regulation,   industry  espionage.  Maybe  EU  will  find   them.  They  will  say,  \"Yeah,  welcome  to   Beijing  and  try  to  sue  us  and  let's  see   how  that  goes.\"  Tesla  has  to  find  other   elements  as  differentiators,   things  that  can't  be  copied,  things   which  aren't  hardware  or  software.  One   such  thing  is  trust.  Again  going  back  to   my  experience  in  telecom,  some  of  our   Chinese  competitors  did  some  uh  how   should  I  say  not  so  trust  inspiring   things.  So  some  customers  started   thinking  do  I  even  want  a  Chinese  vendor   to  run  my  country's  most  critical   national  infrastructure  or  do  I  only   trust  that  Swedish  guy  to  do  it?  Perhaps   a  similar  situation  can  play  out  here.   Which  robot  will  you  and  I  trust  to  not   go  mad  one  day  or  fall  down  the  stairs   and  injure  our  children?  Which  robot  do   I  trust  to  not  watch  me  typing  my   password  and  then  log  in  while  I  sleep   to  steal  my  data?  Perhaps  Tesla's  track   record  of  operating  cars  will  become   important.  Even  if  there  is  a  cheaper   robot  that  can  do  better  back  flips,   perhaps  it  will  be  their  AI  model  we   trust.  We  loved  C3PO  for  its   personality,  not  for  its  motor  skills.   All  the  robots  will  be  able  to  do  back   flips  and  have  great  joints.  If  that's   commoditized,  perhaps  the  Chinese   companies  will  do  it  cheaper.  But  the   quality  of  the  AI  operating  them  will  no   doubt  be  key.  By  the  way,  I  will  update   this  sheet  as  time  goes  on  and  we  get   real  data  to  replace  some  of  the   predictions.  So,  this  is  just  the  start.   We'll  come  back  to  this  sheet  for  years   here  on  this  channel.  In  summary,   Tesla's  business  model  to  build  physical   products  in  competition  with  Chinese   competitors  is  tough.  Ask  me.  They  have   to  lean  in  the  softer  elements  like   trust.  Will  Elon  Musk  do  that?  Or  will   he  underestimate  the  Chinese  competitors   as  so  many  great  entrepreneurs  before   him  have  done  thinking  Tesla  can  just   build  better  physical  products  at  better   price  and  that's  it.  Let's  see.  I  do   think  humanoid  robots  can  become  big,   but  it  could  take  many  years  yet.  Even   the  greatest  successes  took  seemingly   forever  to  take  off.  In  telecom,  we   built  something  that  literally  every   person  on  the  planet  wanted.  Still,  it   took  decades  for  them  to  go  buy  it.  So,   what's  the  conclusion  for  the  price?  The   number  of  sales  it  takes  for  this  higher   range  valuation  to  make  any  sense.  Feels   overly  optimistic.  Put  differently,  it   feels  insane.  So,  am  I  saying  that  price   can't  go  up?  I  don't  think  that's  a   conclusion  at  all.  Let  me  explain.  Price   of  a  stock  is  different  from  the  price   of  a  coin  in  blockchain.  But  the   difference  is  mainly  on  the  downside.  If   a  stock  drops  below  a  certain  point,   someone  will  come  and  buy  the  whole   company  by  all  the  shares.  Just  check   the  discussions  on  PayPal.  Now  for   example,  because  all  the  shares  in  a   company  is  worth  something,  you  get  the   future  profits.  But  if  you  have  all  the   coins  in  a  blockchain  that  is  worth   nothing.  So  there  is  no  floor  in   blockchain.  something  that  the  new   generation  of  altcoin  investors  discover   every  cycle.  But  for  stocks  in  a   fundamentally  healthy  company,  there  is   a  floor.  But  is  there  a  ceiling?  I'd  say   not  really.  A  stock  can  absolutely  start   trading  like  a  memecoin  where  people   just  buy  it  because  they  think  the  price   will  go  up  and  they  intend  to  make  money   by  selling  the  share  at  a  higher  price,   not  by  having  a  good  return  on  the   dividend  based  on  the  price  to  earning   ratio.  So  what  I  think  will  happen   instead  is  this.  There  will  be  wild   swings  in  both  directions  because   nothing  here  can  be  explained  by  usual   economic  models.  So  some  analysts  will   wake  up  one  day  and  say,  \"Guys,  what  the   f  are  we  doing?  These  numbers  are   bonkers.  We  have  to  get  out.\"  Everyone   panic  cells  and  price  dumps  like  crazy.   We  got  bamboozled  thinking  it's  the  new   economy.  There's  no  money  here,  just   dreams.  But  then  the  next  day  or  month   or  year,  we  get  blown  away  by  the   technology  and  the  potential.  And  there   are  suddenly  signs  of  limitless   potential.  And  everyone  feels  in  their   hearts,  this  is  incredible.  I  have  to   own  a  share  of  this  P  numbers  or  not.   And  everyone  buys.  Hype  is  on  again.  And   it  goes  up  like  crazy  again.  I  like   that.  Then  there  is  more  money-making   potential  here  than  if  it  just  slowly   slowly  goes  upward  in  a  straight  line.   That  also  means  I  will  rely  heavier  on   my  process.  I  will  not  buy  and  hold  from   fundamental  perspective.  I  will  count  on   that  I  can  ride  most  of  the  uptrends   with  most  of  the  money  and  dodge  most  of   the  downtrends  because  I  think  this   chart  can  get  wild  over  the  years  to   come  in  both  directions.  Another   limitless  opportunity  with  limitless   possibilities  to  go  unlimited  distance   in  both  directions  is  Bitcoin.  If  you're   in  the  Discord,  I've  shared  my  thoughts   every  step  this  weeks.  Medium-term,  this   could  be  a  bottom.  I  shared  previously   that  I  bought  on  this  support  bounce.   And  I  intend  to  add  another  position  if   this  double  bottom  of  sorts  confirms.   And  as  a  reminder,  that  is  not  when  the   second  touch  happens,  but  when  the  high   between  the  bottoms  is  breached,  which   would  be  here  at  70  to  72,000.  And  then   I  look  at  yet  one  more  position  if  this   key  level  at  74K  is  reclaimed.  But  these   are  gamble  entries  because  Lion  line  is   still  solid  blue.  So  I  intend  to   aggressively  move  stops  into  profit  and   try  not  to  hold  these  into  a  loss.  If   the  trend  then  turns  up  and  we  sit  with   this  nice  bottom  pattern  in  the  chart   behind  us,  I  will  be  fullon  bull  again.   But  as  I  have  repeated  many  times,  I   will  still  be  wary  because  if  this  bare   market  lasts  the  same  duration  as  the   previous  bare  market  that  will  place  a   bottom  in  October,  not  now  in  February.   So  I  will  still  keep  that  scenario,  that   possibility  in  mind.  At  the  end  of  the   day,  I  will  simply  react  to  whatever   happens.  Bitcoin  cannot  go  to  200,000,   500,000,   $1  million  with  the  trend  down.  Guys,  no   need  to  be  stressed.  What  I  can  say  for   sure  is  that  the  sci-fi  of  my  childhood   is  coming  true  in  my  lifetime.  Thinking   AI,  humanoid  robots,  landing  rockets,   self-driving  cars,  a  knowit  all  device   in  my  pocket,  video  call  to  any  human  on   the  planet,  telepathy  through  brain   implants,  the  actual  Babelfish  as  a   freaking  consumer  product,  and  we  have   digital  money  now.

A videóban a Tesla robotikai kilátásait és a pénzügyi modellezés helyességét is vizsgálja, hangsúlyozva, hogy a hagyományos pénzügyi mutatók nem alkalmazhatóak a zavaró technológiákra. Az elemző azt javasolja, hogy ha a cég ötödik annyi Optimus robotot ad el, mint az autóból, akkor csak akkor lehetne reális értékelést készíteni. Az egész szektorban érezhető a növekvő verseny, főként Kínából, ami alapvetően befolyásolhatja a Tesla jövőbeli kilátásait. Az FSD és a robottaxi szolgáltatások jövője is kérdéses, és a legújabb trendek mellett a Tesla márkájának bizalma kulcsfontosságú tényező lehet.",
    "summary_en": "Tesla's valuation is alarmingly high, almost 400 times its current earnings, implying that the stock price could drop by 90% without the PE ratio falling to an acceptable level. The video examines Tesla's robotics outlook and the validity of financial modeling, underscoring that traditional financial metrics are inadequate for disruptive technologies. The analyst argues that a realistic valuation would require the company to sell five times as many Optimus robots as cars. Increased competition, particularly from China, poses a significant threat to Tesla’s future prospects. The future of FSD and robo-taxi services is also uncertain, and brand trust may prove to be a crucial factor.",
