Heat.   All  right,  welcome  because  today  today's   video  is  very  special.  We're  going  to  be   going  over  the  big  boogeyman  in  crypto   and  trying  to  understand  is  it  possible,   is  it  true  that  one  firm  has  been  able   to  suppress  the  price  of  Bitcoin  and   crypto.  Now,  everyone  loves  a  good   conspiracy.  But  our  goal  here  is  not   just  to  spread  conspiratorial  thinking.   It's  to  understand,  is  this  actually  the   cause  of  Bitcoin  and  crypto  going  down?   Is  Jane  Street  the  dark  and  anonymous   firm  that  personally  recruited  Sam   Bankman  Freed  as  his  first  role  in  his   career?  Is  Jane  Street  the  boogeyman   that  has  been  crashing  crypto  since   2021?   The  answers  are  not  exactly  black  and   white  because  we  know  for  sure  that  they   were  instrumental  in  the  collapse  of   Luna  in  2022,  but  their  role  in  the   current  Bitcoin  and  crypto  collapse  is   going  to  become  much  clearer  over  the   coming  days  and  weeks.  We've  got  all  the   dirty  deets  for  you  and  this  is  going  to   be  a  great  show.  And  then  we're  going  to   talk  about  what  I  see  as  the  new   altcoins.  And  we're  going  to  be  talking   about  that  uh  at  the  halfway  point  in   the  show.  So,  if  you  have  any  questions,   make  sure  to  fire  them  off  in  the  chat.   But  wait  until  I'm  a  little  bit  further   in  and  then  I  can  get  into  the  Q&A.  Uh   and  then  we'll  be  talking  about  what  is   the  reality  of  this  boogeyman.  Is  it   possible  that  one  firm  has  derailed   Bitcoin  from  being  digital  gold  and   relegated  it  to  being  dumped  out  like  a   baby  with  the  bathwater  in  the  software   SAS  apocalypse  that  we  find  ourselves   in.  It's  going  to  be  an  interesting  one.   And  then  we're  going  to  talk  about  where   the  real  money  is  being  made.  And  I'm   going  to  shout  out  uh  some  people  that  I   think  you  should  be  paying  attention  to   that  have  helped  me  navigate  this  world.   But  also,  I  just  think  that  this  is   where  the  big  game  is  right  now.  If  you   are  the  type  of  person  who  wants  to   speculate  in  crypto,  I'm  going  to  give   you  the  keys,  I  think,  to  investing   right  now  and  over  the  course  of  the   next  few  years.  Um,   shout  out  to  the  chat.  Thank  you  guys   for  showing  up.  Uh,  Crypto  Winter,  we've   got  each  other.  Let's  keep  each  other   warm.  All right,  let's  keep  each  other   nice  and  warm  and  fuzzy  because  right   now  we're  going  to  get  into  it.  All   right,   breaking.  We  now  have  a  lawsuit  filed  by   Donald  Trump's  media  company  DJT  and  he   is  alleging  along  with  others  that  Jane   Street  Citadel  have  now  been  crashing   and  manipulating  down  the  price  of   Bitcoin.  This  is  very  spicy  to tea.  You   can  see  it's  an  official  filing  here.   And  this  will  produce  what  this  will   produce  is  disclosures  and  on  there   testimony  where  over  the  course  of   potentially  months,  potentially  years,   we  will  find  out  whether  this  firm  has   been  manipulating  down  the  price  of   Bitcoin.  Now,  the  positive  here  is  that   we  will  finally  know  if  there  is  some   kind  of  manipulation  or  boogeyman.  And   the  question  would  be  why  Jane  Street?   If  you  guys  have  been  on  Twitter  over   the  last  few  days,  you've  probably  seen   this  story,  but  we're  going  to  break  it   down  for  you  right  now.  This  all  started   with  a  Zero  Hedge  post  saying  that   Terraform  Labs,  which  was  the  the  labs   company,  if  you  guys  don't  know  how   crypto  works,  here's  how  it  works.  There   is  a  usually  a  developer,  a  builder  in  a   you  know,  a  tier  one  or  or  a  first,  I   don't  know how  do  I  say  this,  in  one  of   the  main  countries,  one  of  the  the   advanced  countries  like  America,  like   Europe,  like  uh  China,  whatever  it  might   be.  and  they  want  to  build  a  crypto   project,  but  because  of  the  laws,   they're  so  ambiguous,  they're  so   unclear,  and  because  of  the  hostile   regulatory  climate  um  under  even  Trump   won  and  Biden,  the  way  that  the  legal   structures  would  work  is  that  these  uh   projects  would  be  created  by  offshore   foundations.  So,  you'd  have  foundations   set  up  in  Panama,  in  the  British  Virgin   Islands,  in  Singapore,  in  um  the   Marshall  Islands,  in  random   jurisdictions  that  will  just  allow  for   these  foundations  to  be  set  up.  And  it   allows  for  the  team  to  build  uh  and  then   have  some  of  the  some  of  the  tech  be   built  onshore  and  some  of  the  regulatory   scrutinous  stuff  happen  offshore  so  that   people  can  just  have  some  kind  of   legally  defensible  way  to  build  in   crypto  while  the  rules  were  unclear.  So   the  Terraform  entity  was  the  labs   company.  So  that  would  be  like  the   centralized  company  that  helps  actually   the  brain  operating  the  development  of   Terra  Luna,  right?  And  so  then  you  have   I  think  the  Luna  Foundation  or  the  Terra   Luna  Foundation.  I  don't know  what  their   foundation  was  called.  There's  usually  a   labs  company  and  then  there  was  a   foundation  company.  And  in  this  case,   Terraform  was  saying,  and  this  is  the   actual  builder  of  Luna  was  saying,  \"Hey,   it  wasn't  our  fault  that  Luna  collapsed.   It  was  actually  these  guys.  Jane   Street.\"  Now,  of  course,  this  might  be   repetitive  for  you  if  you've  seen  some   of  the  reporting  over  the  last  few  days,   but  I'm  just  going  to  make  this  very   clear  because  I  think  it's  really   important  that  you  guys  know  what   happened  here.  Okay.  So,  first  and   foremost,  okay,  this  all  started  this   all  started  um  actually  let's  go  into   yes,  so  this  started  as  Luna  was   planning  to  lower  the  amount  of  interest   it  was  paying  in  its  ankor  protocol.  If   you  guys  remember,  you  could  lock  up   money  in  Luna  or  Anchor  and  it  would  pay   you  20%  APY  and  it  just  continued  to   grow  and  grow  and  grow  until  it  was   paying  out  billions  of  dollars  per   quarter.  Not  sustainable.  Everybody  knew   that  this  wasn't  sustainable  long-term   and  so  they  were  planning  to  transition   to  a  new  model  uh  gradually  declining   from  the  20%  rate  to  something   ostensibly  more  sustainable.  And  as  a   private  group  they  decided  they  were   going  to  if  you  can  see  my  cursor  here   they  were  going  to  transition  from  one   uh  pool  the  notice  the  curve  or  the   three  pool  to  the  four  pool  right  and  to   do  this  what  they  did  was  they  removed   some  of  the  liquidity  and  they  were   planning  to  read  it  to  the  next  pool.   Now  when  you  remove  liquidity   effectively  each  buy  and  sell  becomes   more  impactful.  So  if  I  remove  say  a   third  of  the  liquidity  in  any  liquidity   pool  on  a  DEX  then  every  dollar  that's   bought  or  sold  will  move  the  price  more.   So  with  less  liquidity  in  this  case  a   seller  could  potentially  lower  the  price   of  what  was  supposed  to  be  a  stable   coin.  And  this  is  where  you  get  Jane   Street.  So  they  were  expected  to  move   this  $150  million  to  a  new  pool  the  next   week,  but  within  10  minutes,  right,  it   was  not  publicly  announced.  It  was  not   publicly  announced.  Okay.  And  then   within  10  minutes  of  Terraform's   withdrawal  of  150  million,  Jane  Street   made  its  single  biggest  trade  of  US,  the   stable  coin,  selling  85  million  US  in   one  transaction.   85  million  in  one  transaction,  right?   That  is  insane  to  do  this  10  minutes   after  the  principal  has  removed   significant  liquidity.  The  only  reason   why  you  would  do  that  was  in  attempt  to   what's  called  break  the  peg,  meaning   that  you  want  to  damage  this  stable  coin   and  remove  it  from  being  traded  onetoone   with  the  dollar.  The  best  way  to  do  that   is  to  actually  break  the  peg  and  get   people  scared.  And  then  once  people  are   scared,  then  they  all  start  selling   worried  that  it  won't  resume  and  regain   the  peg  or  rep.  So  they  immediately  sold   $85  million  in  one  transaction,  which  is   absolutely  insane  to  do.  And  the  only   way  you  can  describe  that  is  extreme   predatory  behavior  trying  to  crash  the   US  stable  coin.  Okay,  that  85  million   trade  was  the  largest,  let  me  bring  this   uh  window  up  for  you.  That  85  million   trade  was  the  largest  single  swap  on  the   curve  3  pool  and  precipitated  a  steep   selloff  in  US.  A  sell-off  that   ultimately  collapsed  the  Terra   ecosystem.  I  just  realized  my  mic  was  a   little  low.  So  we  have  boosted  that.   Okay.  Um  sorry  headphones  users.  Okay.   So,  this  is  where  we  get  the  actual   follow-on  where  it  appears  that  there   was  this  private  chat  where  they  had   already  been  talking  about  a  fund  raise   and  it  was  a  private  unreleased   non-public  piece  of  information  that   this  transition  between  the  three  pool   and  the  fourpool  was  going  to  happen.   I'm  not  going  to  bore  you  with  all  the   details  here,  but  effectively  this  is   the  crux  of  what  the  argument  of  what   the  lawsuit  is,  is  that  they   purposefully  deeged  the  US  uh  stable   coin  and  likely  were  shorting  at  the   same  time  knowing  that  they  would  create   a  bank  run  and  knowing  that  it  would   collapse  Luna.  And  they  did  this  on   material.  As  it  says,  these  pieces  of   information  were  not  public  as  uh   Granier  exclusively  noted  or  expressly   noted.  Trans  Terraform  uh  reasonably   expected  that  Jen  Jane  Street  and   Granier  would  keep  this  sensitive   information  about  its  financial   condition  confidential.  Okay,  so  this  is   the  big  deal.  They  took  private   non-public  information  and  they  clearly   tried  to  break  the  peg  by  selling  $85   million  in  one  transaction,  which  is  an   insanely  predatory  and  just  downright   awful  thing  to  do,  right?  But  here's   where  we  get  interesting.  Here's  where   we  get  very  interesting.  Who  is  Jane   Street?  Who  is  this  mystery  firm  that   all  of  a  sudden  is  at  the  center  of  the   US  Luna  protocol?  Well,  since  2020,  Jane   Street  has  managed  to  become  one  of  the   most  profitable  trading  firms  in  all  of   Wall  Street,  actually  making  more  money   than  Goldman  Sachs  and  almost  every   other  investment  bank.  Okay,  they  are  a   wonder  firm.  And  if  you  look  at  their   profits,  what  do  you  notice?  Well,   they're  just  humming  along.  They're   doing  okay.  But  then  in  2020  when  the   DeFi  and  crypto  bull  runs  kick  off,  look   at  these  revenues.  Look  at  how  they   jumped.  Okay,  this  is  where  they  are   making  their  real  money  is  in  crypto.   Okay,  so  they  came  out  of  nowhere.  Very   interestingly,  this  guy  Rob  Granieri   runs  one  of  the  most  profitable  trading   firms  on  Wall  Street.  Probably  never   heard  of  him  because  no  public  photos  of   him  exist  for  25  years.  That  is  until   Bloomberg  published  this  one  photo  last   year.  very  random  photo.  Doesn't  even   look  like  he  posed  for  it,  right?  He's  a   Burning  Man  type  guy.  I  don't  think  that   really  matters,  but  he's  donated,  you   know,  to  both  Republicans  and  Democrats   and  he  hedges  his  politics.  So,  um,  you   know,  there's  not  really  any  clear  tie   as  to  anything,  but  this  guy  is  a  hedge   fund  guy.  Okay,  so  now  let's  go  down  the   rabbit  hole  here.  So,  uh,  there's  also   weird  stuff  about  Jane  Street.  For  one,   they  personally  recruited  Sam  Bankman   Freed,  this  guy  Rob  Granny,  right?  He   personally  recruited  Sam  Bankman  Freed   to  work  there.  And  that's  where  Sam   Bankman  Freed  learned  to  trade  was  Jane   Street.  They're  a  very  very  clandestine   and  uh  not  so  much  is  known  about  this   firm.  Uh  but  they're  a  quant  firm  in  New   York.  Okay.  They  operate  uh  like  an   anarchist  commune.  They  claim  they  don't   have  CEOs,  they  don't  have  leadership,   they  just  have  a  bunch  of  people  working   together.  Um,  this  is  just  part  of  this   philosophical  thing  that  you  see   underpinning  some  of  the  most  powerful   and  oftentimes  most  malicious  actors  in   the  world  is  you  see  this  like  ethics   framework  and  we  saw  it  with  SPF  and   what's  called  EA  which  was  this  um   something  altruism.  It  was  uh  ex   extensible.  I  forgot  what  I  forgot  the  E   stands  for,  but  it's  something  altruism   where  you  essentially  can  excuse  any   action  if  you  believe  it's  in  the   service  of  altruism.  And  so,  you  know,   Sam  often  times  when  he  was  discussing   and  reflecting  on  the  things  he  did,  the   people  he  stole  from,  he  didn't  have   remorse  because  he  had  invested  that   money  into  causes  that  he  thought  were   good,  like  medical  research  or  AI  or   whatever  he  thought  justified  this   action  because  his  ethical  framework   believes  that  the  ends  justify  the  means   in  that  if  the  the  action  itself   produces  what  you  believe  as  an   altruistic  outcome,  it  doesn't  matter   what  you  do.  And  that  is  uh  something   that  I  think  is  really  important  because   it's  just  important  that  you  know  that   this  is  how  some  of  the  most  influential   people  in  the  world  think  and  I   personally  don't  agree  with  that  right   and  that's  my  belief  I  don't  think  you   can  excuse  any  action  by  saying  in  10   years  or  20  years  this  good  thing  will   happen  you  can't  just  do  that  and  these   are  the  consequences  right  you  see  a  lot   of  human  uh  pain  and  suffering  caused  by   someone  who  believes  oh  no  but  my   altruistic  philosophy  is  why  this  is   okay  and  so  Um,  this  is  obviously  they   tell  the  story  a  little  bit  about  Teral   Luna  in  May,  uh,  the  10-minute  trade,   and  apparently  there  was  an  assistant   named  Bryce  Pratt,  or  he  was  an  intern   that  effectively  joined,  uh,  Jane  Street   in  2021,  and  he  was  the  the  one  there   was  a  chat  called  Bryce's  Secret  where   he  was  funneling  secret  information   between  the  two  entities.  Okay.  But  what   they're  saying  is  that  this  isn't  their   first  rodeo.  That  they've  effectively   been  kicked  out  of  India  for   manipulating  the  markets  over  there  and   effectively  they're  not  allowed  to  trade   in  India  and  they  were  kicked  out  by   India  Security  and  Exchange  Board  the   SEBI  and  so  they  are  well  known  for   being  market  manipulators  and  this  is   not  their  first  rodeo.  The  question  is   uh  since  this  modern  Bitcoin  ETF  era,   what  have  they  been  up  to?  Because  that   is  something  that  is  highly  highly   relevant.  Okay,  it's  worth  noting  that   Jane  Street  is  one  of  the  only  firms,  is   the  only  market  maker  that  is  on  every   single  Bitcoin  ETF.  They  signed  up  to  be   a  partner  on  every  single  Bitcoin  ETF.   Okay,  so  the  general  thought  process   here  is  that  these  guys  have  figured  out   how  to  manipulate  Bitcoin  and  the  price   of  it  in  such  a  way  that  they  can   continually  put  downward  pressure  on  the   price.  And  uh  this  had  led  this  led  to   something  called  the  10  a.m.  slam  where   everyone  believes  that  this  was  uh  them   effectively  creating  a  10:00  a.m.  uh   Eastern  time  slam  where  there  was  a  big   sell-off  at  10  a.m.  which  we've  seen   very  obviously  on  the  charts  for  the   last  several  months  in  Bitcoin.  Um  and   their  13F  confirms  a  massive   positioning.  This  time  they  have  400%   more  uh  400%  more  473%  more  stock  in   Micro  Strategy.  So  what  they  do  is  they   short,  they  hold  spot  and  people   effectively  think  that  while  they're   holding  the  short  they  are  accumulating   spot  so  it's  delta  neutral.  They  build   up  huge  positions  and  then  while  they're   shorting  they  end  up  selling  all  their   spot  creating  a  price  fluctuation   downward.  So  they  profit  off  the  short   way  more  than  they  lose  off  selling  the   spot  tokens  and  then  they  rinse  and   repeat.  Now  is  it  illegal?  I  don't  I   don't  actually  know  if  that's  legal  or   illegal  but  it  is  manipulation,  right?   It  is  price  manipulation  and  so  I  would   like  to  think  that  it's  illegal.  Now   what  people  are  pointing  out  here  is   that  just  yesterday,  the  day  after  all   of  this  starts  to  come  to  light,  we  see   Bitcoin  and  crypto  have  this  massive   massive  relief  bounce.  Bitcoin  hit  70K.   Alts  are  flying.  You  see  some  alts  like   uh  up  here  in  24%  on  circle  circle   stock.  You  see  a  bunch  of  alts  flying  30   40  50%.  And  the  question  is  was  that  it?   Did  we  find  the  boogeyman?  Is  the   boogeyman  dead?  Have  we  shined  a  light   on  the  vampire?  And  can  we  now  go  back   to  living  a  normal  life  here  in   cryptoland,  just  doing  normal  things   like  summoning  circles  for  our  bags  and   praying  to  Pepe?  Like,  can  we  just  go   back  to  the  normal  [ __ ]  Okay,  maybe.   Um,  I  think  that  if  you're  going  to  get   my  honest  opinion  here,  now  it's  time  to   be  real.  I  think  that   all  of  these  things  are  interesting.  But   let's  look  at  the  charts.  If  Jane  Street   is  on  the  back  foot,  and  that's   genuinely  true,  then  we  should  see  the   trend  change.  And  right  now,  what  we've   seen  is  not  that.  Look  at  Bitcoin.  Even   Bitcoin,  the  best  coin  in  crypto,  right?   We  have  just  seen  this  revival  bounce,   but  it  didn't  hit  our  key  level  of  72K,   and  it  didn't  even  get  above  this  prior   wick  high  of  70K.  You  can  see  that   pretty  much  um  as  far  as  right  now  uh   crypto  is  not  in  any  kind  of  reversal   pattern  and  Bitcoin  is  not  showing  any   signs  of  genuine  reversal  because  it's   not  even  over  this  recent  wick  high.  So   is  it  possible?  Is  it  possible  that   we're  starting  a  reversal?  Maybe.  But   remember  our  system  is  very  very  simple.   And  again  I've  learned  this  trading   system  from  a  buddy  of  mine  now  I'm   proud  to  call  him  a  friend  Brandon  Hong.   I  think  you  should  check  him  out.  He's   got  a  great  trading  system.  Very  simple.   But  the  biggest  thing  that  I  think  is   the  takeaway  is  it's  simple  and   objective,  right?  If  we  are  making   higher  highs  and  higher  lows,  that's   bullish.  And  if  we  are  not,  then  that's   not  bullish.  So,  we  just  have  to   understand  that  until  we  make  a  new  high   over  this  72K,  that  would  be  the  first   uh  big  boss  to  slay.  But  really,  it's   this  80K  range  that  we  want  to  get  above   to  start  actually  seeing  really  bullish   action  in  crypto.  For  now,  this  is  a   nice  and  compelling  story.  But  we  don't   trade  just  the  news.  Not  anymore  on  this   channel.  We  have  a  simple  trading   system.  So  right  now,  as  fun  as  this  is,   as  and  as  we  might  see  Jane  Street  get   exposed  here  and  get  the  garlic  thrown   all  over  them  like  the  vampire  they  are.   Obviously,  they  seem  weird.  They  seem   shady.  I  don't  know  anything  about  it,   though.  And  the  truth  is  that  very  well   might  not  be  the  case.  We  have  to  accept   that  all  these  things  might  be  true  and   there  might  be  other  valid  reasons  why   Bitcoin  is  dumping.  And  that  is  the  hard   part  for  us  as  a  crypto  community  is   just  to  say,  \"Yeah,  all  that  might  be   true.\"  And  we  still  just  saw  one  of  the   oldest  Satoshi  era  wallets  of  all  time   dump  a  billion  dollars  in  Bitcoin  last   week.  We  saw  Vitalic  sell  $7  million  of   Ethereum  last  week.  So  maybe,  just   maybe,  it's  not  just  Jane  Street  and  the   Jane  Street  Blues.  Maybe  we  have  other   problems  in  cryptoland  that  we  just  need   to  chew  through.  That  we  just  need  to   chew  through.  And  that's  the  hard  truth   that  I  think  we  all  just  need  to  be  okay   with.  Now,  in  the  meantime,  I  think  this   is  the  most  important  thing  that  we  can   see  because  the  Clarity  Act  has  stopped   the  actual  innovation  in  crypto  from   benefiting  the  token  holders  through   what's  called  alignment.  Now,  until  we   get  true  alignment,  I  don't  believe  that   we  will  get  to  see  the  actual  the  real   altcoins,  as  I'm  calling  them,  take   proper  um  dominance  in  the  market.  And   we're  going  to  talk  about  what  the  real   altcoins  are  right  now.  Because  altcoins   as  a  as  a  rule,  altcoins  as  we  see  them   are  these  getrich  mechanisms.  You  buy  in   low,  you  ride  it  up,  you  [ __ ]  you  get   excited,  you  get  the  adrenaline,  you  get   an  extreme  pump  to  your  net  worth.  But   that,  my  friends,  is  the  point  of  early   investing  is  you  want  to  have  this   massive  upside.  The  big  problem  with   altcoins  is  that  they  have  not  been   giving  these  wealth  creation  events.  Not   really  since  early  2024,  late  2023.  Yes,   there  was  a  sort  of  big  pump  at  the  end   of  2024,  but  the  real  big,  you  know,   recent  alt  season  happened  through  like   memes  and  gaming  and  all  that  fun  stuff   at  the  beginning  of  2024,  end  of  2023,   and  then  before  that  it  was  2021.  And   since  then,  altcoins  have  not  been  a   great  wealth-b  buildinging  mechanism   because  it's  just  been  too  hard.  The   pumps  have  been  too  short-lived.  So,   what  I  wanted  to  show  you  is  effectively   this,  which  is  the  actual  altcoins,   right?  The  real  altcoins  right  now  are   private  markets.  Those  are  the  altcoins.   And  again,  big  shout  out,  you  guys   should  definitely  be  following  Brandon   Hong  on  Twitter.  He  has  been  helping  me   understand  this  world.  Uh,  actually  very   much  so  on  the  front  ends  of  this,   helping  me  learn  more  and  actually  get   involved  myself  with  owning  some  of   these  robotics  and  AI  startups.  These   are  the  multipliers  that  we  have  wanted   for  our  altcoins.  103x  out  of  anthropic,   229x  out  of  figure  AI,  you  know,  230x   out  of  XAI,  10.3x  out  of  SpaceX,  right?   27x  out  of  Open  AAI.  Like,  this  is   altcoin  style  gains.  The  difference  is   that  these  aren't  liquid.  You  can't  just   invest  into  them  as  a  Joe  Schmo.  You   can't  just  be  a  retail  punter  and  get   access  to  them.  But  this  is  where  all  of   the  gains  are  happening.  This  is  where   the  real  money  is  being  made.  And  this   are  this  is  the  altcoins.  And  what  are   the  main  coins?  Well,  the  main  coins  are   Google  and  Tesla  and  the  Mag  7.  Those   are  the  the  top  tech  stocks.  The   altcoins  are  the  privately  held  super   disruptive  companies  in  AI  robotics  that   are  not  currently  able  to  be  bought   publicly.   But  there  are  ways  to  buy  them.  There   are  ways  to  buy  them.  And  that  should  be   the  mission  of  this  channel  and  all   other  channels  right  now  is  to  look  at   how  to  get  into  the  best  assets  known  to   man.  at  least  for  the  next  few  years.  I   think  the  AI  and  robotics  trend  will   continue  and  we  will  see  some  IPOs  and   that  will  set  set  some  ceilings  on  these   valuations  like  whatever  open  AAI  ends   up  achieving  in  their  IPO  that  will  be  a   benchmark.  Okay,  can  anthropic  hit  that?   Okay,  can  you  know  XAI  hit  that  if  it   goes  public  or  SpaceX  whatever  they   decide  to  launch  as  that  mechanism?   This  is  going  to  be  a  golden  era  of  this   new  wave  of  tech  going  public.  But  right   now,  unfortunately,  a  lot  of  this  stuff   is  in  the  private  markets.  And  that's   annoying  if  you're  just  a  retail   investor,  you're  just  an  average,  you   don't  have  accredited  status.  But   there's  going  to  be  ways,  and  I'm  going   to  be  working  hard  to  figure  out  ways  to   get  access  to  those  deals  and  to  source   those  deals  early  because  this  is  really   where  the  big  dogs  are  making  all  their   money.  All  the  big  boys  are  chucking   tens  of  millions  of  dollars  into  these   early  deals  and  just  riding  them  up.  And   every  like  round  is  just  a  markup.   There's  no  big  dumps.  There's  no  90%   retracements.  It's  just  most  of  these   companies,  if  they're  part  of  the  elite   cohort,  just  keep  repricing  upwards.  And   I  think  that  this  is  where  the  new   altcoins  are.  This  is  where  the  new  bull   run  is.  And  this  is  where  the  actual  way   to  get  rich  over  the  next  few  years  will   be.  I  believe  crypto  will  eventually   bottom.  and  that  this  Clarity  Act  will   bring  that  energy  into  crypto.  That's  my   belief  is  that  the  Clarity  Act  is   required  to  make  this  group  of  companies   crypto  companies.  You  need  token   alignment  with  actual  equity  because   right  now  you  can't  give  token  holders   true  equity  like  you  know  incentives  and   ownership  of  a  project.  You  can't  do  it   legally.  And  when  you  can  do  that,  that   will  allow  for  these  early  stage   companies  to  make  it  into  a  public  arena   faster.  Um,  and  so  I  do  think  that  this   is  utterly  critical  and  I  think  over   time  crypto  becomes  the  early  stage   venture  playground  that  everybody  knows   and  loves  it  to  be.  But  for  now,  it's   the  non-crypto  earlystage  venture  that's   going  bananas  with  AI  and  robotics.  And   I  believe  that  the  AI  trade,  especially   um  with  valuations  near  a  trillion   dollars,  probably  not  going  to  give  you   100x  nowhere,  no  time  soon.  But  I  think   the  robotic  side  of  this  is  where   there's  a  lot  of  excitement  and  a  lot  of   uh  huge  five  10  and  even  you  know  50x   opportunities  over  time.  So  that  is   where  I  think  the  new  altcoins  are.   That's  what  I  want  to  be  helping   investigate  with  all  of  you  and  then  you   know  doing  whatever  we  can  as  normal   people.  Obviously  I'm  just  like  you  in  a   lot  of  ways.  I  am  an  accredited  investor   but  I'm  not  an  insider  in  Silicon   Valley.  I'm  not  an  insider,  but  I  want   to  work  to  build  up  a  community  of   people  who  care  about  this  and  then   maybe  as  a  community  we  can  leverage  our   way  in.  So  that  would  be  really  cool.  I   mean  hopefully  we  can  build  something  of   interest  here  so  that  we  can  get  access   to  this  stuff  because  I  think that  this   stuff  is  where  the  real  wealth  is  being   made.  It's  not  a  question  of  I  think  it.   It  is  where  the  real  wealth  is  being   made.  And  I  think  that  you  know  for  the   next  probably  four  years  or  so  before   robotics  start  to  really  roll  out  mass   commercialized  the  speculation  will  be   incredible  and  the  valuations  will   continue  to  climb.  So  that  that's  where   my  head's  at.  I'm  curious  what  the  chat   thinks.   Dude  is  wolfing  like  a  mofo.   Big  dogs  sitting  in  stables  and  BRC   waiting  for  the  next  thing.  Yeah,  I  I   think  so.  So,  I  think  a  lot  of  the  big   dogs  are  just  uh  sitting  in  gold  right   now.  Dorsy  just  five.  Yeah.  So,  I   actually  have  the  Jack  Dorsey  thing   right  here.  Uh  let  me  bring  this  up   because  that  is  absolutely  a  massive   massive  piece  of  news.  Um   check  this  out.   This  is  the  next  step  of  AI.  And  this  is   why  it's  important  not  to  get  like   insanely  bearish  because  what's  going  to   happen  is  AI  is  going  to  start  being   implemented  into  companies.  Those   companies  are  going  to  start  slicing   their  headcount  down  dramatically  and   still  making  the  same  amount  of  money.   And  all  of  a  sudden,  a  company  that  was   producing  1  billion  in  profits  is  now   producing  two  billion  in  profits.  So,   should  their  stock  go  up?  If  they're   making  way  more  money  and  spending  less,   say,  say  they're  making  the  same  amount   of  money  but  spending  half  as  much,  then   they're  making  twice  as  much,  right?  the   efficiency  is  part  of  that.  So,  there's   probably  a  wave  of  companies  getting   these  big  pumps  off  of  these   announcements  that  they're  doing  layoffs   and  that  the  company's  going  to  be  more   profitable.  And  the  question  is,  when  do   we  hit  this  this  equilibrium  where   companies  are  going  to  suffer  because   the  economy  starts  being  unhealthy  for   the  lack  of  knowledge  workers?  That  is   the  question.  I  thought  this  was  an   amazing  chart.  Look  at  this.  Okay,   you  have  two  views  of  AI.  You  have  the   tech  singularity,  end  of  scarcity.  AI   could  end  scarcity  and  humanity  or  boost   growth  trend  by  0.2  percentage  points.   So,  it's  like  it  could  either  be  that   nothing  changes  except  that  we  get  a   slight  production  increase  or  it  could   be  that  we  extinctify  humans  or  that  we   go  to  the  moon.  This  is  the  current   state  of  AI  dialogue,  which  is  you   either  have  utopia,  dystopia,  or  nothing   ever  happens,  and  that's  about  as  much   as  anyone  really  knows  about  AI.  I  do   think  that  as  always,  there  will  be  a   ton  of  opportunities  for  humans  and  that   we  are  underestimating  the  way  that   humans  will  adapt  to  this.  That  being   said,  there  is  a  transition  period  where   if  AI  does  figure  out  how  to  unlock  way   too  much  productivity  in  the  next  year   or  two,  we  as  a  society  are  just  not   prepared  to  deal  with  that.  Because  if   there's  genuinely  not  a  need  for  all  of   these  knowledge  workers  in  really  four   years,  that's  not  something  that  our  our   economy  and  our  culture  and  our  society   is  adapted  to  deal  with.  Our  whole   society  is  built  around  people  making   the  hard  choices,  deferring   gratification,  taking  on  debt,  and   becoming  a  specialized  knowledge  worker.   And  if  all  of  those  people  start  to  not   be  able  to  afford  things,  well,  that  is   the  people  who  spend  all  the  money.  So   all  these  companies  with  amazing  stock   prices,  they're  not  going  to  last  with   those  stock  prices  if  there  isn't  this   huge  amount  of  buyers  and  sellers.  Um,  I   saw  that,  you  know,  electrician  is   probably  the  most  safe  job  over  the  next   decade  or  so.  Interesting.  If  I  was   actually  really  strapped,  I  know  this  is   a  crazy  thing  to  say.  If  I  was  broke   today  and  just  needed  to  make  money,  I   would  become  an  electrician  and  I  would   make  500k  a  year  after  my  apprenticeship   because  that's  how  much  they're   literally  making.  They're  making  250   500k  a  good  electrician  in  a  good  city.   And  then  I'd  take  as  much  excess  money   as  I  could  and  I  would  work  to  get  my   butt  in  all  of  these  private  deals.  I   would  try  to  get  and  cobble  together  um   whatever  it  needs.  I'd  beg,  borrow,  and   steal  to  get  the  accredited  status.  Not   steal  obviously,  but  you  just  work  your   butt  off  to  get  the  accredited  status   and  then  you  try  to  shovel  some  money   into  robotics  and  AI  deals.  And  I  think   you  could  probably  get  there  faster,  a   lot  of  people,  as  an  electrician  or  a   plumber,  than  most  people  would  being   like  a  social  media  intern  or  something   in  the  modern  age.  I  know  it's  a  crazy   take,  but  that's  probably  the  truth.  Is   that  blue  blue  collar  is  the  new  white   collar  in  this  crazy  new  economy.   It's  a  shitty  job,  though.  Yeah.  Well,   guess  what's  also  shitty?   Being  unemployed,  not  having  a  job.  I   actually  think  people  who  work  with   their  hands  have  a  significantly  higher   degree  of  personal  satisfaction  with   their  job.  This  is  actually  borne  out  by   the  uh  by  the  data  is  that  construction   workers  have  the  highest  job   satisfaction.  Why?  Cuz  you  you're   working  all  day,  but  then  at  the  end  you   look  up  and  you  built  a  house  and  it's   beautiful  and  you  see  that  your  hands   did  that.  And  that's  something  that  as  a   knowledge  worker,  as  like  a  computer   person,  you  just  don't  have  the  same   level  of  self  uh  self-gratification  at   the  end  of  a  job.  It's  just  the  truth.   Anyway,  um  I  wanted  to  update  a  little   bit  here  on  the  AI  movement  as  it  were.   Claude  right  now  is  pumping  out  stuff,   but  I  actually  saw  a  great  article  by   Miles.  Um  let  me  let  me  just  bring  this   up  really  quick.  Um   and  I  I  actually  agree  with  this.  I   agree  with  this.  Um,   this  is  this  is  where  we're  at.  Don't   actually  use  OpenClaw.  I  think  most   people  don't  need  OpenClaw.  I  think  if   you  want  to  build  an  autonomous  business   where  you  have  like  one  agent  managing   10  agents  that's  like  creating  copy  and   and  different  brand  images,  reaching  out   to  influencers,  negotiating  brand  deals   and  distributing  product.  You're  trying   to  you're  trying  to  automate  all  that.   Yeah,  you  open  claw  start  to  build   stuff.  But  if  you  just  want  someone  to   automate  your  daily  tasks,  to  do  some   research,  to  write  scripts  like  in  my   case,  uh  to  send  you  know  invoices,  to   do  the  sort  of  basic  blocking  and   tackling  of  daily  work  tasks,  I  I  don't   think  you  need  it.  And  that's  because  uh   these  SAS  companies  like  where  is  it?   Where  is  it?  Where  to  go?  These  SAS   companies  like   Powork  or  Claude  are  actually  being   integrated  into  notion  and  they're  also   being  integrated  into  Cowwork  for  things   like  Excel.  And  you  probably  just  don't   need  to  deal  with  the  overhead  of   running  an  agent  having  its  own   specialized  machine  locally.  Most  people   would  be  fine  just  using  the  built-in  AI   tooling  that's  coming  to  a  lot  of  these   big  organizations.  I  think  the  open  claw   hype  was  mind-blowing  and  that  it  moved   the  industry  forward,  but  I  don't  think   that  it's  actually  the  right  fit  for   most  people.  I'll  say  this,  almost   everything  that  I  built  with  my  open   claw  has  broken  and  has  become  tangled   Christmas  tree  lights  as  I've  tried  to   expand  it.  So,  I'm  hitting  my  own   personal  plateaus  with  the  vibe  coding   stuff.  It  was  amazing  for  a  bit,  but  now   I'm  personally  struggling  to  get  stuff   to  work  at  scale.  And  I'm  probably  just   going  to  default  back  to  Notion  AI  and   Slack  AI  and,  you  know,  co-work  and  just   using  the  stuff  that's  built  into  the   box  because  I  don't  even  have  to  mess   with  all  that  overhead.  I  don't  have  to   spend  thousands  of  dollars  a  month  in   credits.  I  can  just  use  the  features  I   need,  do  the  research  I  need,  automate   the  single  tasks  I  need,  and  not  have   the  headache.  So,  that's  kind  of  my  my   take  right  now  on  Open  AI  or  the  AI   movement  is  that  the  open  claw  thing  has   been  overcooked.  Um,  and  my  take  on  the   market  with  Jane  Street  is  is  really   this.  I  think  this  is  a  great  one.  Make   them  think  Jane  Street  marked  the   bottom,  then  retrace  the  entire  pump  and   nuke  it  to  50K.  Again,  I  don't  know  if   they're  going to  nuke  to  50K,  though.   That  is  the  next  big  level,  right?  You   can  see  here  uh  we  have  this  60k  bottom   but  really  the  big  big  level  here  is   from  the   just  look  at  the  monthly  uh  this  is  the   big  level  from   what  was  this  August  of  2024.  So  this   49k  that  was  the  bullet  that  was  when   Trump  caught  the  bullet  and  that  to  me   is  the  biggest  level  on  the  chart.  So   that's  the  next  big  big  level  to  me.  All   of  this  is  just  chop  in  between,  but  60K   isn't  like  super  hard  uh  support.  I   mean,  maybe  it'll  prove  out  to  be,  who   knows?  But  um  again,  uh  from  a  TA   perspective,  from  a  simple  chart   perspective,  uh  this  is  the  next  really   big  level  is  that  49K.  So,  if  we  do  lose   60K,  I  would  not  be  surprised  to  see  us   take  a  trip  down  there.  Not  to  be  the   bearer  of  bad  news,  but  I  just  want  you   guys  to  have  a  realistic  understanding.   And  finally,   if  you  are  looking  to  buy  a  house  in   2026,  absolutely  do  not  because  the   houses  are  so  insanely  overpriced.   Everybody  knows  it.  Nobody  wants  them.   And  this  is  the  time  that  truth  and   light  and  reality  set  in  for  the  boomers   because  things  have  changed.  I  text  my   mom  this  this  actual  Google  searches  for   can't  sell  a  house  just  at  alltime  high.   I  live  in  LA.  the  most  illogical  and   overpriced  housing  district  in  America.   She  texted  me  back,  \"Yes,  but  reality   doesn't  ever  apply  to  LA  and   specifically  the  good  neighborhoods  in   LA.\"  And  I  said,  \"Not  this  time.  This   time  is  different  because  remote  work   killed  the  need  to  be  near  the  office.   People  don't  drink.  There's  no  reason  to   be  close  to  the  clubs  and  the  nightife.\"   Okay,  the  entire  knowledge  worker  space   is  under  heat,  is  under  fire.  Hollywood   is  dying  because  of  AI  and  sea  dance  and   these  AI  produced  uh  content.  Nobody   goes  to  the  movies.  Why  oh  why  would  LA   be  immune  to  any  kind  of  true  housing   selloff?  I  don't  buy  it.  I  think  that   this  is  the  first  time  that  LA  gets   completely  destroyed  when  the  rest  of   the  market  drops.  I'm  calling  it  now.  I   think  that  this  is  for  sure  the  time   that  LA  sees  reality.  And  I  saw  I  think   as  a  as  a  testament  to  this,  there  was   this  story  that  an  AI  bot  spam  uh  AI   spam  bot  uh  started  hitting  up  all  these   home  sellers  in  Tampa.  Uh  where  was   this?  I  think  this  is  it.  Uh  so  this  guy   set  up  his  open  claw  to  send  lowball   offers  on  Zillow  all  day  just  to  make   boomers  start  panicking.  And  they  said   they've  gotten  zero  positive  responses,   270  negative  responses.  one  was  violent   and  they  reported  to  the  Tampa  Bay   Police  Department  um  with  102   non-responses.  So,  they  got  270   responses  and  102  non-responses,  which   is  absolutely  insane  to  be  batting.   That's  nearly  3/4,  right?  That's  nearly   75%  are  responding  and  all  negative  cuz   he's  doing  70%  below  asking.  So,  imagine   you  have  a  $5  million  house.  He's   offering  them  $1.5  million,  which  is,  if   you're  thinking  of  this  as  a  seller,   unthinkable,  right?  Unthinkable.  So,  to   me,  I  think  that's  where  it's  at,   though.  If  I  saw  a  lot  of the  houses  in   LA,  I  would  pay  for  for  what  they're   asking.  $5  million.  Yeah,  I'd  pay  I  pay   1.5  million  for  sure  all  day.  But  the  $5   million  doesn't  even  feel  like  a  nice  h.   It  doesn't  feel  like  a  finished  house  in   LA.  Look  up  LA  houses  for  $5  million.   You  will  be  shocked.  You  will  be  shocked   as  to  what  you  get,  which  feels  like  not   a  lot.  Feels  like  not  a  lot.  Certainly   not  like  the  dream  house  you'd  imagine   for  five  million  bucks.  So,  um,  if  we  do   see  a  70%,  uh,  correction  in  LA  real   estate,  I'm  happy.  I'm  happy.  I  I'll   live  in  the  sunshine,  baby.  Don't  get  me   wrong.  But  for  right  now,  I'm  calling   it.  We've  seen  the  top.  We've  seen  the   top  on  residential  housing  at  least  for   a  few  years.  If  not,  potentially  in  our   lifetimes,  depending  on  how  much  they   print  money,  of  course,  they  print  a  ton   of  money,  then  everything  will  rerate.   But  at  least,  I  think  for  the  2020s,   we've  seen  the  top.   Another  absolutely  hot  take.  Sales  are  a   skill  that  is  getting  more  valuable   because  the  truth  is  that  as  much  as  the   math  and  science  people  will  probably   put  out  of  work.  You  don't  need  need  to   know  how  to  code.  You  don't  need  to  know   how  to  do  math.  You  don't  need  to  know   how  to  do  a  lot  of  these  sciences   though.  The  hard  sciences,  the   mechanical  engineering  stuff,  you  will   probably  need  some  more  support  there.   And  as  the  guy  from  Anderel  Jackson   Lucky  said,  I  think  the  people  who  are   not  computer  savvy  will  be  able  to  build   little  mechanical  things  and  plug  in   vibecoded  brains  into  them  and  they'll   be  able  to  make  incredible  things.   Incredible  things.  So  I  do  think  the   shape  rotators,  the  mechanical  engineers   will  benefit.  But  I  also  think  that  the   salespeople,  the  content  creators,  the   humans  that  actually  make  people  feel   alive  and  communicate  well  will  continue   to  have  an  incredible  role.  So,  I  think   that  that  is  going  to  accelerate.  I   think  that  AI  will  make  it  easier  for   those  people  to  amplify  their  messages,   but  I  don't  think  that  the  human  touch   is  at  least  in  my  lifetime  going  to   disappear  with  its  relevance.  People   like  to  interact  with  humans  and  they   probably  always  will.  So,  it's  going  to   be  interesting.  But  I  do  think  at least   for  the  next  10  years,  I  don't  think   that  humanbased  sales  and  interactions   and  interpersonal  connections  are  going   to  go  down.  I  think  they  will  actually   be  considered  more  valuable  especially   as  the  need  for  the  hard  scientific   background  drops  and  the  the  need  for   other  types  of  knowledge  work  drops.   You'll  get  generalists  that  have  passion   are  extremely  stubborn,  extremely  driven   and  I  think  they'll  be  very  very   successful   as  an  engineer.  I  feel  things  like  a   mechanic  will  be  easily  replaced.  Maybe   maybe  is  a  certified  investor.  How  much   do  you  need  to  to  lose  to  get  Yeah,  I'm   a  certified  investor.  A  certified   investor  in  in  things  that  go  down.  Um   got  a  good  till  canceled  at   approximately  55k  6  months  and  it   automatically  cancelled  which  covers  in   May.  You  talking  about  a  limit  order  to   buy  Bitcoin?   Yeah,  I  mean  that's  fine.  My  openclaw   just  got  a  new  mission.  Thanks  Elio.   What  did  you  What's  the  mission,   brother?  What's  the  mission?  Yeah,   California's  terrible.  It's  terrible,   right?  The  policies  are  crazy.  But,  uh,   there  is  there's  a  change  happening.  Uh,   supposedly  there's  a  Republican  governor   in  the  front  running  for  California   governor.  And  people  are  waking  up.   People  are  waking  up  to  the  fact  that   you  can't  just  blindly  slap  a,  you  know,   Democratic  label  on  everything  and   assume  that  it's  good.  They  understand   that  the  policies  of  the  last  few  years   haven't  been  working  out.  And  let's  be   honest,  it's  the  best  weather,  most   beautiful  state  in  the  country.  You   might  not  not  agree  with  that,  but   that's  what  the  facts  are.  I  mean,   pretty  much  universally  agree  that  the   weather  in  California  is  the  best  in  the   country.  Uh,  and  that's  what  keeps   people  here  is  it's  a  beautiful  place  to   be.  Uh,  it's  definitely  worth  a  premium,   but  not  the  premium  that's  currently   being  charged.  I  think  that  we'll  see  a   return  back  to  sanity  here.  And  then  I'm   okay  with  paying  a  little  extra  to  live   in  California.  I  just  don't  want  to  get   dinged  completely  um,  and  have  to  deal   with,  you  know,  hurricanes  and  floods   and  snowstorms  and  all  these  other   things  that  you  have  to  deal  with  in   different  uh,  different  jurisdictions.   California.  Yeah,  you  get  an  earthquake   once  every  never.  Um,  but  other  than   that,  it's  just  beautiful.  It's  just   beautiful.  It's  just  the  truth.  It's   it's  a  beautiful  place.  Best  weather  on   earth.  Yeah.  I  mean,  it  just  it  is  it's   just  nice.  You  know,  my  family's  here,   too.  Like  close  to  my  parents.  Family's   really  important  to  me.  Um,  and  so,   everyone  has  their  reasons  for  being   where  they  are.  For  me,  I  almost  think   of  it  as,  you  know,  maybe  California   just  needs  better  leadership.  Maybe  it   needs  more  voices,  young  voices  who   understand  how  to  uh  make  the  place   better.  Because  I  think  a  lot  of  people   have  the  same  goals.  That's  the  thing  is   when  you  get  caught  up  in  politics,  you   forget  that  everyone  really  has  the  same   goals.  People  want  life  to  be  easier.   They  want  to  afford  more  stuff.  They   want  their  kids  to  do  well.  They  want   safety.  99%  of  what  people  want  is  the   same.  They  just  believe  and  have  been   taught  to  believe  that  the  way  the  other   people  want  to  do  it  is  evil.  Um,  and  so   if  you  can  unite  people  around  a  sane   agenda,  I  think  that's  the  that's  the   right  path  forward.  Of  course,  politics   is  just  so  so  toxic  now,  as  you  know.  I   I'm  sure  I'll  get  some  toxic  comments   under  this  when  all  I  said  was,  \"Let's   be  sane.\"  Um,  but  that's  that's  just   what  it  is.  I'm  sure  you  guys  have  seen   the  drift.  The  drift  is  crazy.  Um,  but   anyway,  uh,  what  else  do  we  have  here?  I   think  we've  gotten  we've  gotten   everything,  but  let's  uh  let's  check   this  out.  This  is  This  is  good.  This  is   fun.  This  is  fun.  Let's  do  this.   By  2030,  almost  80%  of  people  um  had   lost  their  jobs.  They  had  no  money,  no   purpose.  But  they   >> How  good  is  that?  Look  at  this.  Besos.   I  feel  like  he's  on  track  for  this  with   he's  been  partying  with  his  girl  in   Miami  and  stuff  like  this  is  where  he's   headed.  This  is  what  we  always  wanted   for  you,  Jeff.   >> No  purpose,  but  they  had  a  lot  of  time   on  their  hands.  The  less  people  actually   did  physical  work,  the  more  they  wanted   to  appear  as  if  they  did.   >> What  if  we  could  use  the  energy  of   humans  to  power  the  machines  that   >> this  is  like  uh  the  the  AI  version  of   the  matrix.  This  is  like  our  new  version   of  the  office  meets  the  matrix  cuz   everyone  I  think  this  is  like  a  profound   observation.  Uh  the  less  work  people  do,   the  more  they  want  to  appear  as  if  they   did.  I  mean  it's  true  like  we're  all   just  showing  off  our  bodies.  Most  people   in  the  gym  don't  actually  uh  do  hard   labor  or  anything  like  that.  Um,   >> Energy  solved  our  need  for  energy  and   your  need   for  purpose.   I  love  how  they  made  every  one  of  the   founders  fat  as  if  they  never  ever  ever   go  to  the  inner  gym  themselves.  Anyway,   I  thought  that  would  be  a  funny  way  to   end  it.   Class  action  lawsuit  against  Jane   Street.  Let's  do  it,  brother.  Let's  do   it.  You  and  me.  Let's  go.  Let's  get   them.   How  much  did  I  lose?  100  mil  or  300   million?  No,  the  100  million  uh  that  I   lost  that  I  said  I  lost  at  the  end  of   last  year,  you  know,  a  lot  of  that  was   uh  tokens  I  had  invested  in  early  uh   token  that  I  started  like  super,  as  you   guys  know,  I've  never  sold  any  of  my   founder  tokens  in  Super.  And  Super  was   trading  at  2  and  a  half  billion  FTV.  So,   you  guys  have  to  just  use  your  brain,   you  know,  like  I  two  and  a  half  billion   FTV  for  the  founder  stake  is  going to  be   a  lot.  It's  going  to  be  a  lot.  Um,  and  I   just  didn't  sell  any  because  I  felt  like   it  wasn't  ready.  I  felt  like  the  project   hadn't  matured.  We  were  just  on  our  way   to  do  something  and  Trump  was  taking   over.  I  felt  like,  yeah,  it'll  be  ready   in  the  next  few  months  or  years,  but,   you  know,  it  just  never  reached  the   escape  velocity.  So,  most  people  sell   within,  you  know,  a  few  minutes  of   starting  a  project.  And  it's  been  over   six  years  now  since  I've  started  working   on  Super,  which  I  funded  out  of  my  own   pocket,  the  initial  development,  uh,   while  I  was  living  very,  very  cheaply.   So,  yeah,  I  mean,  I  don't  have  any  big   backers.  I  never  got  an  easy  way  into   this  and  I  never  took  any  of  the  the   obvious  offroads  and  paydays.  I've  just   been  trying  to  build  something   sustainable  for  the  audience.  So,  you   know,  whatever.  I  just  think  that  over   time  we'll  win.  Keep  running  our  head   against  the  wall.  The  wall  will  fall  and   I'm  excited  for  it.  But,  um,  but  no,  I   mean,  last  year  was  was  horrific.  It  was   definitely  horrific  performance.  I've   had  a  much  better  year  already  in  2026   because  I  stopped  just  using  as  a  lens.   I  stopped  just  assuming  things  will  go   up  because  I  want  them  to  go  up  and  I   started  using  an  objective  system.  So,  I   really  just  want  to  shout  out  again   Brandon  uh  helped  helped  me  learn  his   system  and  I've  learned  a  lot  through   him.  So,  check  him  out.  I  I  definitely   share  his  perspective.  You  should   actively  trade  when  things  are  trending   only  when  things  are  trending.  You   shouldn't  just  be  trading  to  trade,  but   when  things  are  trending,  push  the  chip   center,  ride  the  trend,  and  then  as  far   as  the  real  altcoins  for  right  now,  I   think  those  are  in  private  markets.  And   then  once  we  get  alignment  through  the   clarity  act,  we  can  see  e  equity-like   structures  hitting  the  token  sphere   which  will  lead  to  tokens  that  have  the   type  of  performance  that  we  expected  out   of  the  Ethereum  killers,  out  of  the   Solana  killers,  out  of  the  DeFi  gems.   There's  too  much  leakage  in  the  token   ecosystem  between  the  token  itself,  the   labs  company,  the  foundation,  the   investors.  like  there's  too  many  ways   for  people  to  get  access  to  the  value   going  on  there  without  it  being  directly   through  being  a  token  holder.  So  once   that  gets  fixed  through  the  clarity  act,   we  will  see  an  improvement  in  crypto  and   there  will  be  tokens  that  rightfully  so   start  to  have  massive  massive  price   performance  and  that  will  be  the  change   and  we  don't  need  to  frontr  run  that.  We   don't  I  think  that  that's  the  thing  that   I  misunderstood  last  time  is  that  you   don't  need  to  die  on  the  stake  waiting   for  this  to  happen.  We  can  simply   observe  the  trend  and  as  it  flips   bullish  we  can  buy  into  that  bullish   trend  and  ride  it  and  then  as  it  breaks   we  should  be  aware  that  that  would  be   the  time  to  be  taking  risk  off.  And  if   we  had  done  that  in  2023  and  24,  we   would  have  sold  at  the  top  of  the  ETF  uh   high  that  we  saw  when  the  market  started   pretty  obviously  rolling  over,  even   though  we  didn't  want  it  to.  And  we   would  have  sold  again  at  124,000  when  we   had  that  swing  failure  pattern  in   October.  We  would  have  been  much  more   profitable.  And  that's  my  goal  for  the   next  cycle  is  that  we  rode  up  all  the   bullish  trends.  We  just  didn't  identify   the  bare  trends  because  I  wasn't  using   the  objective  system  that  I  am  now.  And   that's  going  to  change.  And  so  nothing   left  to  do  but  just  to  take  my  licks  and   to  rebuild.  Obviously  the  channel  is  not   as  big  as  it  was  as  um  as  when  we  were   getting  things  more  right,  but  we  will   be  back  again.  I've  been  through  a  few   bare  bare  market  cycles  and  I've  built   things  back  up  before  and  what  I  know   for  sure  is  that  if  I  keep  honoring  the   commitment  to  the  audience  here  that   nothing  can  stop  us.  You  know,   eventually  there's  going  to  be  a  bull   market.  We're  going  to  ride  it.  We're   going  to  make  out  like  bandits  and  then   we're  going  to  roll  those  profits  into   even  better  investments  and  we're  going   to  continue  to  compound  because  the   world  is  very  infinite.  Think  about  it   like  this.  If  AI  speeds  up  the  process   to  make  a  successful  business  and  crypto   speeds  up  the  process  to  give  access  to   those  successful  businesses  to   investors,  then  there  is  very  much  so  a   reality  in  which  we  will  see  the   opportunity  to  invest  in  rapidly  growing   businesses  accelerate  and  the  amount  of   opportunities  will  become  numerous.  And   sure,  there  will  be  more  companies  and   things  will  grow  and  die  faster,  but   those  types  of  opportunities  will  be   life-changing  if  you're  able  to  identify   it.  and  we're  going  to  be  there  on  the   ground  floor.  It's  actually  insane  how   far  ahead  we  are  as  far  as  information   asymmetry.  When  you  talk  to  normal   people  in  the  normal  world,  I  was  just   on  a  college  campus.  I  drove  to  college   campuses  in  LA  and  I  wanted  to  ask   college  kids  like,  \"Are  you  scared  about   AI  taking  your  jobs?\"  And  let  me  tell   you  this,  they  had  no  idea  what  AI  is   even  doing  right  now.  They  are  all   cheating  on  their  tests  with  it,  but   they  have  no  idea  what  AI  can  do.  and   they  have  no  idea  what  awaits  them  on   the  other  side  of  this.  And  I  thought   college  students  would  be  freaking  out,   absolutely  losing  it,  pulling  their  hair   out.  Not  the  case.  Not  the  case.  Most   college  students  are  not  even  scared  at   all  about  what's  happening  with  AI.  So   it  really  puts  in  perspective  that   there's  a  small  group  of  people  on  the   very  bleeding  edge  of  information,   mostly  on  X,  mostly  on  YouTube.  They're   investors  and  they're  thinking  deeply   about  the  implications  of  everything   happening  right  now.  But  we  are  this   tiny  tiny  fraction  of  the  universe.  This   is  not  something  that  everybody's   talking  about.  Most  people  have  no  clue.   They  have  no  plan.  And  we  will  be  ahead   of  not  just  90%,  not  just  95%  but  99.5   99.9%  of  people.  We  will  be  ahead  of   them  with  this  process.  I'm  excited  for   that.   College  students  are  partying.  I  hope   they  are,  man.  I  hope  they  are.  I  miss   those  days.  Am  I  still  in  karate?  No,   brother.  No.   always  enjoy  your  vids.  You're  a  cool   dude.  Thank  you,  brother.   Yeah.  Look,  I  mean,  as  scary  as  right   now  is,  you  just  have  to  realize  there's   so  much  opportunity.  It's  insane.   There's  so  much  opportunity.  And  you   could  either  wallow  over  the  things  that   happened  in  the  past  that  spilled  milk.   Or  you  could  realize  that  we  are   probably  looking  at  the  birth  of  the   most  profitable,  most  important   companies  in  the  history  of  our  society   and  that  in  future  generations,  they   will  look  back  on  what's  happening  as   cavemanlike.  They  will  look  back  at  us,   great  grandpa,  if  you  are  so  lucky  as  to   have  kids,  I  highly  encourage  it.  I'm   excited  to  have  my  own  kids.  And  they   will  say,  \"I  can't  believe  you  lived   without  AI.  You  just  took  vitamins.  You   didn't  know  your  blood  vitals  at  all   times.  You  didn't  have  someone   protecting  your  house.  You  didn't  have  a   robot  protecting  your  house  and  kids  at   all  times.  You  didn't  have  like  this   sane  knowledge  that  everything  was  just   going  to  be  okay  cuz  the  robots  made   sure  of  it.  They  will  look  back  at  this   moment  as  absolutely  insane  and   unthinkable.  Like  we  look  back  at  people   before  the  invention  of,  you  know,   antibiotics  and  soap.  We  go,  \"Oh  my  god,   you  stub  your  toe  and  that's  it.  That's   it.  You're  cooked  for  life.  One  toe   stub,  one  paper  cut,  that's  it,   brother.\"  And  um  and  we  think  of  that  as   archaic,  but  we  can't  have  the   perspective  to  realize  that  probably  in   a  few  generations,  as  scary  as  all  this   is,  they'll  look  back  and  go,  \"Can  you   believe  those  cavemen  lived  without   robots  doing  everything  for  them?\"   Absolutely  insane.  So  keep  your  heads   up.  Keep  your  keep  an  optimistic  lens.   Things  are  probably  going  to  get  a  lot   better  regardless  of  the  dumerism.  And   there's  an  opportunity  for  you  to  join   the  permanent  upper  class  by  being  early   in  some  of  these  deals  and  by   recognizing  that  there  is  an  altcoin   bull  run.  It's  just  not  here  in  crypto   today.  And  we  should  be  looking  at  these   new  altcoins.  That's  my  perspective.  And   we  should  be  maximizing  the  amount  of   money  we  can  make  by  riding  trends,   which  currently  nothing's  really   trending.  Like  gold's  not  trending,   Bitcoin's  not  trending,  everything's   just  chop  suie  sideways.  It's  okay  to   wait  and  just  reevaluate.  Um,  but  we'll   be  doing  more  on  sort  of  current  2026   investing,  the  cycles  and  all  this.  But   I  just  want  you  guys  to  understand  like   there  are  bull  runs  almost  always  in   different  places.  And  right  now,  the  big   bull  run  is  happening  in  private   markets.  I  don't  think  it's  going  to   stop  either  because  the  demand  is   insatiable.  The  demand  is  insatiable  for   disruptive  AI  and  robotics  companies.  It   is  insatiable  and  the  total  address  of   the  TAM  the  total  addressable  market  is   monstrous.   People  are  now  working  paycheck  to   paycheck  hoping  their  farms  are  okay,   their  fam  okay.  Yeah,  I  mean  you   absolutely  should.  Like  I  said,  things   aren't  easy.  I'm  not  here  to  say,  \"Oh,   here's  an  easy  pill.\"  I  think  investing   in  crypto  in  20h  2018  and  19,  that  was   the  easy  pill.  Um,  it's  not  been  the   easy  pill  over  the  last  few  years,  and   there  is  maybe  no  easy  pill,  but  there   is  an  obvious  path,  which  is  if  you   maximize  your  active  income,  which   everyone  should  be  right  now,  maximize   your  active  income  and  understand  that   there  are  ways  to  magnify  many  ex's  what   your  capital  has  and  can  offer  in  risky   opportunities.  It's  just  not  all  coins   right  now.  It  might  be  all  coins  again   in  2027.  I  think  if  we  pass  the  Clarity   Act,  then  we  see  some  massive  changes   here.  We  will  see  some  altcoins  start  to   thrive.  I  think  the  Clarity  Act  will  be   that  thing.  Um,  but  it's  also  important   to  realize  like  we're  seeing  the  bare   narrative  accelerate.  Now,  it  feels  like   kind  of  the  mid  cycle  for  the  bare   market  where  people  are  like,  \"Oh,  it   can't  go  lower.\"  But  then  there's  a  new   bare  narrative  and  a  new  bear  narrative   and  and  that's  just  kind  of  how  markets   are.  They  find  narrative  to  explain  the   price  after  the  fact.  But  what's  going   to  happen  to  the  people  who  are  not   getting  overly  lost  in  the  sauce  is  that   there  will  be  opportunities  to  invest   throughout  this.  And  again,  if  you  guys   are  interested  in  that,  if  especially  if   you're  inredit  accredited,  just  uh  stay   stay  watching  this  space.  And  I'd  like   to  figure  out  ways  that  we  can  all  work   to  get  bigger  access  to  these  deals.   Usually  having  a  bigger  group  of  people   helps.  Um,  and  yeah,  hopefully  we  can   navigate  this  next  few  years  of   investing  and  make  an  insane  amount  of   money  together  because  that's  been   always  been  the  goal  of  this  channel  is   to  make  money.  I  know  that's  why  you   guys  are  here.   Yeah,  sure.  Short  squeeze  to  80K,   whatever.  Below  80K,  like  I  said,  keep   it  simple,  right?  Below  80K,  we're  still   bearish,  right?  I  I  brought  this  up  to   you  guys  several  times.  I  I  actually   been  showing  this  since  we  since  we   first  lost  72K.   Actually,  before  we  lost  72K,  I  said   below  that  number  is  49.  So,  all  of  this   is  Let  me  just  get  rid  of  Let  me  just   get  rid  of  this.  Put  this  a  little  more   opaque.  Right.  This  is  the  range  is  you   have   this  yellow  to  this  yellow.  That's  the   range.  And  we're  in  the  middle  of  it   really.  I  mean,  I  I  have  these  drawings   here.  They're  a  little  bit  confusing.   Let  me  get  them  out  of  the  way.  But  we   shouldn't  even  be  thinking  about   anything  bullish  unless  we  get  up  into   up  into  this  zone.  And  even  then,  it   could  easily  go  up  here  and  then  reject   because  this  was  the  real  breakdown   point.  You  know,  this  was  the  real  where   the  bare  trend  uh  accelerated.  So,  let's   just  take  it  level  by  level.  That's   that's  the  objective  way  to  do  this  is   to  say,  okay,  if  things  are  so  bullish,   then  where  are  the  buyers?  If  things  are   bullish,  really  bullish,  buyers  start   buying.  Just  remember  that  you  don't   need  to  know  everything  about  the  news.   It's  too  noisy.  It's  too  noisy.  It's  fun   to  talk  about,  but  it's  too  noisy.  You   need  an  objective  system  when  it  comes   to  buying  and  selling.  And  when  you  have   that  dialed  in,  which  is  the  point  of   this  channel  in  2026,  acknowledge  here's   where  we  lost,  why  did  we  lose,  how  can   we  change  it?  If  you  don't  do  that,  then   I  don't  know.  I  think  there's  going  to   be a  lot  of  crypto  channels  that   completely  die  because  they  are  unable   to  update  the  thesis.  And  um  I  just   don't  want  to  do  that.  I  want  to  be  the   best  investor  I  can  be  and  I  want  to   make  the  most  money  I  can  make  and  I   also  am  hoping  I  can  do  this  in  a  way   where  it  is  100%  aligned  with  the   channel.  So  that's  my  goal.  Um  hopefully   we  can  achieve  greatness  this  year.  And   even  though  everyone's  calling  this  year   off  as  a  bare  market,  if  the  market  gets   to  a  place  where  there's  an  amazing   short  opportunity,  I'll  cover  it.  And   you  know,  I  made  a  a  great  amount  of   money  shorting  over  the  last  few  weeks.   um  it's  too  advanced  for  me  to  cover  on   daily  YouTube  videos,  but  as  I  get   better,  as  I  feel  more  confident,  I'll   share  them  with  you.  Um  so,  we're  going   to  make  money  on  whether  the  market's   trending  up  or  down,  and  then  we're   going to  find  the  best  long-term  uh   investment  opportunities,  which  I  think   right  now  are  in  private  markets.  I'm   going  to  a  actual  um  really  cool  event   tonight.  I  will  let  you  guys  know  a   little  bit  about  it  hopefully  over  the   next  week  or  so.  and  I'm  going  to  try  to   just  expand  the  focus  and  expand  what   we're  doing  here  so  that  I  can  be  the   most  useful.  Um,  which  I  think  at  I   think  at  a  certain  time  explaining   altcoins  was  the  most  useful  thing  I   could  do.  Now  I  think  getting  into  the   more  deep  tech  trending  investments  and   also  learning  more  about  how  to  share   viable  active  trading  systems,  not  just   like  hey  then  when  you  combine  these   seven  indicators  you  get  a  100%  buy  and   sell  signal.  It's  like  that  doesn't   work.  you  want  to  use  simple  trading   systems.  Um,  and  I  know  this  because  I   spent  the  last  five  months  working  on  it   and  I  made  the  trading  system  work  for   me.  Um,  so  I'm  excited  for  it.  Uh,  I'm   very  very  thankful  just  to  even  be   continuing  to  have  this  community.  So,   thank  you  guys  for  showing  up  and  I  will   see  you  very  soon  on  the  next  episode,   guys.  See  you  very  soon.  All  right,  take   care.",

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin árát manipuláló Jane Street vállalat elleni vádak újra napirendre kerültek a Donald Trump médiaszervezete által benyújtott pernyújtás miatt. A beszélgetés középpontjában áll, hogy vajon valóban létezhet-e olyan boogeyman, mint Jane Street, amely felelős a Bitcoin és a kriptovaluták árának csökkenéséért. Az ügyvéd által tett kijelentések és a korábbi piaci események elemzése alapján rövid távú hatásokkal kell számolni a piacon. Eddig a Bitcoin árának emelkedése nem tükrözi a bírósági eljárás által hozott megtorlásokat, és a közelmúlt alacsony volatilitása azt jelzi, hogy a vádlottak esetleg nem szenvednek komoly következményekkel. Augusztusig a Bitcoin piaca valószínűleg továbbra is ingatag marad. A közép- és hosszú távú előrejelzések azonban pozitív elmozdulásokat láthatnak a bírósági döntések alapján, amennyiben létrejön a szabályozói átláthatóság a kriptoiparban.",
    "summary_en": "The allegations against Jane Street, accused of manipulating Bitcoin's price, have resurfaced due to a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump's media company. The discussion revolves around whether such a boogeyman exists that is responsible for the declines in Bitcoin and crypto prices. Based on the lawyer's statements and analysis of previous market events, short-term impacts on the market are expected. To date, Bitcoin's price increase does not reflect the courtroom ramifications, and the recent low volatility suggests the defendants may not face serious consequences. The Bitcoin market is likely to remain volatile until August. However, medium- to long-term forecasts could see positive shifts based on court rulings, provided regulatory clarity is established in the crypto sector.",
