        "transcript": "We're about to watch two different CEOs describe the same robo taxi future. Rivian is attempting to build the technology from scratch while Uber is trying to build the network that connects it all. But the main takeaway here is that self-driving cars are no longer just a science experiment. They are becoming a very real business. >> We're building technology to enable very high levels of self-driving. That means the hardware platform, the data architecture, the data flywheel to train this this u foundation model for driving. And this is something we're very convicted in. I've said many times this is where we're spending a very significant part of our R&D dollars towards self-driving towards autonomy. It's our biggest spend category. And we're very bullish on what we're building. And so what we're demonstrating today with with the vehicles is showing just the one of the first steps. It's a pointto-point full self-driving capability. Um but that's only going to grow over time. you are making this primarily for the people who buy Rivian so they can use the uh artificial intelligence self-driving technology on their own but you kind of open the door on stage to the possibility of pursuing ride share opportunities would you consider your own robo taxi service >> so you know from a technology point of view if you can deliver level four autonomy so that's with the vehicle where it can drive empty meaning no one in the driver's seat completely operating itself that can go towards a personal level four vehicle it can go towards a robo tax or ride share uh level four vehicle. It's it's very much the same technology. And for us, our initial focus is on personal level 4. You around 99% of the miles driven the United States are in personally owned vehicles. It's not to say we don't think the ride share space is interesting. It's just to say that our initial focus is personal. But we're absolutely open to and we'll be exploring ways we can deploy it in the ride share space. >> Real quick, Kelly, I know you have a question, but I want to button this up because people will listen to this and they'll say, \"Are you talking with other companies about pursuing a robo taxi strategy?\" >> Today, we're focused on the technology. We're focused on making sure we have a really clear road map and a rapid road map to level four. Uh, you know, between here and level four, we have what we call eyes off. That's a level three capability. You can be in the car in the driver's seat, but on your phone reading a book, not actively involved in driving the vehicle. But the next major step beyond that is level four. The vehicle can pick your kids up from school, drop you at the airport, or as you said, enable other business models like a robo taxi or ride shares. >> Early this year, you also put out a statement on on the robo taxi push as well. and and so the Middle East and and Asia were the markets for 2025 to launch and we've seen of course that initial deployment in the Middle East already. >> What's happening on the Asia side? >> Well, uh lots of discussions on the Asia side. Uh I think what's really important is to set up a regulatory framework >> uh to go forward. Uh for example, Hong Kong has various trials and pilots going on and in many other markets. were talking to regulators about how we can be a part of shaping ride share and autonomous rid share going forward. The technology is absolutely getting there. Uh these are the robot driver doesn't get tired, doesn't get distracted. Uh and we very much look forward to working with various authorities to introduce ride share into the markets every major market in which we operate. uh we are having discussions with autonomous partners and then most importantly regulators as to how we can introduce autonomous either in a pilot way or in within some restricted operational domain. You know everyone wants this product. It's a product that's delightful in markets for example in Atlanta in Austin and Abu Dhabi. Our consumers love the product. They feel safe. uh and this technology is hitting prime time now and every major city in the world wants to be a part of that revolution. >> Let's talk about the US as well because you're partnering there with with Whimo as well in certain cities. >> Terrific partner. >> Yeah, terrific partner actually in the latest earnings I think you said excellent as well. But uh in some places Whimo is expanding into new cities without you and becoming a direct competitor and that's something that was highlighted even by by Wed Bush early this week as being a potential risk uh for your business next year. How you assessing that? >> Well, I think it's it's uh the same example that I gave you that in some ways the McDonald's app is a competitor to Uber Eats >> uh and the two can coexist and it's very very early in the development of autonomous. We have to make sure that we have access to autonomous technology in the major cities that have the right regulatory frameworks to allow autonomous. And we're very confident as we look at our roadmap and we look at our partners. We have over 20 partners, autonomous partners globally that we will have access to autonomous technologies in the large cities and markets uh that really count. When you say access to 20 different partners, do you think that that is the way that the industry will continue to evolve or do you expect consolidation on on the robo taxi side as well or the autonomous driving software side? >> What we're seeing is this is a trillion dollar plus market uh in terms of autonomous uh mobility. I think delivery eventually will be of a similar size. And when you have markets that are that large, you usually don't have winner take alls. It's the same way with these uh uh LLM models. there are many to choose from whether it's an open AI or Gemini and I think the same will be true of autonomous uh it's an exciting technology but there are many players getting to the finish line we just have to make sure that uh the players that we work with are safe uh and that again we're working with the regulators in a constructive manner >> both Rivian and Uber are signaling a major shift the industry is now moving beyond the testing phase and is now fully focused on commercialization and profit ability of autonomous driving. In the first interview, the Rivian CEO admits that self-driving is now their biggest spending category, and they are now building their own custom chips to power it. On the other side, Uber CEO is expanding into new markets like the Middle East and Asia, and he's partnering with over 20 different companies instead of betting on just one. Are you confused or want to know more about how an AI can make a car drive? Don't worry, I built a course that answers this and many more questions about AI. It breaks down the essentials and covers things like compute and hardware and how AI actually works in the real world, all in a step-by-step process that's easy to understand. Once you buy, you get lifetime access, and because the course expands over time, the price will also go up over time. So, now is the best time to join. Check out the link in the description. Now, back to the video. This is really about building the infrastructure. For the last few years, companies spent billions just trying to get a car to drive safely around a block. Now, they are spending money to build the business behind the autonomous car. Rivian is trying to become a software company. They realize that in the future, the profit won't just come from selling the truck, but from selling the subscription that lets the truck drive itself. Uber is playing a different game. They know they can't build a better robot than the car companies. So, they're building the app store for rides. Their attempt is to partner with virtually everyone. Although I think they might struggle with Tesla, but their attempt is that Uber ensures that no matter who makes the best robot car, you still have to open the Uber app to hail it. The shift creates a totally new concept for the car itself. If the car drives itself, it stops being a machine for driving and starts being a room for living. This opens up a huge opportunity for new types of work. The raw power of this AI allows the car to become a service platform. In the future, a commute won't be lost time. It could be productive work time or ledger time. The value of a car changes from how fast it drives to how useful it is while you sit in it. So, Uber has the network and Rivian is working on some cutting edge tech. But there is one player missing from these interviews who might have the biggest advantage of all because they don't have to share the profit with anyone. While Uber is forced to split its profits with its partners and Rivian is still ramping up, Tesla is in a very strong position because they own the entire system, the car, the software, and the ride hailing network. Uber CEO admits they're an aggregator, essentially a middleman connecting you to other companies cars. Tesla, however, is building its own dedicated robo taxi and writing its own software. Additionally, Tesla's approach relies on cameras which are generally much cheaper to manufacture than the complex sensors many competitors like Whimo use. This is a difference between integration and aggregation. Uber is an aggregator. When you take a self-driving ride on Uber, Uber takes a cut and the car owner takes a cut. That double layer can keep costs higher. Tesla plays a vertical game. They build the car, they own the software, and they run the app. There is no middleman to pay. This gives Tesla a lot of flexibility on price. In a market where people just want the cheapest ride from A to B, having lower costs is a huge advantage. Because their hardware setup is simpler and less expensive to produce, they have room to undercut competitors on price while still making a profit. The deeper advantage here is data. Rivian talks about a data flywheel, but Tesla has had millions of cars on the road collecting data for years. This has helped them create a general purpose driving AI. Many competitors are limited to specific map cities. Tesla's goal is to build an AI that can drive anywhere, even on roads it's never seen before. This raw power means Tesla can potentially expand into new cities much faster than companies that need to carefully map every street. It also suggests that this same brain could one day be used for things beyond cars, like humanoid robots, expanding their business far beyond just transportation. This vertical integration is exactly why Kathy Wood of ArchInvest argues that Tesla is well valued. Her thesis is about the sassification of transportation. Kathy predicts that as the robo taxi network scales, Tesla will shift from a hardware business, selling a car once for maybe a 15% margin to a platform business, earning recurring revenue on every mile driven.

        "transcript": "So the question is, is this bad news for Nvidia? >> All right, so uh here's here's the story I want to dig into. You know, in our na last pod, we talked about China's uh sort of incredibly expanding role. So China is set to limit access to Nvidia's H200 chips despite uh Trump's export approval. So you know, President Trump says to Nvidia, \"Okay, you can export these.\" And now the China leadership is no no you can't buy them. You need to buy Chinese-made uh and you know GPUs. Uh fascinating, right? It's this is propping up its own chip economy. I think it's a smart move on China's behalf. >> This is so fun and annoying at the same time to watch. You know, this is pure protectionism. The US never did it before and now we're now we're playing the game. But you know what happens is a country invents something like an LCD TV or a car or you know whatever and another country says okay what we're going to do is we're going to protect the home market. We're going to manufacture our own. Then we're going to dump it on your market cheaply and we're going to dump it until your companies collapse and the venture capitalists all run away and then we're going to price it up. So what we did is we embargoed the chips from China and they're like oh shite we need to build our own whole supply chain. And as soon as they get it up and running, we're going to say, \"Oh, no, no, it's okay. Now, we're gonna actually allow you to buy the H200's.\" And that entire thing you just built makes no economic sense. And so, China's saying, \"All right, I I see what you're doing here. I've played this game for a long time. We're not going to we're not going to buy them.\" Like, but why? You know, it's an incredible buy. Why Why would you not allow us to buy them? Because we we already made a massive investment in our own fabs. We're going to have to keep subsidizing that to get this up and running because we know what you're doing here. You're going to let us buy them right up until our stuff collapses and then you're going to cut it off again. >> This is it's a trust issue. >> Big trust issue. >> There's no trust at all between the US and China right now. >> Well, this the same thing happened, right? The Japanese came over during Trump's first administration and spent a lot of time negotiating a trade deal and and then in just a few months ago, Trump um the administration cancelled that trade deal. And the Japanese are like, \"We're not negotiating another one because we don't know which way up is anymore.\" And every single time it changes completely. So there's no trade deal. And this is really a a big problem going forward. And I think what China is saying is we don't want to play that game. Well, there's no doubt that the outcome is look, two completely separate ecosystems. You Europe is kind of a wild card. It's interesting and and so is India is kind of a wild card right now, but there's no doubt the US ecosystem is going to grow completely independent of the China ecosystem because there's no chance of reestablishing trust after that chip embargo. >> There's like no way that that's going to get get mended. >> That's right. So, sovereign data center AI compute to Alex's point, >> it's it's a new it's almost like a second cold war. It it's it's a a world that we move to where there are spheres of influence and spheres of fab and spheres of compute and the decoupling happened. >> China is set to limit access to Nvidia's H200 chips despite Trump's export approval. President Trump says to Nvidia, \"You can export these.\" But China's leadership says, \"No, you can't buy them. You need to buy Chinese-made GPUs.\" Think about what China is actually seeing right now. They probably spent $und00 billion on building their own chip industry from scratch. New factories, new equipment, training thousands of engineers, building relationships with suppliers, all because the US said, \"You can't buy our chips anymore.\" Now, those factories are finally starting to produce chips that actually work. Not as good as Nvidia's yet, but good enough. Chinese companies are using them now, and the supply chain is coming together. Another one or two years, and they might actually be starting to get competitive with Nvidia. Right at that exact moment, the US shows up and says, \"Hey, actually, you can buy Nvidia chips again.\" Now, China looks at this and sees a trap because here's what happens if they say yes. Chinese tech companies immediately stop buying Chinese chips and switch back to Nvidia. Why wouldn't they do that? Nvidia chips are faster and better. Every Chinese AI company would make that switch overnight. So now all those new Chinese chip factories have no customers. They've just spent billions investing in production lines and are basically taking an ax to their demand. That could start a cascade of engineers getting laid off and the Chinese chip industry shrinking or at least suffering. But then what happens to China? Maybe two years later, the US changes its mind again. New policy, new restrictions. Sorry, you can't buy Nvidia chips again. And now China is right back where they started. Except worse, because they killed their own chip industry by switching to Nvidia. This already happened once. The US already cut them off. They already had to scramble to build alternatives. Now, the US wants them to abandon those alternatives right when they're starting to pay off. The pattern is obvious. Imagine you own a restaurant and you rely on one supplier for all your ingredients. Then one day that supplier says, \"We're not selling to you anymore.\" So, you then spend a year building relationships with new suppliers, completely restructuring your kitchen, training your staff on new ingredients. It's expensive and painful, but you make it work, or at least you're trying to make it work. Then right when everything is finally starting to get moving, the original supplier comes back and says, \"Hey, we'll sell to you again. Would you switch back?\" Probably not. Because what happens if they cut you off again in 6 months time? You'd be right back in crisis mode. Except now you've also destroyed all those new supplier relationships you just built. China has learned the hard way that relying on US chips is dangerous. Building their own chips is expensive, and the quality isn't there yet. But at least they control it. Nobody can take that away from them. The timing of the US offer makes it even more suspicious. Why now? The timing suggests the goal is specifically to kill the Chinese chip industry before it matures. The trust destruction goes way beyond semiconductors. When countries can't trust each other on trade, everything else gets harder. So that's why China is refusing. But what does this mean for the global technology landscape going forward? Alex said, \"There's no doubt the outcome is two completely separate ecosystems. The US ecosystem is going to grow completely independent of the Chinese ecosystem. If you're a tech company today, you're about to face a interesting choice. Do you build your products for the US market or for the Chinese market? You can't easily do both anymore because the underlying technology is completely different. Imagine you're developing an AI application in the US. You build it on Nvidia chips using CUDA and deploy it on AWS or Google Cloud. All of that is optimized to work together. You can hire engineers who know these tools. You can find documentation and examples everywhere. Everything works smoothly. Now, if you want to sell that same application in China, you have to rebuild it from scratch. Different chips means different optimization. Different frameworks means rewriting the code. Different cloud platforms means redesigning architecture. You're basically building two completely separate products. Most companies can't afford to do that, so they pick one market and ignore the other. That means innovation that happens in one ecosystem doesn't spread to the other. A breakthrough in Beijing doesn't help companies in San Francisco. A new technique developed in Silicon Valley doesn't reach Shanghai. This is really inefficient compared to how tech development usually works. Usually, the best ideas spread globally within months. Someone publishes a research paper, other teams implement it, improvements happen quickly because everyone can build on everyone else's work. That process just broke. The economic waste will be staggering. Right now, researchers in both countries are probably working on similar problems using different approaches because they can't share results effectively. Engineers are solving the same bugs twice. All that duplicated effort slows down everyone's progress. So why is China still making this choice? If Chinese companies go back to depending on US chips, they're betting their entire ecosystem on continued access to American technology. That's a bet they've already lost once. It's too much power to give to a potential adversary. So, China is willing to accept years of slower growth and high costs in exchange for building their own complete technology stack. Then, it's actually fascinating considering Europe because they're large enough to potentially avoid choosing. European companies could try to maintain access to both ecosystems. European cloud providers could offer services that work with both US and Chinese chips. Europe could position itself as neutral ground where both systems work. But maintaining that neutrality gets harder every year. The technical differences between the ecosystems keep growing. The political pressure to choose sides keeps increasing. At some point, Europe might be forced to pick one or the other despite wanting to stay neutral. India is in a similar position but with different advantages. India could potentially play both sides longer than most countries. A lot of people want to understand AI properly but feel overwhelmed by the jargon. I created a structured course that explains the fundamentals in simple language and then moves into more advanced topics. Once you join, you get lifetime access to all current and future modules. Just a note, the price increases as new modules are added. So, this is the cheapest it ever will be. One of our clients started with zero audience.

        "transcript": "Boy, are you in for a treat. I've got a big show for you here. Dan Ives just called 2026 a monster year for Tesla with a potential $3 trillion market cap on the cards driven by autonomous driving and robotics. Then Tom Lee explaining why the market still doesn't understand we're at the beginning of a decade long AI buildout, which means Nvidia might have plenty more room to grow from here. >> There's also a chance he says that it could hit a 3 trillion market cap by the end of that year. for more. Let's bring him in. He's here on set with me. Dan Ives is Wedbush global head of technology research. Welcome. >> Great to be here. >> You could have picked an easier one. You know, maybe Nvidia like why Tesla to you is it still so clear for all the ups and downs for the auto industry, for all of its ambitions, everything they want to do is always delayed. Granted, the market cap, you know, is still phenomenal. Why do you think 20 why do you feel so strongly that 2026 will be a great year? >> I think it's about autonomous. I mean all when it comes to physical AI, I think there's nothing better, you know, when when it comes to physical AI than Nvidia and Tesla. And I think this is going to be a golden chapter for Tesla when it comes when it comes to robo taxis, when it comes to cyber cabs, volume production, true autonomous, and of course, you look at robotics in terms of optimist. I mean, Kelly, that's why I think we're looking at two trillion ultimately, probably a $3 trillion market cap by late 2026, early 2027. That's why it continues to top there. >> What's the E? So, you know, you think about a market cap that big. You say, \"Okay, it's high multiple. I don't know what exactly the earnings look like.\" What are you anticipating on that front? And how do how do how does physical AI kind of feed directly into the earnings power it might have? I mean when I look out the next three four years I think earnings power is 4x 5x but because it's my view that you when you think about not just the FSD piece but in terms of true autonomous it's going to change the whole margin profile it changes the whole growth story and I think just going forward for Tesla the focus it's okay deliveries they matter of course they matter but in terms of next few years especially Musk now wartime CEO in terms of pay package you know as that's already cemented this is just the start and they're also going to have an ownership of XAI look what's happened SpaceX I mean I think we're now talking about this next AI chapter that's happened across the Musk ecosystem >> we had Dan Primack on last week and and he said you know I basically asked him or he said the question to ask is why is SpaceX going public now do you think there's anything related to financial pressure on Tesla or Musk or anything like that or is it a political why would 2026 be the year for SpaceX >> I think the time's right I mean you could argue valuation, right? Does it approach a trillion dollars? It's the same reason why it is, you know, anthropic or, you know, ultimately when when you look at open AI and others, I mean, we're hitting at a point where it's only year three of an 8 to 10 year buildout in terms of the AI revolution. And for the first time in 30 years, me and you've talked about this, you know, US is ahead of China when it comes to tech, but Space X is in inflection point. I think it's important that it goes public. It's the right time. And and look, we are in, I think, two more years in this tech bull market and we're going to see more and more of these great private companies going public. >> Won't SpaceX be, if you'll pardon the term, sexier than Tesla? In other words, right now, if you are a big fan of Elon Musk and everything he's doing in the future, as described, this is the only public equity you can own for that story. Now, SpaceX could be the newer, younger thing on the block. What if investors go with that and thus remove some of the halo, right? the the community effect around those who hold shares of Tesla and support its valuation just to have a peace of mind. >> Yeah, it's a great point. Look, I actually think it expands. I mean, to some extent, the ecosystem from SpaceX to Tesla and ultimately what's going to be the ownership of XAI because the reality is when you think about what's happening here. I mean, we're talking about the next 5, 10, 15 years. Musk at the centerpiece of it. But I think it speaks to when you when it comes to Tesla that continues to be the best play because I think autonomous is worth a trillion dollars alone. You think about Optimus in terms of true robotics and as this all plays out I think globally I mean they can own 70 80% of the autonomous market you know over the globally over the coming years. >> I know you think that full self-driving penetration could be as high as 50%. In other words, half the people who buy a Tesla pay the extra money to have that option, which would be, as you say, a gamecher for margins and for the stock. So that's part of what you're talking about is for those who own Teslas, they use this technology. The other part is the cyber cab is what is it called? And how would you describe its position in this Visa v Whimo where >> Whimo also does quite well? The car is really expensive um regulatory and otherwise. What should we expect on the uh like the cyber cap front from Tesla? >> Well, first like FSD, you're going to go from penetration 15% to 50 and and I think could even be higher. So from a margin perspective, that's going to be huge. Look, Whimo, Whimo is going to be a rounding error relative to what Tesla's going to do. I think not just in the US, but I think globally. Look, it speaks to just how expensive those cars are, how they could scale. And I think when you think about autonomous and in terms of the road map, I mean, we would expect probably some sort of executive order, you know, going into early next year, what I think is going to clear in terms of the federal road map. I mean, more and more you're going to go away from the states to federal and that's going to be extremely important for Tesla in terms of where I think they could take robo tax. Tesla's autonomous vehicle fleet generating billions in realworld training miles and Nvidia's complete infrastructure stack from chips to software creates modes in physical AI that competitors can't easily replicate because both require decadelong investments that only show returns once the technology reaches commercial scale. Physical AI requires solving problems that pure software AI never faces. An LLM making a mistake means generating wrong text. A self-driving car making mistake kills people. A humanoid robot dropping a package is annoying. A robot in a factory dropping heavy machinery creates liability and safety disasters. The margin for error in physical AI needs to approach zero, which means you need massive amounts of real world training data to handle edge case scenarios that simulations miss. Tesla's moat comes from having millions of vehicles on roads collecting this data daily. Every Tesla with FSD enabled encounters scenarios that improve the neural network. Whimo operates just thousands of vehicles in liberties. The data collection gap between Tesla and Whimo spans three orders of magnitude and it compounds because more data enables better autonomous performance which justifies higher FSD adoption which generates even more training data. Nvidia's mode in physical AI comes from vertical integration across the entire stack. They don't just sell chips. They provide CUDA software libraries, simulation environments like Isaac for robots, training frameworks optimized for their hardware and reference architectures for deploying at scale. A competitor can build chips that match Nvidia's raw performance. But matching the complete ecosystem requires years of software development and thousands of engineers building tools developers actually want to use. The switching costs aren't just about chip performance. They're about rewriting all of your training code, rebuilding simulation environments, and losing access to the largest developer community in AI. Companies invest millions integrating NVIDIA stack into their workloads. Moving to alternatives means writing off those investments and delaying products by years while engineers learn new tools. The timeline to commercialization creates another barrier competitors can't overcome quickly. Tesla spent a decade and tens of billions developing autonomous driving before reaching the point where removing safety drivers makes sense. Starting today, a competitor needs similar time and capital investment to match current Tesla capability. But by the time they finish, Tesla will have advanced another decade with more data, better models, and established market position. The same dynamic applies to human mode robots, where Tesla's factory deployments will generate robotic trained data competitors don't have access to. Nvidia's position benefits from being the training platform for everyone's AI, including competitors attempting to build custom AI chips. Every new AI application gets prototyped on Nvidia's hardware first because it's the path to the least resistance. By the time custom chips reach production, Nvidia already has next generation products and the application developer already optimized their models for Nvidia's architecture. Next up, Tom Lee is making some pretty significant predictions. Check this out. Joining us now, Tom Lee, Funstrat, head of research. Tom, great to have you with us. Um, there's a lot of things to talk about with you in terms of the skepticism now around the AI trade, skepticism around Bitcoin. Are they in fact related, do you think? >> Uh, related, but not related. Yeah. You know, I I think the AI trade, I mean, it's been a juggernaut, and we know that the visibility for the next few years is really good, but now investors are just trying to figure out how much to discount. You know, what's the appropriate price to put um and that could drive some profit taking because they've done so well this year. On the crypto side, I I think that there has been some concerns about uh you know, quantum and then there was that huge deleveraging event on October 10th, but the crypto fundamental story I mean is exiting on a really high note this year. You know, the US government passed legislation and regulations favorable for crypto and we know Wall Street has expressed a lot of interest in building products on the blockchain. So, it's almost like they both have great visibility, but the price levels are just what's being uncertain. >> I feel like what's common though with both of these stories though, Tom, is investors questioning the growth, the trajectory of growth going forward for both of these stories. Not to say that that things will slow will contract, but maybe growth won't be as strong as we've seen. We've we've hit the peak sort of growth rates in terms of the story. the maximum bullishness happened with Bitcoin when the administration came on board and things started to sort of go Bitcoin's way. Maybe that was peak sort of trajectory higher when it comes to growth. Same thing with AI. Now it's a period where you're sort of wondering, will this actually get funded after we saw this massive expansion? >> Yeah. Well, in in crypto, the best years are definitely ahead because today there's only 4 million Bitcoin wallets with $10,000 in it. There's 900 million IRA and brokerage accounts globally that have $10,000. So there's that's 200 times larger market. Um with regard to AI, I I do think that the business models need to evolve. You know, you can't just charge $20 a month. I mean really AI agentic services and but the the market ends up being huge because in the US it's really making 130 million existing workers into super workers. I mean, that's a several trillion dollar market just in the US alone. So, I I think there's still opportunities. >> When do you think that we're going to see the tipping point on that front? I think arguably you're seeing it a little bit maybe on the margins right now. But do you see a step change? 18 months out from now? Is that 5 years out from now? It's because there's also questions, by the way, about some of these services and what how valuable they are to people right now. And I know some CTO's and others who are actually saying, you know, we're actually not getting the value out of some of these products that we were hoping to. >> Yeah, it's I think we're in what the phase what I'd call the bleeding edge phase, like where everything feels like the tech is in front of the applications. that happened in mobile, which I studied for 17 years, and in internet early days, you know, like when color phones first came out on on mobile or even keyboards, people kind of sneered and said, you know, who's going to be using a color screen? >> And remember famously what happened when the iPhone was launched and and how the one of the biggest competitors dismissed it and saying it's just a toy, right? >> I think we're at that phase with AI where the capabilities will blossom and then services will follow. But that as you know the future happens faster than many expect. >> So if the business models of these players which people commonly call the mag 7 in general um need to change then what does that do to the valuation? Are we rethinking the valuation? Because I mean one distinct change has definitely already happened and that is asset light to asset heavy asset spending on assets continues etc. Um is that reflected already or does there need to be further adjustment? Uh, I'm I believe that AI stocks, especially stocks like Nvidia, are going to actually rerate higher because if Walmart and Costco trade at 37 to 45 times earnings because they're predictable, then Nvidia shouldn't be 27 times. I also think the banks are really criminally undervalued right now, like a JP Morgan, because that's becoming a technology company. And in the past people are stuck in the head that they should trade at one time spoker 10 times earnings. I mean they should trade more like a tech stock. So I think tech and >> financial out of all the banks or you I mean JP Morgan in particular has invested obviously heavily in tech but if I said JP Morgan and then I mentioned a bank 10 rungs down would you say the same thing? >> Uh well it depends on how sort of evangelized a bank is towards adopting AI and being tech forward. So, okay, on this screen right here, like is Wells Fargo on your list of of tech forward banks? >> It possibly Goldman certainly is and I think Morgan Stanley has shown a lot of evidence. So, I think banks are sort of getting it, but I they are really becoming technology companies. >> So, even at record highs, >> even at record highs, >> you know, as uh many technology technical strategists will tell you, it's actually sometimes better to buy things at all-time highs. Tom Lee is arguing the market under values AI infrastructure because investors are still thinking in terms of cyclical semiconductors rather than recognizing Nvidia as a predictable platform company that captures revenue every time AI deploys at scale. Investors remember Intel's dominance in CPUs, giving way to declining growth and margin compression. They assume Nvidia faces similar dynamics where competitors emerge, custom chips fragment the market, and growth inevitably slows. But Nvidia's business model differs fundamentally from historical semiconductor companies because AI deployments create compounding demand rather than replacement cycles. Every company deploying AI needs compute for training and inference. Every autonomous vehicle needs AI chips. Every robot needs edge computing. Every data center needs accelerated computing for modern workloads. This demand doesn't disappear during economic downturns the way consumer PC sales collapse. The comparison to mobile phone adoption and the iPhone dismissal by Nokia reveals we're much earlier into AI deployment than the market pricing suggests. When color screens first appeared on phones, critics questioned their utility. When the iPhone launched, BlackBerry and Nokia executives laughed at the lack of keyboard and questioned whether consumers would pay premium prices. 5 years later, the smartphone revolution had destroyed those incumbent companies and transformed how billions of people live and work. AI sits at a similar infection point where the technology exists but mass deployment hasn't happened. Consumers use chat GBT and similar tools but AI hasn't become as essential as smartphones or internet access. This early stage means Nvidia's revenue growth could sustain for years if adoption and as adoption is expected to accelerate. The progression from bleeding edge to mainstream typically takes 5 to 10 years in technology cycles. Cloud computing took a decade from AWS launch to becoming the default deployment model. Mobile took similar time from iPhone launch to becoming ubiquitous. AI infrastructure is likely to follow the same trajectory, which means Nvidia's current scale represents the early innings of a decadel long growth opportunity rather than a late cycle peak before full decline. It's just my opinion, not financial advice. The trillion dollar market from making 130 million US workers into super workers demonstrates the scale of the untapped opportunity. Most workers don't use AI meaningfully yet. Knowledge workers experiment with chat GPT but haven't integrated AI into daily workflows. Manufacturing hasn't deployed AI powered robotics broadly. Logistics still operates mostly without autonomous systems. Healthcare uses minimal AI despite enormous potential. The gap between current adoption and full deployment spans orders of magnitude. As this gap closes over the next decade, every step function improvement in AI capabilities requires more NVIDIA infrastructure to train better models and run inference at scale. The revenue compounds because better AI enables more applications which justify more deployment which requires more compute which funds development of even better AI. Picture this. A potential client searches for what your business offers and your YouTube video appears. Before they've even booked a call, they've built trust with you, turning them into a warm lead. That's why our clients are hitting $100,000 months because YouTube turns attention into authority. If you run a business, book a call. and I'll show you exactly how to make this"
