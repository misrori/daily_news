        "transcript": "2026 is going to be unusual. It's going to be like nothing you've seen before. And while it may put a lot of investors in the poor house, it will make a lot of smart investors extremely wealthy if they act correctly. So what you got to do is think, act and react accordingly. So you can be in the second group, not in the first. For that, I only ask you that you listen. So don't click nothing, don't smash nothing, don't buy nothing. Just listen to me in this video. I'm going to tell you exactly what I think 2026 is going to do, how it's going to play out, the reasoning and the logic behind it, and finally my strategy on how to think, act, and react for what's coming because we may see something we haven't seen in a long, long time. And you don't want to be unprepared for that sort of event. Now, to give you just a general idea of where we're coming from right now, we have a lot of chatter in social media about what's going to happen in 2026. On the one hand, Den Ives is saying we got two more years of this bull market insanity. On the other hand, Tom Lee is becoming slightly less bullish, giving a lukewarm prediction for 2026 with a 7,700 target and saying that there might be some turbulence, but still remaining somewhat bullish. But I think it goes deeper. I think to understand the magnitude of the event we're about to get in 2026, you have to start with the foundations, understand exactly what's going on, understand the underlying circumstances that are going to drive the market and then understand eventually the possibilities of how this whole thing play out and then prepare accordingly. So, number one, going as back as October of 2022, we are now up 90% in 3 years on the S&P 500. In 3 years, we went from 3600 on the S&P 500 all the way to 6,800 as of the making of this video. In a normal cycle, we would have expected to see a 30% return for those three years because on average, that's what we get about 10% a year on the S&P 500. Which means that for the past 3 years, we've essentially been running at triple speed at three times faster than the average run rate of the market. And that means that the market is running hot. But a lot of investors misunderstand that portion and they misunderstand what it means because in itself it's not an indication of a problem. And while it is true that averages serve as a magnet and the higher you get away from the magnet, the stronger the pull begins and like gravity the magnet always wins. It doesn't necessarily happen when you think it needs to happen. The fact is that we can have multiple years with these bull runs happen again and again and again and it being absolutely normal. In fact, over the past four decades, the past 40 years, we had four stretches of five consecutive bull market years, which means that if you do a little math, at 50% of the time over the past 40 years, we've been in a fiveyear consecutive bull market. Four times where we had five consecutive good years on the S&P 500 over the past 40 years. That's not abnormal. That's not unusual and it's not rare even though it feels like it. So in itself, we're not gonna crash just because we're on a hot streak in the market. That in itself is never a reason and never cause and never an indication that the market is about to slow down. It feels like that, but it's not. You got to forget about this, right? What you do want to take a look at is fundamentals, right? Fundamentally speaking, right now, we're set up to continue the AI spending into 2026. And along with the lower rates that we're getting from the central bank, with the Fed cutting interest rates, we're going to have a lot of money flowing into the economy from AI infrastructure, from lower rates, from borrowing, from the banks. So, we will have a money flood going into the market in 2026. We will also have companies as a result of that continue to post great earnings, great profits, great numbers, which means that it will drive valuations of companies a lot higher that we see today. I know it sounds crazy because we're already at all-time highs. It doesn't matter. We will have a new normal in 2026 because the money flood will create such a terrific result for these companies. It's going to drive valuations even higher, even away from what normal is. And that is going to increase in turn the retail participation. The more people see the stock market going crazy, the more everyday people that have no business in investing in the stock market will pile into the market without any understanding, armed with nothing but the Dunning Krueger effect. They will be piling into the market. The more dangerous it becomes, the more they're going to be driving themselves in, mortgaging the house, putting everything they got into stocks and crypto. And on top of that, we've got small caps primed for an absolute explosion because as rates come down, a lot of these companies who are heavily financed by debt and even if you look at the debt structure of set companies on the Russell, basically a lot of it is variable interest, which means that these rate cuts will have a dramatic impact on small caps, driving them to complete the closure of the gap they've opened from the S&P 500. What do I mean by that? Well, over the past year, the S&P is up 13%. Give or take. The Russell, the small caps only did 6%. Essentially, from going from 2400 to 2500 in a year. So, that gap will close as a result of the interest rate cuts and the monetary policy. And that's going to drive even more retail participation, which means we might see things in the stock market in 2026 we haven't seen in a long, long time. In fact, I think it's very likely we're going to have a 25 to 30% year in 2026 going all the way to 8,500 on the S&P 500. And just to explain to you what this means that if the index does 25% to 30% in 2026 speaking about the S&P 500 of course companies with beta of three like Palunteer are allegedly supposed to make about 75% just based on the beta in 2026. Now I'm not saying that Palanteer will do a 75% in 2026 but I'm saying the overall impact on the market is going to be ginormous way bigger than 25%. Now going from 6,800 to 8,500 sounds extremely bullish and it is. But you have to understand that no stock market can defy gravity. No stock market is just going to continue to go up endlessly forever and ever and ever. We will have the eventual gravity kick in and it's going to happen when people are least prepared because the euphoria is going to be absolutely in max. Right now, if you take a look at the market cycle that's leading up to what I call the euphoric spike, you start with hope, you move on to optimism, then you go to belief. I think those three stages played out very, very nicely between 2023 and 2025. The last two and a half years, three years, however you want to put it, we're going from hope to belief. But the biggest upside, the biggest insanity happens from stage three, which is the belief to thrill and then finally to euphoria. The gains that are made from belief to euphoria are exponentially higher than anything you've gotten for the first three stages combined. And that is where opportunities are created. That is where the most of the explosion happens. But also, unfortunately, this is where cycles end. And this is where the chair gets pulled, the rug gets pulled, the music stops, whatever you want to use in this situation. This is the end of the cycle when it happens. And I think 2026 is going to have that massive explosion into the stratosphere, but also the end of the cycle. Now, whether it happens in the second half of 2026, 6, 7 months from now, whether it happens in Q4 of 2026, or maybe even in the beginning of 2027, I'm not sure. I can't time it to perfection and tell you, hey, this is the exact date where this going to happen because I don't know. And anybody who's claiming otherwise are simply lying to you. There's no way to predict this. But the setup is being created for this euphoric explosion into the stratosphere and then the end of the cycle. Now, this risk is elevated in my opinion going forward into 2026 because of a few things, right? And like I'm saying in every video I make, when we talk about risks, we're not talking about schedule events. We're not talking about something that is 100% certain to happen. We don't know. We're talking about possibilities here. And the fact is that this may not play out this way. And maybe we have bull markets for another 3 years. Who knows? But there is definitely elevated risk. And I want to address this risk because I'm not in the business of predicting. I'm in the business of preparing. And when I identify new risks, I think, act and react. Okay. So number one, if I look realistically at the job market, at the labor market right now, we are in what seems to be a very gradual but sustainable decline. It continues to happen week in week out and it will continue to do so unless it stopped until it finally goes beyond the breaking point. Much like with getting a root canal, the root canal did not start yesterday. It's been many, many months of neglect that led to the root canal. So [snorts] the job market also starts up very tame, very gradual decline that's almost unfelt, unreported, and then it finally breaks. And when it breaks, it's really too late. Now, because of that, I think that a lot of people also misunderstand that the consumer strength that we've got right now in the market is dependent on the labor market remaining strong because guess what? When people don't have jobs, they're not really that keen about spending money. So, as the job market declines and slowly deteriorates gradually but sustainably, the consumer strength also starts to deteriorate along the way in parallel. And it also slows down causing a very very vicious cycle where that causes even less spending which causes more job loss which causes even less spending and it starts a vicious cycle. Now the rate cuts from the Fed are designed to mitigate that risk. But as it stands right now, these few cuts we've seen are not going to prevent this from happening. We haven't seen a dramatic move by the Fed. The Fed remains somewhat hawkish, although they're not as hawkish, but they've not gone full-on dovish mode. And because of that, they are behind the curve. And the job market and the consumer strength will at some point break unless they make a dramatic U-turn, which doesn't seem to be the case right now. What seems to be the case right now is that the Fed is cutting rates, but not fast enough to prevent this from happening. Now the rate cuts they're doing in itself is not a freeof risk event. You have to understand it's not the Fed is trying to kill the job market. The Fed is very aware of the fact that cutting rates too fast might bring inflation, might bring it back from underneath the floorboards because like we've seen in the late7s when inflation is initially killed, but it survives and then it comes back for a second go round. It comes back a lot better, a lot bigger, a lot stronger and then the impact is a lot worse than the initial inflationary spike. That is the biggest fear from the Fed. But as they're starting to see that the job market is getting slower, it's getting weaker, they have no choice but to start cutting rates even though inflation is still not at 2%. Which means that between the allowance of more money to flow into the market, the money printer going and on top of this it will be added and increased multiplied by a couple hundred times by the AI spending that's also going to flood the market with lots and lots of money. You have these parallel processes that are going on. On the one hand, we have job loss and we have a slowdown in the labor market. On the other hand, by increasing the flow of money into the market, we're creating more demand and we're creating more inflationary pressures. So, we got inflationary pressures going up, labor market weakening, and this is literally the definition of stackflationary pressures. Stackflation means high unemployment, high inflation. Not saying it's bound to happen, but there will be stackflationary pressures building up in the market as we go deeper and deeper into 2026 in the late '7s. That is what we saw. And it is a very very dangerous thing. Now whether it happens or not, I don't know. But the risk is certainly there. It's there as of the second half of 2026, maybe the final quarter of 2026, maybe as I said the beginning of 2027. But it will begin to form. it is inevitable because of the different factors that are in play. Now, of course, if anything changes, the Fed changes the policy. If anything changes, I'll be on here to talk about it. But as it stands right now, this is what I see. Now, for the stock market investors, it's very important to try and identify as much as possible what I call a late cycle pattern. The end of cycles, bullish cycles that is doesn't just happen out of thin air. There are catalysts on the fundamental side, on the macro side that are triggering this end of cycle event. It doesn't just happen. Okay. Now, of course, I'm not here saying that you can time the stock market. Not at all. But I'm here to say that there are certain commonalities that we can identify in previous end of cycle events. And I'm going to give you right now the list of things that are kind of should be at least on your watch list as you're trying to figure out, hey, is this the beginning of the late cycle or not? If you can spot these five factors in the market, it means there's a good chance, although not certainty, that we're looking at a late cycle pattern. Number one, speculative inflows increased by 10x. All of a sudden, everybody is investing non-stop in speculative plays and making lots and lots of money. You've seen part of it in 2021 with all these madeup companies. You've seen it a lot more intense in the com crash. Number two, massive returns in a very short time when people tell you, \"Hey, you've only done 30% this year. You don't know what you're doing.\" Warning sign. Number three, record debt and record margin. When people become euphoric about the stock market, when they think that stocks only go up, this is where you're going to see a lot of margin, and that's going to be another warning sign for you. Number four, extreme valuations. Looking at the S&P 500 and seeing a P of 35, 37, maybe even 40. And of course, number five, euphoric sentiment. Now, right now, it's not even close to that. The fear and greed index is in fear. But in the euphoric sentiment, it's max greed and it's absolutely this feeling that markets will never stop. These are the red flags that should be on your watch list as you're trying to figure out, hey, what's going on with 2026 as we go deeper and deeper into that year. Now, if this is a correct prediction about how 2026 plays out, we will have record highs in 2026, but we will also have a serious correction, a major correction, even stronger than 2022 and might be even longer. So, it's important to understand it. It's important to prep for it. And it's important to mentally, emotionally, and financially have a plan how to adjust to it. So you utilize that to make even more money, which is exactly what happened in 2022. In 2022, even though it was a sample size of a mini, mini, mini bare market, a lot of people ran away from the stock market. A lot of people got spooked by the stock market, stopped investing, while people who bought stocks like Pilenteer at $6 have made generational wealth. these crashes, corrections, drops, whatever you want to call it, these are money-making opportunities. So, it's important that you understand that. Now, having said that, here's what not to do with this information. I just gave you my thesis. I gave you my prediction for 2026, my guesstimate. Here's what not to do with this info. Number one, don't panic. It's pointless. It's not going to get you anywhere. Number two, don't assume you can just sell out of the market right now and prevent this from ever happening to you. Because just want to remind you that Alan Greenspin, who was the chair of the Federal Reserve in 1997, came out to the media and said, \"Look folks, this is the end. We're about to crash. This is insanity. The market is in irrational exuberance.\" This was 1997. From that point on, the market doubled itself until it finally crashed in the dotcom crash. So he was kind of right, but it was 2 years early, which means that if you listen to him, you missed out on the 100% opportunity, right? So you don't want to panic. You don't want to sell your portfolio. You don't want to liquidate everything and just run for the hills. That's never a good solution. You know, not being in the market is always a bad idea. Number two is you don't want to try and time the market. A lot of people have ideas about, well, let's just wait for the first half of 2026 because Tom told us and on June 30th we're going to liquidate our portfolio and get the hell out of dodge and that where we'll be fine. That's also a bad idea because essentially what this means is that you are buying yourself a trip to a world of hurt pretty much because you don't know when this event if at all happens. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it happens in the first quarter of 2026 and you don't have time to pack up your stuff and get out. It's not a wise thing to unprepare and unstrategize and completely ignore this or try to time it. So panic is a bad idea. Trying to figure out a way to time this perfectly is a bad idea. What is a good idea? What to do? Okay. So I think it's important to understand that the mindset you should adopt with these sort of events is we want to prepare. We do not want to predict. So again we want to think act react. It's very very simple. So number one is you have to chill, relax and continue to dollar cost average into the market non-stop even with everything I just told you. Reason being that the strength of compound interest and the strength of the market over the long haul is so strong that even if you had the worst possible luck on earth, if you started investing one day before the dotcom crash and you finished investing in the 2022 bare market and in the middle you had the last decade, basically you still made 340% on your money in 20 years. So, even at the worst possible time the market has had over the past 50, 60, god knows how many years, if you've made every possible choice wrong except continue to dollar cost average for two decades, you made 334%. That's number one. Number two, you have to prep, which means you have to mitigate risk, which means that as long as you continue to invest, you have to protect your backside, which means increase your protections, increase your defense. And there's a lot of different ways to do it. Number one, for example, you can take a portion of your portfolio and turn it into a cockroach portfolio. Meaning essentially one quarter bonds, one quarter gold, one quarter cash and one quarter defensive stocks. You can actually increase just the mere exposure to defensive stocks in your portfolio independently of that. stocks like staples, toothbrush, toilet paper, stocks like healthcare, stocks like telecom. These sectors when the S&P dropped 50% over the last few crashes only dropped about 20%. Because people still need toilet paper, toothbrush, and their pharmaceuticals, and they still need to use the phone and the internet, right? So, increasing exposure to these sort of stocks will also protect your behind. Of course, if you haven't done so, you can still add more exposure to a broad market index because unlike a stock like Palanteer, for example, that in a really bad correction can drop 70 80% like it's nothing, you know, a broad market index probably is going to drop 30 to 40%. Right? It's a significant upgrade to protection. And of course, if you have any hype pure blue sky stocks that are driven by real insanity, it's a good time to get rid of them and to replace them with quality long-term plays. And if you haven't done so, you have to create a cash reserve. And it's also a pragmatic need. I mean, if there is a crash, a downturn, you're going to need some cash to live off so you don't sell your portfolio at a loss. But also, you need some money to deploy. You need some gunpowder to deploy when the market actually drops. Of course, if you have margin, that's a good time to get rid of that margin. And if you don't have any bonds in your portfolio, now would be a good time to add the bonds again to add some protection. But mostly, it's also a good time to write down your investing constitution, your entire thesis for every single stock on a piece of paper, and to structure and lay out your multi-year approach for investing to avoid getting spooked and scared and driven into emotional decisions which are not going to be beneficial to your financial future. Now, I've made a whole two and a half hour lecture, including a full-on presentation about how to prep for this event, how it's going to happen, how it's going to play out, a full defense program. All of this is on our academy, patreon.com/dommnash. You can join the academy right now. The latest lecture is a two and a half hour lecture on that point. Deep dive. I just gave you the highlights today, but if you want to dive deep into this, if you want to learn this, if you want to see the presentation, and if you want to just ask me questions about it, because we have a weekly office hours where you guys come in live and ask me questions as much as you want, join the academy. Would love to see you there at patreon.com/domnash. We teach people how to become better long-term investor. If this is something that interests you, would love to see you in the academy. Thank you so much. I'll see you in the next one."
