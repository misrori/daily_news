        "transcript": "I've got two huge clips for you today as Gene Monster just laid out why Wall Street keeps getting AI growth wrong and Tom Lee explained why the market's going to put everyone through an emotional meat grinder before hitting new highs. So, keep watching for both. >> Why don't we start talking about AI because that was the dominating story in technology for 2025. And early in 2025, it was a Chinese company, Deceas AI was going to be in the United States. Um, what do you think is happening right now? What's your expectation for AI here? Will it be challenged? And is this a place that you think is going to see higher stock prices this year? I >> mean, at the highest level, I think we're still early in this broader AI trade. I still think we have two to three years left of a position where the NASDAQ performs plus 10% largely driven by AI and I think AI first companies continue to move higher than that. So I'm most optimistic. I recognize that that theme of still being early is a little bit out of place with where the market's been since the end of October when we started to see a shift after Meta's results and Nvidia's results where there has been more skepticism kind of a little bit of that deepseek fear that you talked about creeping back into investor psychology. But the big picture is this is that these companies are going to continue to grow in calendar 26 faster than what expectations. I can give you two quick examples. Foxcon reported their December quarter today. Uh they are not only a customer of Nvidia but also a partner. They manufacture some of Nvidia GPUs. Uh they grew at 22%. The street was looking for 13%. That's an 8% revenue upside. So that's an indication we're continuing in that spot of higher for longer. Uh separately tonight we're going to get at 4 Eastern. Jensen's going to from Nvidia is going to be giving his keynote at CES. Um the last time he gave a big uh keynote was back on October 28th. He gave guidance essentially for 54% revenue growth this year. The streets at 50 and that excludes China and any new booking. So I suspect that Nvidia is probably going to grow 65% plus this year. And then lastly, uh 9:30 Eastern tonight, we're going to get uh Sue from AMD. She's going to give a keynote also at CES and I expect her message to be pretty pretty straightforward that we're still early. So Becky, when I put all this together, uh I recognize this feels like too wellraveled of a playbook to continue to be a success. This continue to be long AI, but I'm optimistic that the numbers are still too low for this year. We're still early. >> Yeah. Gene, just in terms of what you're anticipating, let's start with Nvidia. You said the streets at 50%, you're looking for 65% or even north of that this year. You think Jensen Wong's going to lay that out today or do you think he'll be a little more cautious in what he's explaining or describing? Because I mean, those are pretty lofty expectations to try and be. >> Well, the 54 it's l it's not lofty if you think that they can grow 65% plus and it's not lofty if you believe we were still early in this. >> No, but do you think he's going to signal that today? I I realize that's what you're looking for, but do you think he'll actually say that today? Because so much of what happens in the market is expectations, beating expectations. Um being able to anticipate that things are going to be even better than than what they've said to this point. >> Um yeah, thanks for the clarification there. I think the bottom line is I expect him to reiterate his comments from October 28th. We expect 500 billion in cumitive Blackwell and Reuben revenue through the end of calendar 26. That implies 54% growth. I also believe that he will reiterate that that excludes any China revenue and excludes any additional bookings which I think he will make indications that things continue to be strong. And so I think the exact details of his guidance are going to say this 54% number, but there's upside to it. And I think it comes down to I I think that that gap between where the streets at versus what Nvidia's been saying, what we're seeing in the marketplace from Fox Con today. That gap gives you a sense of uh kind of some of the apprehension that investors have that analysts have that this uh bull market's going to continue. But to answer your question, yes, I think that uh today's going to be a good day for Nvidia. I think tomorrow's going to be a good day, too, because I think Jensen's comments are going to continue to reiterate that they essentially can't keep up with demand. >> Is that your favorite pick, Nvidia? >> So, we Deep Water, we do own Nvidia. So, that's uh I think if you want to know what our favorite picks are, look at what's in our portfolio. Nvidia's in there. I think for calendar 26, Google is going to continue to be a big surprise. Today, Samsung talked about doubling their Gemini devices for calendar 20 to 800 million ship this year versus 400 million next year. So, Google at also at the top of the list. And uh this Foxcon news that I talked about is also positive for Apple and that's our kind of we think that's going to be the best performing large cap in the first half of this year. So, uh I think those are those are the big three that we're focused on. Gan walks through how sentiment has changed since October and mentions that skepticism about the AI trade is being overdone. Gan thinks that Nvidia will probably grow closer to 65% or more this year and that's excluding China revenue entirely, plus anything new that comes in. You've basically got a weird situation here where everyone knows the AI story. Everyone's heard about Nvidia. Everyone's read about massive data center buildouts. The trade feels crowded. And when something feels obvious, when it feels like everyone's already made the money on it, your brain starts looking for reasons to be skeptical. That's what happened after October. Meta reported earnings. Nvidia reported earnings. And instead of celebrating, investors started asking, \"Okay, but when does this slow down?\" The Deep Seek story gave people a concrete reason to worry. Maybe AI doesn't need expensive chips. Maybe there's cheaper ways to do this. Maybe Nvidia's monopoly breaks down. But Gene saying that psychological shift was happening while sentiment was turning negative but the underlying business kept accelerating. Foxcon helped build the server racks for Nvidia's GPUs. And as Jean says they're also a customer buying Nvidia chips. They beat revenue expectations by eight percentage points growing 9 points faster than analysts expected. And that's because factories were running faster than Wall Street thought was possible. Drawing paradigm shifts, traditional forecasting models break. Analysts build models based on historic growth rates, market penetration curves, and spending patterns. But as we know, the AI infrastructure buildout doesn't follow any historical pattern we have. There's no comp for every major tech company on Earth simultaneously building massive data centers. Cloud computing scaled over more than a decade. Companies gradually shifted from onremise service to AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. that gave analysts time to build models, understand adoption curves, and forecast growth. AI infrastructure is compressing that timeline into a few years, and its net new capital expenditure on top of everything else. Jensen keeps reiterating they can't keep up with demand. When supply can't meet demand, companies don't compete on features or service. They compete by securing allocation. Many of these companies are not price sensitive buyers right now. If Nvidia says, \"We're raising prices 20%,\" those companies would pay it because the alternative is falling behind their competitors. Insane pricing power only exists when you genuinely cannot produce enough to satisfy demand. Gene mentions Apple as one of his top picks for the first half of the year, partially based on this Foxcon data. Apple's been oddly quiet in the AI narrative compared to Microsoft or Google, for example. But Foxcon manufacturing Apple products at that growth rate suggests Apple's AI integration into devices is ramping up. So you've got this psychological gap. Sentiment turned negative in October. Fear crept in. The headlines also talked about deepseek and competition and whether the spending makes sense, but the actual companies are beating expectations growing faster and running into supply constraints, not demand problems. Jeans making the bullc case on fundamentals while acknowledging the psychological shift. Let's see what Tom Lee has to say and predict about 2026. This scares the This is the Wall Street Journal. This is like the worst headline you could possibly have. Wall Street expects experts expect rally to keep going. Just don't don't even if you think it, don't print it. Don't say that. I I mean that to me just just makes me think that it could definitely could be it could be a down year. >> Yeah, but it wasn't splashed in the top of the page. It's only a little bit >> and you're right in there because you think 7700 by the end of 2026 with a 15 to 20% correction at some point in in uh the second half of the year. >> Yeah. Like compressed in one year will be joy, depression, and rally. Right. I think just like last year in 2025 we had a terrible start. People got very gloomy then we had a nice rally to finish the year. >> You mean April was the >> Yeah. April was the low >> liberation day. >> Yeah. >> So I I think because you know the market will test the new Fed. That probably is the reason we have some fear this year. But there's a lot of things to be optimistic about. You know the tariffs are anniversarying. the Fed is cutting and you know the ISM could finally turn back above 50 and that's good news and you know I we are pretty optimistic about some groups that have lagged like energy is our one of our top sector picks this year >> with the MAG 7 >> and the MAG 7 should still keep producing good earnings growth and then the financials and small cap so it's like uh a lot of things that could go right in the market >> the 7700 so is do we get a 10% gain in earnings and the multiple stays where it is. Is that is that your thesis? Basically, >> uh I think earnings will do even better >> and the multiple comes down. >> Yeah. So, it's cuz other sectors are rerating, but the mag 7 might just track their earnings growth. So, that'll pull the overall PE down. Tom draws a parallel to 2025, which started terribly, hit a low in April, then rallied strong into year end. He thinks a similar pattern plays out this year because the market will test the new Fed administration. Tom's target is 7,700 for the S&P, but he explicitly forecasts a 15 to 20% draw down during the second half before the year ends higher. So Tom's predicting both all-time highs and a large correction. Remember that bull markets don't just go up in a straight line. The strongest, most durable bull markets regularly experience sharp pullbacks that feel like the world's ending while they're happening. Then three months later, you're at new all-time highs, and the correction feels like ancient history. Tom's just forecasting normal volatility inside a structural uptrend. At the start of the year, people optimistic. The calendar flips, new year resolutions, fresh start energy, and everyone's got their price targets out. Analysts publish their annual outlooks. That's all a lot of joy, but nothing fundamental changed. On January the 1st, Tom said the market will test the new Fed. New Fed chair, different approach to policy and unclear as to how they'll respond to various economic scenarios. Markets hate uncertainty, so they test. They push prices down to see if the Fed panics. That testing process is the depression phase Tom is talking about. We'll have the tariff anniversary. When tariffs first hit, they were a shock. Companies scrambled to address supply chains. Costs spiked, margins compressed, but a year later, those tariffs become baseline. They're factored into pricing. Companies have adjusted. The year-over-year comparisons get easier because you're lapping the difficult period. That creates an optical improvement in earnings growth, even if nothing fundamental changed. Additionally, Fed cutting rates is straightforward bullish. Lower rates makes borrowing cheaper. They make future cash flows more valuable in present terms. They support asset prices. But the Fed only cuts if they think they can without triggering inflation. So Fed cuts in this environment signals confidence the economy can handle easier policy. That's different from the emergency cuts during a crisis. Tom's also saying energy is a top sector pick. Data centers running AI models are incredibly energy intensive. They need massive amounts of electricity and electricity generation can't scale overnight. So energy demand is spiking while supply is constrained. But Tom's clear that this isn't a rotation away from Mag 7. It's a rotation into an additional Mag 7. The big tech companies keep producing strong earnings growth. They're not falling apart. Their businesses aren't breaking. They just might not expand their valuation multiples. Instead, they grow their earnings and their stock prices should track those earnings. Meanwhile, energy stocks or financial stocks that have been trading at low multiples start getting revalued. Tom's forecast essentially says we rally first, then correct in the second half of the year, and then rally into the year end. If you enjoy this video, please consider subscribing.
