        "transcript": "Most investors that are looking for the next palunteer that are looking for great growth stocks in 2026 are all essentially looking at the same place. This is usually where returns go to die, where it get compressed and where people are essentially chasing the same 10 names. Palunteer is a perfect example of that. Nvidia is another. Now before you go and blame me of being a Palanteer or Nvidia bearer, I'm not. Palanteer is still my top holding in my own portfolio. It's not going to change. Nvidia is still a worldclass stock that needs to be in every top stocks list. That's not going to change. But look at it this way. Ever since we started investing in Palunteer, the stock went up 1678% as of the making of this video. Ever since we added Nvidia to our top stocks list in the academy, the stock is up, 1232%. But that was five years ago. It's not about what worked last year. It's not about what worked in 2021 or 2020 or for that matter any other year that is not 2026 because this is a whole new ball game. It's not going to help you if we talk about the great things that worked last year. This isn't about that. It's about how to win in 2026. Now, in this video, I'm going to give you five potential growth stocks for 2026 that are not super obvious, that are not super hyped, and that have yet had their Palunteer or Nvidia moments. These are great stocks with great fundamentals, with a lot of potential, with a lot of upside, but they have not exploded out of the stratosphere like Palenter Nvidia. Now before we go forward with the list, just a few caveats. Number one, this is not in any particular order. So don't read things into it that are not there. Number two, this is not about the best stocks ever. This is a list of five companies that are wonderfully positioned to do well in 2026 because they haven't had their Nvidia or Palanteer moment yet. They have strong fundamentals. This is not some hidden gem, you know, penny stock that nobody has ever heard about. That's not the point. Maybe there are other stocks that are just as great. Maybe they are better. That's not the point. These are the five that I like for 2026 because of all the elements I'll show in today's video. Now, the first stock on this list is called Vertive, Ticker SVRT. This is a $62 billion stock. We actually added to my top stocks list about 6 months ago. Overall, 2025 was pretty good. The stock has done well, but not parabolically, not like Nvidia in the good days, not like Palanteer over the past few years. It's still yet to have its insane explosive moment. Now, this is basically a company that sits on a very crucial bottleneck of the data center industry. They do immersive cooling. And as you should know by now, cooling and electricity are the biggest two bottlenecks of AI, of data centers. It's not so much about GPUs anymore. It's about how we power all these data centers, how we actually cool them. Basically, the infrastructure, the picks and shovels. Now essentially if compute continues to grow which seems to be the case and we have more data centers and we have denser data centers then vertive ticker VRT grows with it and as data centers grow the TAM the total addressable market by 2030 is expected to be somewhere in the vicinity of 70 to90 billion dollar per year. Currently VR is making about 9 billion per year. That increase in the TAM will certainly spill over into VRT being the gold standard of the industry. I'm expecting a 3 to 4x increase in the operating income of VRT in the next couple of years. Now, if you look at the fundamentals as it is today, it's pretty insane how good this company is being managed. It has 80% growth in revenue over the past two years. It's currently growing at about 28% per year. The free cash flow is up 440% over the past two years. and it's currently growing about 27%. And it basically shows you the scalability of this company. If we can grow free cash flow by 440% with an 80% growth rate on revenues, it shows the company squeezes more dollars out of the same dollar revenue. With a 34P, yes, I said it 330. It is an extremely low PE considering how good this company is, the industry it is in, the short interest is basically non-existent with 2.7%. and on stock MVP actually scores 80 out of 100 which is a very very high score. Number two on our list is Crowd Strike ticker CRWD. Now this is a cyber security company. We're talking about $17 billion company. It is a monster but still not to the level of the Nvidas of the world. It's up 165% since we added it to my top stocks list in 2021. Believe it or not, CrowdStrike, much like Vertive, owns about 20% of its own market, which is pretty insane. And with digital transformation, with the adoption of cloud, with data centers, and the increasingly sophisticated threats we're talking about right now, their Falcon platform becomes not just important, it becomes as missionritical as they come. And as AIdriven threats increase, essentially Crowd Strike becomes a must. And over the next five years, crowd is going to be even more important because as hackers get more sophisticated, they use AI. Now there's more vulnerabilities because of AI, because data center got digitization, everything. So crowd strike becomes more and more important as AI becomes a bigger part of our life. And the good thing is they operate on recurring revenue, which is one of the best things you want to have in the software business. Every year your clients pay you a fee. It's not a one-off. It's not project based. And as endpoint protection becomes more and more important, CrowdStrike makes more money. It's very, very simple. The total addressable market at the TAM by 2030 is expected to be 85 to 100 billion. Currently making about 6 billion per year, which is insane, but nowhere near the potential that we're talking about with 20 25 30% of the market by 2030. I actually see this company doing 6x on operating income in just a few years. Now, as far as fundamental go, it's pretty insane how good this company is. The revenue growth of the past three years is up 124%. It's currently growing at 22% per year. Free cash flow is up 95% the past three years. Debt is almost flat in three years and it's currently 1/5ifth of the cash position. At 144P, it's not cheap, but it is a company that just broke even. They just got over that hump. So the high forward P doesn't really reflect as much as you would think because they just became profitable. Give them a year or two, they'll certainly grow into that valuation. At 3% show interest, nobody's betting against the company. And the Crowd Strike stock MVP scorecard shows us an extremely impressive score. Number three on our list, AET. Now, AET is pretty insane. Arista. Now, it's a $165 billion company. Again, a monster, a big company. I didn't say it's a penny stock, but nowhere near the size of the big monsters that everybody's chasing right now. Now, ever since we added it to my top stocks list, it's up 228%. That was two and a half years ago. This year, it did 19%. Not bad. I mean, 19 is pretty good, but it's pretty much in line with the S&P 500. And it's not a wonderful year. It's a decent year again, just like the other two. It didn't have an explosive moment like the ones that we've seen with Palanteer and Nvidia. Now similar to the previous talks we talked about it holds about 20% of the market and essentially as companies building more and more AI data centers the connectivity inside those data centers the networking becomes more important that's where Arista dominates they basically sell this highspeed data center networking gear which you essentially can't have AI without and as comput scales Arista keeps on making more and more money in fact by 2030 the total market of networking for AI data center is supposed to be 50 to 60 billion a year. Currently, the company's making about 8 and a half per year, which is already pretty insane, but it's supposed to go a lot higher. I see a 2x to a 3x in operating income in a matter of years. And if you pop up in the hood, you know, the engine is quicky clean. 115% growth in revenue the past two years, currently growing at 28%. Free cash flow is up 538% in just two years. It's up 27% in 12 months. Debt at zero 10 billion of cash at 39 forward P. That's not expensive. And a score of 80 out of 100 on stock MP which is very impressive. Now I promised to deliver another cyber security company and I shall. The company is Zcaler. The ticker is ZS. And essentially, Ziscare is best described as the shift from the old firewalls of the '9s, the 2000s into cloudnative security. They are the best in the business. And while CrowdStrike does the first line of defense with laptops and servers, these guys exist on the cloud. They control and secure how users access the cloud and internet and use cloud-based platforms. is just as important. They actually are completing programs, completing services, completing companies. A lot of the clients of Crowd Strike use Zcaler and vice versa. And as you have more and more complexity, it will become more and more important because a cyber security screw-up as you've seen with the Cloud Strike little software update glitch can literally bring the world to a standstill. Not a good idea to have it. which means company will spend more and more it's non-discretionary on elite cyber security. Now by 2030 [snorts] I predict the TAM to be 70 to 80 billion per year. Currently Zcaler holds about 3 billion of that which means there's a lot of room to grow and if you look at the fundamentals revenue is up 133% the past 3 years they're currently growing at 23%. free cash flow is 850 million and expanding and stockp gives it a score of 75 out of 100 which is extremely solid. Next up we got Data Dog, ticker DD OG and don't go anywhere because after that we're going to talk about the three stocks you don't want to look at in 2026. Now Data Dog DOG is a company that provides monitoring and observation for cloud application. Essentially, you want to make sure that your cloud application is running correctly. And that's how they grew to $45 billion. Massive market cap, but nowhere near the potential. They're not on my list yet. We just added them along with Zcaler just a few days ago. And as AI becomes a bigger part of our life, as it becomes more complex, essentially the need for monitoring and visibility becomes mission critical, which is where data dog steps in which is why they have insane switching cost, which is why I think that by 2030, we're going to see a market about 60 to 70 billion. Currently, they're making about 3 billion per year. Lots of potential, but even the fundamentals are as solid as they come. Revenue growth of 109% over the past 3 years. You got growth of about 26% over the past year in revenues. Free cash flow is 940 million up 158% the past two years. Free cash flow margin of about 25% which is insane. 3x cash versus debt. Forward PE of 57, short interest below 3% and a stock MVP score of 75 out of 100. Another solid company with a lot of potential for 2026. And if you want the complete package, I actually have a list, a list of the top 15 AI stocks in the market right now. Go get it. It's in the description. It's free. Click the link, get the list. It's a gift from me to you. Now, let's talk about the overhyped trio I promised you in the beginning of this video. The first name of this list is EOS Energy, ticker EOS E. Now, this is one of the companies that have gained so much traction on social media banking on the fact that EOS becomes this massive major grid battery supplier as power demand explodes on data centers. I understand where the thesis is coming from. It's not absolutely, you know, removed from reality. But on the other hand, you know, the stock is up 134% in 2025. That is very hefty. Now, the short interest on the stock is almost 30%. It's extremely high. You've got a $3 billion market cap on a company that makes 60 million in sales. That's a 50x sales. That is insane. That's doubled in Nvidia. Now, net income in 2025 was -2 billion and they're bleeding about 250 million free cash flow. Debt is nine time versus cash with 450 over 50. share count grew by 300% over the past two years with massive dilution and the stock of AP score is 50 out of 100. Now maybe EOS becomes a great stock sometime in the future but right now it just insanely overvalued with not a lot of fundamentals to show for. Number two on this list is Big Bear ticker BB AI. This is supposedly the next palunteer with government contracts, defense spending AI and whatnot. And the stock is up 42% in 2025. The short interest is above 20%, extremely high. The revenues are down 7% in 2025. Net income in 2025 was negative 400 million. They're bleeding about 40 million per year in free cash flow. Share count grew by 254% over the past 3 years. And it's dominated by retail with about 65% retail ownership with massive insider selling. 37 million sold versus 2.5 million stock bought by insiders in 2025. And if you look at the stock MVP scorecard, which you shouldn't, the score is 25 out of 100. Number three on their list is a stock called Terraolf. The ticker is WLF. Now, this company essentially is a Bitcoin miner that's supposed to convert to data centers, AI. The story may be true. It may have logic, but looking at the fundamentals, it is extremely weak. The stock is up 133% in 2025. 29% short interest. Extremely high. Net income in 2025 was negative 560 million, bleeding almost 700 million a year in free cash flow. On top of this, the share count of the stock grew by 270% over the past three years and the stock MVP scorecard was 50 out of 100 a complete fail. Now, it doesn't mean these three stocks are not going to be great someday. It just means that given the run they had, I expected to see a lot more. And until I do with these fundamentals, woof, or should I say wolf. Now, if you hold one of these stocks, don't get offended. It's not about me being your friend. It's not me about being polite. It's not me about telling what you want to hear. It's me trying to give my honest opinion, which might be wrong, might be inaccurate, might be the complete ramblings of amendment. Who knows? But if you want to take the next step and learn with us how to find the next Nvidia, the next volunteer, just like we did in 2022, 2023, I actually suggest that you do it the right way. Invest in yourself, learn, get the education, take the long way, no shortcuts, and become a better investor for the long haul. To do that, we have a few spots open in the academy in the Rock Academy, patreon.com/dommnash. Would love to have you there. And as always, thank you so much and I'll see you in the next"
