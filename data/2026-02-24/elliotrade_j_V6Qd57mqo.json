    "transcript": "AI  is  destroying  everything  in  software,   including  Bitcoin.  $2  trillion  were   wiped  from  the  stock  market  in  software   stocks  in  just  a  month.  They're  calling   it  the  SAS  apocalypse.  And  the  same   money  that's  scared  of  software  right   now  that's  fleeing  all  things  digital  is   also  leaving  Bitcoin.  Not  because  AI  can   replace  Bitcoin.  It  literally  can't.  But   because  Wall  Street  has  put  Bitcoin  in   the  wrong  bucket.  And  right  now,  that   bucket  is  on  fire.  Now,  we  all  know  that   Bitcoin  started  crashing  in  October  of   2025.  But  what  you  might  not  realize  is   that  what  also  happened  in  October  was   the  release  of  a  very  powerful  AI  model,   which  has  led  to  something  that   Bloomberg  and  Jeffre  have  named  the  SAS   apocalypse.  That's  right.  You're  not   looking  at  the  chart  of  Bitcoin,  even   though  it  looks  scarily  similar.  This  is   actually  the  chart  for  the  iShares   expanded  tech  software  ETF  and  it's  down   an  astronomical  33%  since  October  of   2025  almost  exactly  mirroring  the  drop   that  Bitcoin  has  experienced  over  the   exact  same  time  period.  Palunteer  CEO   recently  went  on  TV  and  said  that   enterprise  software  is  going  to  be  made   irrelevant  because  AI  can  code  just  as   well  as  software  engineers.  And  the   market  did  not  debate  this.  It  just   sold.  And  that  set  off  a  chain  reaction   where  almost  every  single  day,  including   just  two  days  ago,  whenever  Claude  puts   out  some  new  feature  update,  including   this  one,  introducing  Cloud  Code   Security,  effectively  a  cyber  security   way  to  use  Claude  Code.  Guess  what   happens  immediately?  Crowd  Strike   Holdings  down  8%  immediately.  It's  very   clear  that  the  market  has  reached  a   conclusion.  If  it's  software,  AI  can  and   very  soon  will  come  to  kill  it.  And   that's  why  AI  is  killing  Bitcoin  because   as  we've  shown  you  on  recent  episodes,   the  tech  software  expanded  ETF  pretty   much  software  trades  directionally   almost  the  exact  same  as  Bitcoin.   Bitcoin  is  more  or  less  a  tech  stock  or   a  software  stock  as  far  as  Wall  Street   is  concerned.  So  now  that  AI  is  coming   to  absolutely  devour  the  software  as  a   service  sector  of  the  economy,  Bitcoin   is  simply  in  the  blast  radius.  And  if   you  add  to  it  the  uncertainty  of  the   United  States  facing  what  seems  like  an   imminent  conflict  with  Iran.  As  you  can   see,  we're  now  talking  about  Iran  being   a  week  away  from  producing  nuclear   weapons.  Where  have  we  heard  that   before?  As  well,  we're  starting  to  see   data  center  spending  start  to  eclipse   that  of  office  space  spending  for  the   first  time  in  history.  This  is   effectively  the  money  being  spent  on   compute  power  versus  the  money  being   spent  on  human  brain  power  in  the   professional  workplace  colorized  in   2026.  And  just  listen  to  this  comment   from  Sam  Alman  of  OpenAI.   >> One  of  the  things  that  is  always  unfair   in  this  comparison  is  people  talk  about   how  much  energy  it  takes  to  train  an  AI   model  relative  to  how  much  it  costs  a   human  to  do  one  inference  query.  But  it   also  takes  a  lot  of  energy  to  train  a   human.  It  takes  like  20  years  of  life   and  all  of  the  food  you  eat  during  that   time  before  you  get  smart.  And  not  only   that,  it  took  like  the  very  widespread   evolution  of  the  100red  billion  people   that  have  ever  lived  and  learned  not  to   get  eaten  by  predators  and  learned  how   to  like  figure  out  science  and  whatever   to  produce  you  and  then  you  took   whatever  you,  you  know,  you  took.  Now,   if  that  scared  you,  you  have  every  right   to  be  completely  freaked  out  because  now   we're  seeing  a  reframing  of  does  AI   waste  too  much  power?  Does  AI  consume   too  much  to  produce  a  unit  of  compute?   To  do  humans  consume  too  much  to  produce   a  unit  of  compute?  And  that,  my  friends,   is  a  moving  of  the  goalpost  that  we  have   not  experienced  yet  in  our  lives.  But   it's  a  sign  of  things  to  come  because   you  better  believe  that  we're  reaching   an  era  where  the  machines  are  going  to   be  able  to  compute  way  cheaper,  way   faster,  and  way  better  than  humans  have   ever  been  able  to.  Bear  in  mind,  we're   not  there  yet.  But  the  pace  of  progress   is  absolutely  staggering.  Just  take  one   look  at  this  chart.  Just  one  look.  What   you  see  here  is  an  exponential  that  is   going  into  full  hockey  stick  mode.  Okay?   You  see  the  pace  at  which  it  takes  an   LLM  to  reach  a  50%  success  rate  on  human   level  work.  And  you  see  now  it's   vertically  going  upwards  to  a  15  hours   of  human  work  with  a  50%  success  rate.   And  the  craziest  part  is  the  absolute   record-breaking  benchmark  of  GPT  5.2   high  happened  just  2  weeks  before  that.   So  in  the  space  of  what  feels  like  a  few   days,  we've  seen  this  benchmark   accelerate  many  multiples  from  about  4   hours  up  to  nearly  15  hours,  which  is   almost  a  4x.  It's  sometimes  hard  to   recognize  when  you're  in  the  midst  of   something  huge  happening.  But  it's  hard   to  deny  that  this  month  has  felt  like  a   major  inflection  point  in  the  AI   industry.  And  right  now,  it's  very  clear   that  people  who  are  forward-looking  are   trying  to  get  out  of  what  could  be  a   massive  train  wreck  as  AI  comes  to   devour  almost  everything  in  its  path.   Just  listen  to  this.   >> To  the  average  person,  I  would  say  get   your  board  in  the  water   and  prepare  to  paddle  like  all  get  out.   The  tsunami  of  a  lifetime  is  coming  and   nothing  your  elders  have  seen  is  going   to  prepare.   There's  no  good  advice  to  give  that's   specific.  Let's  put  it  this  way.  One  of   the  things  when  people  tell  me  about   they're  moving  from  one  city  to  another.   I  have  a  phrase  that  nobody  likes,  which   is  every  place  is  over.   Oh,  I'm  moving  to  Austin.  Yeah,  it's   over.  Miami,  it's  over.  Nashville  over.   You  know,  all  these  places  are  over.  And   every  occupation  that  is  named  is  over.   I'm  going  to  be  a  dentist,   radiologist,  accountant,   teacher.  These  are  all  over.   Whatever  is  coming,  get  flexible.  Get   good.  Get  good  on  a  bunch  of  different   stuff.   Learn  how  to  think  across  disciplines.  I   have  no  idea  what  what's  going  to  be   left  for  us,   but  you  know,  somebody's  going  to  come   out  on  top.  Now,  that  was  Eric   Weinstein,  managing  director  of  Teal   Capital.  Here's  the  deal  with  that.   Obviously,  in  my  opinion,  that's  peak   fear-mongering.  And  yes,  fear-mongering   can  be  fun,  but  right  now,  I  think   fear-mongering  is  very  useful  because   even  if  things  aren't  as  bad  as  we  think   they  might  be,  it's  important  that  you   understand  how  bad  people  think  it  could   be.  Because  markets  price  in  risk.  And   right  now  the  risk  that  AI  is  coming  to   absolutely  devour  sectors  of  the  economy   is  so  real  that  you  have  to  understand   and  visualize  this  almost  like  a   tsunami.  Like  the  economy  is  a  car   parked  on  the  train  tracks  and  the  train   is  coming  through.  And  you  need  to  ask   yourself,  do  you  want  to  be  sitting  in   the  car  that's  on  the  train  tracks?  Do   you  want  to  be  fishing  on  the  pier  when   the  tsunami  is  here?  Or  do  you  want  to   prepare  just  a  little  bit  and  try  to   understand  how  to  ride  the  wave?  Because   I  believe  there  are  ways  to  ride  the   wave.  I  believe  there  are  ways  to  make   sure  that  you  are  not  completely   destroyed  by  this.  But  there  is   absolutely  no  way  to  do  that  if  you   don't  acknowledge  the  reality  and   prepare.  Now  I  absolutely  love  this   because  what  happened  first  was  AI  came   for  software  development.  The  reason  why   is  that  software  development  is  what   fuels  the  AI  loop.  So  the  better  it  gets   at  software  development,  the  faster  AI   can  actually  move  and  develop  and   evolve.  So  of  course  software   engineering  was  the  very  first  thing   that  AI  optimized  to  try  to  solve  for.   Now  the  next  things  are  all  these  other   areas  and  as  Gary  Tan  here  the  creator   of  Y  Combinator  said  this  red  box  is   your  opportunity  right  these  are  the   areas  that  are  effectively  not  disrupted   yet  by  AI  and  don't  really  have  that   immediate  uptick  in  AI  adoption.  But   when  you  look  at  the  uncertainty  around   tech,  around  software,  you  look  at   geopolitical  uncertainty,  the  conflict   with  Iran,  you  look  at  all  the  way  that   our  allies  and  enemies  as  Americans  are   being  shuffled  around.  And  it's  very   clear  that  uncertainty  itself  is  the  one   thing  that  I  think  you  can  be  quite   certain  of,  which  is  why  the  gold  chart   looks  like  this.  And  as  you  know,  we've   been  bullish  gold  for  a  while,  and  we've   just  seen  gold  break  back  above  this  key   resistance  level  of  $5,100,  trying  to   make  its  way  back  up  to  test  this  prior   all-time  high  of  $5,600,  the  more   uncertain  the  world  gets,  and  the  less   reliable  things  like  equities,  which   have  been  extremely  easy  to  bet  on   throughout  the  post  great  financial  era   with  the  explosion  of  things  like   Facebook  and  Google  and  all  kinds  of  web   2  technology.  Well,  right  now  is  the   test.  And  as  people  get  uncertain,  the   case  for  why  you  should  own  some  gold   seems  to  be  expanding.  Gold  is  the   neutral  form  of  money  that  humanity  has   used  for  thousands  of  years.  And  in   times  like  this,  it  starts  to  look  real,   real  shiny.  So  I  want  to  talk  to  two   things.  First  of  all,  I  think  that  we   have  the  thing  right  now,  and  then  we   have  the  thing  behind  the  thing.  I  don't   think  anyone  is  coming  to  disrupt   physical  labor  jobs  for  quite  a  while.   We  let  the  nerds  take  over,  and  they   disrupted  themselves.  the  AI  nerds  kind   of  put  themselves  out  of  business   because  AI  companies  no  longer  really   need  software  engineers  or  they  won't  in   the  very  near  future.  So  software   engineers  in  some  ways  kind  of  owned   themselves.  A  real  self-destructive   move.  But  once  again,  if  you  have  a  good   personality  or  some  physical  skills  like   being  a  plumber,  an  electrician,  a   barber,  a  personal  trainer,  if  you  do   anything  in  the  physical  world,  I  think   your  job  is  pretty  safe  for  quite  a   while.  But  the  reality  is  that  there   could  be  a  thing  behind  this  thing  as  a   lot  of  the  economy  is  propped  up  by  the   actual  spending  going  on  by  the  elite   earners  within  the  technology  and   knowledge  work  space.  You  can't  just   expect  for  the  economy  to  keep  turning   if  doctors  and  lawyers  and  accountants   and  software  engineers  and  CEOs  and   managers  and  all  the  people  who  have   these  pretty  nice,  healthy,  cushy,   multi6figure  salary  jobs  just  get  put   out  of  work.  Well,  that's  going  to  have   a  huge  knock-on  effect  for  the  economy.   So,  you  can't  just  expect  for  everything   to  keep  ticking.  But  it's  important  to   realize  this  won't  happen  today.  I   believe  that  Bitcoin  is  being   miscatategorized  and  that  the  government   will  be  forced  to  hit  the  print  button   in  all  kinds  of  crazy  ways  in  the  not   too  distant  future.  Because  if  it's  true   that  a  huge  chunk  of  the  highest  paid   workers  in  America  get  put  out  of  work,   then  it's  also  true  that  the  velocity  of   money  in  the  United  States  will  slow   down  dramatically,  which  means  that  we   will  expect  not  inflation  but   significant  deflation.  And  that's   because  people  will  simply  stop  spending   money.  But  again,  these  are  further  out   consequences.  I  think  short  term  what   you  need  to  understand  is  that  Bitcoin   has  been  categorized  as  software  and   software  is  being  absolutely  rampaged  by   AI  because  the  inflection  in  the   capabilities  of  AI  has  been  so   significant  over  the  recent  few  months   that  markets  are  just  running  scared   from  anything  that  they  think  will  be   eaten  by  AIdriven  innovation.  Now,  I   want  to  be  clear,  patience  is  a  virtue   here,  but  you  don't  want  to  be  caught   overly  bearish  on  the  wrong  side  of  the   trade  because  at  the  bottom  here,  the   government  will  absolutely  need  to   print,  need  to  stimulate,  and  need  to   circulate  money  in  an  economy  that  is   rapidly  losing  velocity.  If  all  of  this   plays  out,  then  the  need  to  print  money   and  to  keep  people  happy  will  be  higher   than  ever.  And  that,  my  friends,  is  the   world  that  Bitcoin  was  absolutely  built   for.  And  that  is  absolutely  nothing  that   a  vibecoded  AI  software  can  do  about  it.   So,  while  I  am  absolutely  bearish   software  as  a  service  and  the  SAS   apocalypse  is  real,  I  believe  Bitcoin   has  been  unfairly  bucketed.  And  I  also   believe  that  this  is  opening  up  historic   buying  opportunities  whenever  the  rubber   truly  hits  the  road  here.  So,  hop  over   and  check  out  AI  Edg's  article  on   mastering  openclaw.  Check  out  OpenClaw,   which  is  the  AI  assistant  that  helps  you   really  leverage  AI  in  an  entirely  new   way.  I  highly  encourage  you  to  do  this   because  Open  Claw  is  the  way  to  start   getting  exponential  value  out  of  AI  and   learning  to  use  it  in  a  much  more  direct   and  impactful  way.  Now,  I  absolutely   love  this  tweet  here  uh  by  Miles  who   created  AI  Edge.  Here's  the  population   of  the  world  and  each  dot  is  3.2  million   people.  Now,  the  gray  has  never  used  AI.   That's  the  vast  majority  of  the  world.   The  green  have  used  a  free  chatbot  tier,   right?  So,  haven't  even  paid  for  AI.  The   yellow  or  the  orange  right  down  here  has   used  AI  premium,  which  as  you  can  see  is   a  fraction  of  one  of  these  lines.  And   the  red  are  users  that  are  actually   coding  with  AI.  So  if  you  have  ever  even   paid  for  the  premium  tier  of  AI,  you  are   in  the  super  super  top.3%.   And  if  you  have  coded  with  AI,  which  I'm   encouraging  you  all  to  at  least  mess   around  with  these  tools,  you  are  in  the   04%.  You  are  extremely  extremely  early.   Now,  of  course,  if  you're  terminally   online  like  I  am,  and  like  a  lot  of   people  who  invest  in  crypto  and  high   velocity  assets  are,  it  might  feel  like   you're  already  late  to  AI.  Like  all  of   these  things  have  already  moved  and   processed  so  quickly.  The  truth  is,  you   are  not.  You  are  in  the  top  1%  of  the  1%   of  the  entire  world.  And  all  you  have  to   do  is  keep  going.  Because  as  confusing   as  this  moment  is,  we  are  at  the   forefront  of  one  of  the  biggest  changes   in  the  history  of  our  world.  And  after   AI  comes  the  robotics,  the  embodied  AI   movement.  We're  going  to  be  talking   about  how  to  get  ahead  and  invest  in   things  that  won't  be  disrupted  by  AI.   We're  going  to  be  talking  about  the  ways   to  benefit  from  the  AI  trade  that   haven't  yet  become  obvious  or  things   that  have  become  more  accurately  priced.   And  most  of  all,  we're  going  to  be   making  sure  that  when  the  time  is  right,   we  absolutely  jump  two  feet  in  to   Bitcoin  because  it  has  become   undervalued  in  a  world  where  software   has  become  plentiful  and  everywhere,   Bitcoin  remains  scarce  and  finite.  If   you  guys  like  this  episode,  make  sure  to   click  on  this  one  popping  up  right  now   as  I'm  sure  you'll  love  it  too.  and  I   will  see  you  very  soon  on  the  next",
