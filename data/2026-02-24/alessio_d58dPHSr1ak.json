And  in  a  way,  it's  better   to  wait  for  that  and  not  get  in  rather   than,  you  know,  just  try  and  have  a  go   now  and  be  50%  down.  It  may  produce  so   much  more  panic  and  fear  in  the  crypto   community  in  the  XRP  community  that  they   may  just  capitulate.   All right,  guys.  Hello  and  welcome.   Today  we're  going  to  talk  about  XRP.  So,   the  crypto  which  is  loved  by  a  lot  of   people  out  there  has  suffered  severe   decline.  By  the  way,  this  was  by  no   means  a  surprise.  If  you  recall  back  in   February  of  2025,  about  a  year  ago,  I   warned  that  XRP  when  it  rallied  higher,   uh,  and  I'll  I'll  put  the  chart  so  you   guys  can  see  it.  When  XRP  was  rallying,   I  I  warned  about  several  important   danger  signs,  uh,  and  I'll  put  the  clip   for  you  guys  so  you  can  see  it.  The  MACD   on  XRP  on  the  weekly  chart  has  now  gone   over  again  extreme  levels  that  it  hit  in   2021  and  2018.  In  case  you're  wondering,   well,  so  what?  Well,  it  just  so  happened   that  those  extreme  MACD  momentum   readings  coincided  with  tops  in  the   price  of  XRP.  As  we  can  see  there,  it  is   a  warning  sign.  It  could  be  a  warning  of   a  potential  pullback  in  the  price  as   well.  Uh  there  were  several  warning   signs  about  MACD  overbought  conditions.   In  fact,  I'll  put  them  on  the  chart.  So,   let's  have  a  look  at  those  particular   charts  uh  one  more  time.  As  we  can  see   here,  last  year  I  warned  uh  when  XRP   there  it  is.  As  a  matter  of  fact,  in   February  of  last  year,  I  warned  that   we'd  seen  extreme  MACD  overbought   conditions  and  indeed  we  also  had   acceleration  extremes  in  uh  February  of   last  year.  So,  acceleration  extreme  and   MACD  overbought  conditions  and  in  the   past  whenever  those  had  occurred  again   acceleration  extremes  for  example  with   overbought  MACD  back  in  2021  I  think  it   was  then  it  followed  the  top  and  then  a   major  decline  major  crash.  Same  thing   happened  by  the  way  in  the  year  2017   2018  acceleration  extreme  when  market   moves  too  far  too  fast  goes  parabolic   with  MACD  overbought  conditions  and  yeah   we  had  top  followed  by  decline  I  warned   about  this  February  of  last  year  and  by   the  way  what  was  the  response  I  got   people  were  saying  Allessia  doesn't  know   what  he's  talking  about  he's  against  XRP   he  doesn't  believe  in  XRP  and  all  that   stuff  that's  why  I  warned  about  it  and   it  turns  out  as  we  can  see  here  I  was   absolutely  correct  XRP  P.  Again,  not  to   blow  my  own  horn  too  much  here,  but  XRP   did  eventually  decline  and  after  making   what  appears  to  be  an  ABC  decline.   Again,  we  had  a  Bwave,  a  bull  trap  right   there,  that  Bwave  was  a  bull  trap.  Then   we  had  a  C-wave  decline.  And  I  again,   let  me  just  make  sure  I  mention  this.   I'm  not  saying  that  the  C-wave  of  this   ABC  correction,  potential  ABC  correction   has  bottomed.  So,  by  no  means  am  I   saying  we've  reached  a  bottom  here  just   because  I  put  this  ABC  pattern  there.   There  may  still  be  potentially  more   downside  risk.  Again,  XRP  may  still  see   a  further  decline.  And  I'm  going  to  ask   Zach  his  opinion  about  this.  But  for  me,   I'm  seeing  this  overall  pattern  from  the   highs  of  uh  last  year  really  is  part  of   a  larger  degree  ABC  corrective  pattern,   a  larger  degree  correction.  Okay.  with   the  C-wave  almost  reaching  a  green  line.   It's  a  200  simple  moving  average  there   on  the  weekly  chart,  which  as  we  know   the  200  weekly  is  an  important  support   level.  So  far,  XRP  has  held  it.  But   again,  just  because  XRP  has  bounced  off   from  that  level  or  near  that  level,  it   doesn't  mean  we  reached  a  bottom  for  me.   Well,  we'll  discuss  this  in  a  few   minutes,  but  XRP  would  have  to  break   above  resistance  confirmation  with   Bitcoin  as  well  before  we  can  say  that   there's  a  bottom  in  place.  But  at  the   moment  there  is  no  indication  there  is   no  high  probability  indication  of  a   bottom.  So  XRP  could  potentially  see   more  downside  risk  despite  any  kind  of  a   bounce  in  the  short  term.  Uh  and  I  want   to  ask  Zach  now  what  his  view  is  about   this  overall  pattern.  Zack,  do  you  think   that  if  XRP  was  to  drop  below  $1,  let's   say  if  it  were  to  drop  below  $1,  uh  that   that  may  potentially  produce  perhaps?   We'll  have  to  see.  First  of  all,  do  you   think  below  $1  is  even  a  probability  uh   for  XRP  at  the  moment?   >> Yeah,  I  think  I  think  it  is  just  because   you've  got  uh  that  we  got  two  things.   One,  the  failure  below  the  a  the  Awave   low.   >> So,  say  that's  150  or  whatever  it  is.   And  then  because  the  um  you  know,  the   old  July  23  uh  low  is  potentially  new   support.  So  I  think  it's  a  bit  like  the   other  cryptos  that  you  even  though  if   they're  not  there's  not  going  to  be   another  new  leg  to  the  downside  at  the   moment  it's  giving  the  impression   there'll  be  one  final  move  to  the   downside  and  in  a  way  it's  better  to   wait  for  that  and  not  get  in  rather  than   you  know  just  try  and  have  a  go  now  and   be  50%  down  which  is  not  a  nice  uh  not  a   nice  place  to  be.  Yeah,  I  think  you  make   a  good  point  there  and  it  would  be   psychologically  speaking  as  well.  If  XRP   was  to  make  another  leg  lower,  let's  say   close  to  $1  or  below  it,  it  may  produce   so  much  more  panic  and  fear  in  the   crypto  community,  in  the  XRP  community,   that  they  may  just  capitulate  and  we'll   have  to  see,  of  course.  Guys,  make  sure   you  go  and  follow  Zack  on  X.  He  posts  a   lot  of  informative  and  interesting   material  on  his  X  account.  Uh  that's   TradersCafe.  I'll  put  the  link  for  you   guys  in  the  description.  What  would  have   to  happen  for  you  to  say  that  has  this   bottomed  given  the  current  chart  we  have   at  the  moment?  For  me,  I'd  put  1.77   there.  $1.77  as  a  resistance.  If  I  saw   if  that  is  XRP  was  to  get  above  $1.77,   then  I  would  say  perhaps  we  we  may  have   a  bottom  in  place.  Provided  Bitcoin   confirms  that.  By  the  way,  what  would   have  to  happen  for  you  to  say,  you  know   what,  XRP  probably  has  has  bottomed?  Uh   just  so  just  an  end  weekly  close  above   that  a  um  awave  low  there.  So  but  that's   150  or   >> Oh  I  see.  Yeah.  Yeah.  160  150.   >> Yeah.  Okay.  So  a  weekly  close  above  that   I  switch   >> which  is  possible  given  given  the  way   that  we've  had  quite  a  you  know  that   just  one  day  dip  towards  that  moving   average  and  we're  back  up  again.  Right.   There  was  you  know  blink  and  you  missed   it  right.  So  that  is  at  least  on  the   face  of  it  a  positive.  I  don't  know if   it  went  it  touched  the  line  or  went   below  it  or  whatever  it  is,  but   >> yeah,  I  came  very  close  to  it.  Yeah.   >> Yeah.  Yeah.  So,  if  it  came  very  close  to   it  and  didn't  touch  it,  I  think  that   that  is  that's  a  cork  and  water  rebound.   Uh  a  good  show  of  strength.  I  mean,   especially  given  we've  already  collapsed   from  the  highs.   >> Yeah.  I  mean,  there  probably  some  people   going  to  say  in  the  comment  section  of   this  video  that  XRP  is  doomed  and  it's   probably  going  to  go  back  to  the  50   cents  level.  Uh,  like  the  lows  of  2024   near  38  cents  or  40  cents.  Personally,  I   think  it's  unlikely,  but  you  never  know.   But  it's  I  think  it's  unlikely.  But  is   that  what's  your  view  on  that?  I'm  just   I'm  probably  just  focused  on  the  the  the   support  ideally  ideally  for  everyone   support  comes  in  towards  the  um  the  $1   area  and  I  think  everyone  would  be  happy   with  that.  You  know,  there's  one   >> $1  level.  Yeah.   >> Yeah.  $1  level.  Yeah.  I  think  that's   that's  probably  the  the  ideal  scenario   worth  waiting  for.  And  unless  you're   very  keen,  you  just  wait  for  an  end  of   the  end  of  week  close  back  above  the  uh   that  a  low  then  then  those  are  the  two   choices  you  have.  If  you're  keen,  you   you  just  wait  for   restoring  uh  the  old  support.  And  if  you   are  more  trying  to  be  more  opportunist,   you  just  wait  to  see  if  you can  get   anywhere  near  a  dollar.  Uh  I  think  you'd   feel  relatively  safe  there.  Um  and  you   might  do  well  quite  quickly.   >> Again,  just  a  reminder,  this  video  is  by   no  means  a  recommendation  to  buy  or  sell   XRP  on  any  crypto.  Uh  it's  just  purely   for  educational  purposes.  But  again,   it's  interesting  uh  what  Zach  says  here.   Yeah,  I  think  Zach,  I  got  a  question   here.  I  mean,  assuming  assuming  the  ABC   pattern  completes,  assuming  the  C-wave   bottoms  out,  let's  say,  not  that  doesn't   have  to  be  now,   >> but  let's  say  it  makes  another  leg  lower   or  let's  say  it  bottoms  out  in  the  next   several  weeks  and  months,  maybe  spring   or  maybe  later  on.  Um,  let's  do  you   think  a  big  bounce  or  a  rally  is   probable?  Uh,   >> I  think  if  you  look  back  at  the  ch  you   look  back  at  the  chart  over  recent   years,  it  looks  like  a  heart  trace   monitor.  So  you  could  never  you  could   never  rule  out  a  a  massive  spike  to  the   upside.  That  is  the  that's  what  the   chart  is  telling  you  that  it's   >> periods  of  quietness  and  gloom  and  doom   and  then  all  of  a  sudden  there's  a   vertical  move   >> um  which  lasts  for  a  few  months  and  then   we're  back  down  again.  So  it's  that  kind   of  it's  a  heart  race  monitor  type  chart.   >> Yeah,  it  is  very  very  um  volatile.  So   yeah,  so  that's  why  uh  if  you  you  find  a   level  you  know  you're  comfortable  with   or  wait  for  a  level  that  comfortable   with  that  that's  why  um  it's  something   that  if  you're  comfortable  there  and   there's  not  too  much  um  the  markets  not   doesn't  go  too  much  against  you  from   that  level  then  I  think  this  is  a  market   that  can  you  know  would  have  good   rewards  you  know  that's  why  it's  got  its   uh  legions  of  fans.   >> Yeah  it  does.  But  just  to  keep  this   point,  uh  I  think  XRP  again  as  as  yet   there's  no  sign  of  a  bottom  as  mentioned   before  despite  the  fact  that  we've   reached  some  support  level  despite   oversold  conditions.  Uh  we  have  to   remember  there's  always  risk  of   potential  more  declines  uh  of  a  further   drop.  And  you  know  what?  Anything  is   possible.  Anything  can  happen.  So  thanks   very  much  indeed,  Zach.  I  really   appreciate  it.  Guys,  do  go  ahead  and   check  out  Zack  on  X.  Follow  him  there.   Zack's  Traders  Cafe  is  his  X  handle.

Figyelmeztetett arra, hogy az XRP mostani jelzései végső csökkenést jeleznek. Megemlíti a MACD mutatót, amely már korábban is figyelmeztetett a túlhevült állapotokra, és azt keresi, hogy az XRP elérte-e már az alját. Az 1,77 dolláros szint átlépése jelezheti a fordulópontot.
