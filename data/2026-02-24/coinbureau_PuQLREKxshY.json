    "transcript": "If you've been in crypto for more than a few  days, then you may well have heard the term   paper Bitcoin being thrown around. Paper  Bitcoin refers to investments that give   indirect exposure to Bitcoin, such as futures,  ETFs, and even balances held on exchanges. Now,   many have alleged that there's more paper Bitcoin  than real BTC backing it. And these claims include   Black Rockck not holding the BTC it claims backs  its ETF, Michael Sailor not actually buying   billions in BTC, or that crypto exchanges don't  have enough BTC to honor withdrawals. At the same   time, critics say paper Bitcoin has an outsized  influence on BTC's price, much like derivatives   do in other markets like precious metals. That's  why today we're diving deep into paper Bitcoin,   including what it is and how it could impact BTC's  price as it becomes more common. My name is Guy   and you're watching the Coin Bureau. So then, what  exactly are paper assets anyway? Well, in short,   it's whenever someone invests in an asset  without directly touching the asset itself. So,   take gold for example. In case you didn't know,  most gold trading happens through paper contracts   such as futures, options, forwards, ETFs, and  unallocated accounts. In other words, most gold   traders aren't buying physical gold, just paper  contracts that give exposure to gold's price.   Just like with paper gold, paper Bitcoin refers  to BTC exposure gained through futures contracts,   options, and derivatives based ETFs and trusts.  All of which allow investors to trade BTC's price   action without actually owning the underlying BTC  directly. And if you don't count crypto exchanges,   paper Bitcoin has technically been around  since December 2017. This was when the Chicago   Merkantile Exchange or CME launched Bitcoin  futures, marking the first time institutional   investors could trade BTC on a regulated exchange.  Now, of course, this is pretty common today,   but back then, this was a hugely bullish step that  reshaped the future of the crypto market. In fact,   its initial launch just happened to coincide  with the very peak of the 2017 bull market.   Coincidence? I think not. But back to the  crypto exchanges. In Bitcoin's earliest years,   several crypto exchanges were known to operate in  ways that ultimately left users unable to access   their BTC. Take Mount Gox, which once handled  roughly 80% of Bitcoin trades globally, and which   infamously collapsed in 2014 after losing hundreds  of thousands of BTC through hacks, mismanagement,   and accounting failures. Customers who trusted  the exchange with their funds were left with   paper Bitcoin, basically IUS, which resulted in  huge losses. But Mount Gox wasn't alone. Bitcoin   was another exchange suffering repeated hacks  in 2012, losing tens of thousands of BTC. Bit   floor was hacked in 2012 as well and eventually  closed down, while Bitfinex was relieved of around   120,000 BTC in 2016. And of course, there was the  now defunct FTX, which infamously used customer   money for trades and investments and even company  expenditures and political donations. Meanwhile,   its loyal customer base was left with paper  account balances that ultimately meant nothing.   But how does any of this relate to paper Bitcoin?  Well, all of these incidents share one thing in   common. Customer balances were credited on  exchange ledgers, but the BTC wasn't actually   there. Essentially, users were holding paper  balances of BTC rather than anything verifiable   on chain. Naturally, this has fueled controversy  around paper Bitcoin that continues to this day.   And if you want to keep up with developments  around paper bitcoin and indeed the rest of   the crypto market, then you need to know about  the coin bureau's telegram channel. That's where   we share the latest breaking news, provide deep  dive alpha, and give you the most important market   updates, all pinged directly to your device so you  don't miss a thing. So, if that sounds good, then   sign up today using the link in the description  or the QR code on screen now. Okay, as you've   probably gathered, paper Bitcoin is manifested in  a number of ways. The first and largest category   is via crypto exchanges which are estimated to  hold around 15% of BTC's total supply according   to glass node. Now crypto exchanges are perhaps  the most notorious category of paper Bitcoin   issuer because there has long been skepticism that  exchanges have the BTC on hand to honor customer   withdrawals which wouldn't be all that surprising  given the sector's history of hacks and scams.   But it wasn't until after the collapse of FTX  that exchanges started doing proof of reserves.   As the name suggests, proof of reserves provides  onchain evidence that exchanges actually hold the   crypto that they claim to. Proof of reserves  has its own shortfall, such as exchanges not   regularly updating these balances, but it's better  than nothing and a big step towards transparency.   Regardless, the second largest category of paper  Bitcoin issuer is the Bitcoin ETFs. At the time   of shooting, these ETFs collectively hold almost  1.6 million BTC, roughly 7% of the total supply.   As some of you will know, ETFs hold shares in  a regulated fund that track BTC's price and are   managed mainly by asset managers like Black  Rockck and Fidelity. It's a compliant way to   gain exposure with just a ticker and a brokerage  account. No self-custody risk, no private keys,   and no onchain monitoring required. And therein  lies the problem. Spot Bitcoin ETF issuers have   not disclosed their Bitcoin wallet addresses. This  makes it hard to verify if they actually hold the   BTC that is supposed to back their ETF shares.  Although granted, some third-party platforms   like Arkham Intelligence have discovered some  of their wallets, so it's not all fairy dust,   which is certainly good news. Whatever the case,  the third largest category of paper Bitcoin issuer   is Bitcoin Treasury companies. As I record this,  they collectively hold 1.1 million BTC, or roughly   5% of the total supply. If you've been keeping up  with the crypto space in recent years, you'll know   the world's largest Bitcoin treasury company  is Strategy, formerly Micro Strategy, which   started buying BTC in 2020. This made Strategy the  first Bitcoin treasury company, inspiring hundreds   of other companies to follow suit. But how does  this fall under the paper Bitcoin category? Well,   these companies frequently add BTC to their  holdings as part of their business. Now,   when investors buy shares in these companies,  they're betting on the company's success, not the   underlying BTC. Essentially, they're investing in  the holder, not the holdings. And not only that,   but just like spot Bitcoin ETF issuers, most  Bitcoin treasury companies have not disclosed   their wallet addresses, not even Strategy. This is  a little concerning, especially when you consider   that there have been lots of questions about why  Strategy's big Bitcoin buys have recently had   next to zero impact on BTC's price. Some have  alleged that this is because no actual BTC is   being bought. And on that note, the fourth largest  category of paper Bitcoin issuer is governments.   As most of you will know, several governments  are supposedly sitting on their own national   stockpiles of BTC, either due to seizures, state  mining, or strategic reserve policies. But again,   it's not clear how much BTC they actually hold, as  guess what? Few governments have disclosed their   wallet addresses. Now, the US is the foremost  state Bitcoin holder with supposedly 328,000 BTC,   followed by China with 190,000 BTC and the UK  with 61,000 BTC. In total, governments hold   about 646,000 BTC or roughly 3% of Bitcoin's total  supply. And what makes this category truly unique   though is that it's paper Bitcoin at the state  level with the potential to shape geopolitical   narratives or indeed influence monetary policy.  Now the fifth category of paper Bitcoin issuer is   DeFi, specifically BTC on other chains. Now this  mostly takes the form of so-called wrapped bitcoin   that involves creating an ERC20 token supposedly  backed by actual BTC. These wrapped Bitcoin tokens   like WBTC or Coinbase's CBTC are then used  for borrowing, lending, liquidity mining,   or yield farming. Now, unlike other forms of paper  BTC, most wrapped Bitcoin protocols do offer proof   of reserves, which makes it possible to verify  that the BTC is actually there. At the time   of shooting, wrapped Bitcoin protocols hold over  380,000 BTC, just under 2% of the total supply. So   why does wrapped BTC count as paper Bitcoin? Well,  you basically hand BTC to a custodian expecting to   redeem it one for one later on. This redemption  may not be guaranteed, though, and as we've   learned, even proof of reserves isn't perfect. the  BTC backing these wrapped tokens might not always   be there. So, now that we've covered the various  types of paper Bitcoin, you might wonder how it   all affects BTC's price. Well, the short answer is  that it's had a very positive impact both directly   and indirectly. That's because paper Bitcoin has  made BTC more accessible, attracting significantly   more capital. But to truly understand Paper  Bitcoin's importance, let's take a look at the   impact of each category we just covered. Starting  with exchanges. Now, exchanges support BTC's price   by making it possible for more investors to buy  it, which requires a bit of context. You see,   before Mount Gaus launched in 2010, people mined  BTC when mining was much easier or bought it   directly from others on a peer-to-peer basis. Safe  to say, exchanges have made buying BTC far simpler   and safer, and exchanges have since evolved to  provide a whole bunch of tools and investment   products like futures, which are essential for  price discovery. Without them, BTC trading would   be illquid, fragmented, and Bitcoin and indeed  crypto as a whole might have long been forgotten.   But you'll recall that the first real paper  Bitcoin emerged with the CME Bitcoin futures   in 2017. Now, obviously, the CME Bitcoin futures  didn't have a direct impact on BTC's price since   they didn't involve investing in the underlying  asset. However, they did have an indirect effect,   which was to legitimize Bitcoin and crypto more  broadly as an asset class worthy of institutional   attention. And whereas the 2017 bull market ended  with paper Bitcoin with the CME futures listing   marking the top, the 2021 bull market began  with paper Bitcoin. That's because Strategy   made its first $250 million purchase of BTC on  the 11th of August 2020, becoming the first ever   Bitcoin treasury company. As such, you could say  Strategy's paper Bitcoin had a direct and indirect   impact on BTC's price. It had a direct impact  because strategy was buying actual BTC and it   had an indirect impact which was to further  increase Bitcoin's legitimacy in the eyes of   investors. It's a similar story with the 2024 bull  market which was kicked off by the listing of the   spot Bitcoin ETFs. By now you'll know that the  ETFs were by far the most bullish paper Bitcoin   category. They were instrumental in helping push  BTC's price to its historic high of $126,000. Now,   broadly speaking, when spot ETFs experience  heavy inflows, BTC's price goes up. And when   there's heavy outflows, BTC's price goes down. And  with net outflows starting in October last year,   well, BTC has basically been tanking ever since.  As for the governments, meanwhile, they haven't   necessarily had a direct impact on BTC since  most of the BTC they hold was seized rather than   purchased. El Salvador and a few other countries  notwithstanding. That said, though, governments   indirectly impact BTC's price by reducing its  liquid circulating supply. With fewer coins   available on exchanges, basic supply and demand  dynamics take over. If supply drops while demand   stays constant or rises, prices go up. Continuing  to hold BTC also sends a signal to some that these   governments believe Bitcoin is worth holding  as they would have otherwise sold. And speaking   of which, some countries have done exactly that  with Germany infamously selling its BTC in 2024.   And when it comes to the wrapped paper Bitcoin,  it has had a subtle but direct effect on BTC   by making it easier for investors to use it as  collateral for loans. This has likely resulted   in less BTC sales around the margin as investors  will borrow against it instead of selling it.   The catch though is that when markets are volatile  like they've been recently, this DeFi leverage can   create lots of liquidations. Now, over the years,  paper Bitcoin has sparked plenty of controversy   with some debating whether it could eventually  undermine Bitcoin itself. In most cases,   allegations center on companies claiming to hold  BTC that they might not actually have. The main   target of these allegations has been strategy.  Now, we all know that Michael Sailor is probably   Bitcoin's biggest permeable, obsessed with buying  as much BTC as humanly possible. As I record this,   his company holds well over 700,000 BTC, which is  a truly mind-boggling amount. However, skepticism   has grown over whether Strategy really holds the  BTC it claims to, with many asking for proof of   reserves. What's scary, though, is that Strategy  has repeatedly refused, citing security concerns,   fears that routine movements could spook the  market, and a handful of other reasons besides.   Now, while this reasoning does actually make  some sense, it's also just added fuel to the   fire. Some critics even claim the company has been  buying Bitcoin derivatives or rehypothecating its   BTC. And for those unfamiliar, rehypothecation is  when a custodian or exchange reuses its held BTC   as collateral or for lending, creating multiple  paper claims on the same asset. In other words,   some critics alleged that Strategies BTC  is tied up in loans or collateral rather   than held directly in wallets under the  company's control. Anyhow, these questions   have continued to resurface, leading Sailor to  respond in January this year by saying, quote,   \"We buy real Bitcoin. We audit our custodians. We  don't rehypothecate. You shouldn't either.\" Now,   as mentioned earlier, some of Strategy's  holdings have been tracked across multiple   wallets by onchain analysis firms like Arkham.  That said though, the accuracy of this tracking   isn't 100%. And at least 110,000 BTC remain  unaccounted for. To be clear, though, this   doesn't mean Strategy doesn't hold it, just that  it hasn't been identified by onchain sleuths yet.   Now, as you can imagine, another top target of  allegations related to paper Bitcoin have been   the spot bitcoin ETFs. In late 2023, before this  first spot ETF even hit the market, some were   skeptical about whether these funds like Black  Rockck's iBit would actually hold the BTC they   claim to, especially given that custodial wallet  addresses weren't publicly provided. However,   these questions were quickly answered by Bloomberg  ETF analyst James Seafart, who reassured us that   quote, \"Cash creation does not mean the fund won't  hold spot Bitcoin or that a Bitcoin ETF will be a   fractional reserve product,\" adding that quote,  \"the funds will hold spot Bitcoin.\" And just to   put everyone's mind at ease, Black Rockck's BTC  stash can also be spotted on Arkham, which clearly   shows them holding over 756,000 BTC, the same  amount backing IBIT. But again, these wallets   have not been officially verified or disclosed.  Third parties had to find them. And more recently,   there have been accusations made against Coinbase  with critics accusing it of selling paper Bitcoin   to BlackRock. This allegation was addressed  by Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong in an AMA call   last month, asserting that the BTC they've been  selling is real. And similarly, there have been   concerns that companies handling paper Bitcoin  could be hacked or exploited. And to be fair,   history shows us this could indeed happen. Recall  that Mount Gaus and Bitfinex are just two examples   of exchanges that ran into difficulties after  mishandling the funds needed to back customer   deposits. If something similar were to happen  today, like a major custodian being hacked,   it would spark market chaos. BTC would likely  tank, not just from compromised BTC being sold,   but because it would shake confidence among  investors that the current custodial setups   are secure. Incidentally, this is something  that Arthur Hayes discussed with us during an   interview back in June 2024. In his words, quote,  \"If I think about the two to threeyear risk,   I would say a major crypto custodian gets hacked  and loses $50 billion to 100 billion in crypto   and that would be the end of the cycle.\" And by  the way, you can watch that full interview in the   video right here if you're interested. So then  how will paper Bitcoin shape the crypto market   going forward? Well, while it may carry the risks  we just discussed, those concerns are deeprooted   in Bitcoin's earlier years when custodians and  exchanges weren't nearly as reputable or as secure   as they are today. These days, paper Bitcoin plays  a key role in supporting the crypto ecosystem with   ETFs driving both adoption and BTC's price  action. Now, of course, in an ideal world,   every crypto enthusiast would fully control their  own private keys 100% of the time rather than   use exchanges as trusted custodians. After all,  self-custody embodies the very ethos of Bitcoin.   True ownership, censorship, resistance, and the  protection against counterparty risk. The problem,   though, is self-custody remains a huge barrier  for mainstream adoption. Managing private keys is   often seen as complex and intimidating, especially  for non-technical users. Mistakes can be costly,   and lost keys result in permanently lost funds.  Thankfully though, wallets are becoming more   userfriendly. They can be set up in minutes, and  many now have features that aim to abstract away   as much complexity as possible. And best of all,  this security doesn't have to cost you an arm and   a leg. And if you're really not sure where to  start, then don't worry. We've got you covered   because you'll find plenty of wallet comparisons  on the Coin Bureau website and even discounts on   some of the best ones. Link in the description.  But maybe you want an alternative to paper Bitcoin   that offers more versatility than BTC itself.  Well, one option you could consider is wrapped   Bitcoin, which you'll recall opens the door to  DeFi use cases. For instance, you could earn a   yield with it and reinvest to buy more BTC. And  best of all, wrapped BTC reserves are transparent   and verifiable on chain, unlike paper Bitcoin,  which is inherently opaque. As the saying goes,   don't trust, verify. And then once you're ready,  you could simply redeem your wrapped Bitcoin for   actual BTC. Sort of like showing your receipt  to get a refund. What's crazy though is that   you can now do this if you hold shares in Bitcoin  ETFs because in July last year, the SEC approved   paper Bitcoin ETF shares to be exchanged one to  one for the physical BTC backing them. Obviously,   this is a fairly recent development, but logic  suggests that we could see similar things   happening with other paper Bitcoin derivatives in  the future, and this mechanism could even serve   as a template for other markets such as precious  metals. For example, gold ETF shares could one   day be exchanged for the actual gold backing the  fund. In other words, traditional markets could   be massively improved. All thanks to the example  set by crypto, which is when you say it out loud,   kind of ironic. All right, folks. That's all  for today's video. But if you want to see why   strategy may be under threat, then check out the  video right over here. And if you want to see how   Trump's DeFi protocol may have signaled the bare  market, then check out the video over here. Okay,   thank you all for watching and I'll see  you again soon. This is Guy signing off.",
