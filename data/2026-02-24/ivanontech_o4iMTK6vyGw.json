    "transcript": "And  we  do  have  Mayday,  Mayday,  Mayday   for  all  of  the  Bitcoin  bulls.  It's  big,   big,  fat,  juicy  Mayday  in  front  of  us.   That's  exactly  what  we're  seeing.   Bitcoin  is  now  back  banging  on  the  door   of  the  buy  zone.  As  you  can  see,  it  is   now  entering  the  buy  zone  basically   right  above  the  buy  zone.  And  it's  very,   very,  very  good  for  us.  Why?  Because   we've  been  expecting  this.  And  we   actually  expect  us  to  go  quite  uh  lower   into  the  buy  zone  to  approximately  40k.   But  nibbling  extremely  slowly  here  maybe   1%  per  week  or  something  like  that  of   your  capital  that  you  want  to  invest.  It   is  smart  because  it  is  close  to  200  week   moving  average.  Historically  if  you   nibble  around  200  moving  average  is   fantastic  fantastic  fantastic  fantastic.   So  everything  is  exact.  Also  I  want  to   remind  you  guys  that  we  do  have  a  free   newsletter.  Let  me  just  show  you  what  we   sent  here  on  Sunday  is  this  one  is   actually  fully  fully  free.  You  can  go  in   the  in  the  description  and  you're  going   to  see  newsletter.  sign  up  for   newsletter  because  on  Sunday  I  uh  sent   this  newsletter  saying  that  we  are   breaking  support  and  we're  going  to  be   flashed  towards  58.  At  that  point   Bitcoin  was  like  6  67  68  69  70K  and  it   was  just  Sunday  guys  it  just  two  days   ago.  So  if  you  want  newsletter  go  below   in  the  description  you're  going  to  find   it  and  this  newsletter  is  very  short   like  it's  you  know  it's  like  five   sentences  and  people  love  it.  I  always   get  so  much  great  feedback.  People  say,   \"I  I  love  the  newsletter.  It's  to  the   point.  Never  spam.  Never  spam.\"  I  only   send  it  when  there  is  a  clear  signal.   And  on  uh  Sunday,  on  Sunday,  just  a  few   days  ago,  on  the  22nd,  we  did  send  this.   So,  let  me know  if  you  received  it.  But   yeah,  it's  very,  very  nice  newsletter.   It's  fantastic.  Fantastic.  So,  go  and   subscribe  using  the  link  below.  So,   guys,  Bitcoin  is  moving  towards  the  58K,   which  is  within  the  buy  zone.  It  is  a   200E  moving  average.  Why  did  I  say  58?   Why  not  57?  Why  not  56?  Why?  because   it's  the  200  week  moving  average.  Okay,   200WE  moving  average.  It  is  going  to  be   right  here  and  uh  it's  very  likely  that   we  get  some  kind  of  support.  I  mean  200   moving  average  after  all  is  the  biggest   most  important  support  for  Bitcoin  ever,   ever,  ever.  So  I  think  we're  going  to   use  it  as  support,  maybe  even  bounce   from  it  a  bit  because  that  would   correlate  with  what  we're  seeing.  If  you   go  to  the  charts  and  you  look  at  the  uh   performance,  let  me  actually  go  here  to   performance  and  you  look  at  the  midterm   year,  we  are  kind  of  due  for  a  bit  of  a   bounce.  Okay.  Now,  this  bounce,  it  never   comes  in  this  relief  rally,  you  know,   people  speak  about  relief  rally,  but  if   you  look  at  the  last  midterm  years   around  here,  you  see  a  lot  of  them,  both   the  uh  the  purple  one,  the  yellow  one,   and  the  orange  one,  they  have  a  bit  of  a   small  peak  here.  Very  very  small  peak.   Uh  so  maybe  it  means  that  we  go  to  200   week  and  we  rebound  a  bit.  Now  uh  as  you   know  we  don't  really  uh  follow  too  much   this  chart  alone.  We  follow  it  because   it  really  correlates  with  what  we're   seeing  in  the  price  chart.  Like  the   price  chart  is  showing  us  the  bare  trend   and  we're  going  lower.  And  then  just  for   fun  we're  also  using  this  midterm  year   comparison.  But  guys  it  been  exact.   People  saying  Ivan  you  cannot  compare.   It  will  never  be.  I  don't  know.  Yes.   This  far  has  been  exact.  So  I  think  it's   quite  an  interesting  chart  this  midterm   Europe  comparison  as  ever  since  the   beginning  people  were  saying  I  you   cannot  compare  why  you  compare  why  you   compare  it's  not  going  to  be  the  same   it's  not  going  to  be  the  same  but  um  it   is  man  it's  the  same  it's  the  same  so  if   we  get  a  a  pump  here  within  the  coming   10  days  don't  get  surprised  don't  get   surprised  it  will  actually  be  perfectly   in  line  and  as  you  know  the  midterm  year   normally  ends  quite  bad  -  58  -  64  -  72%   previous  midterm  years  that's  why  we   expect  the  the  you  know  the  flash  to   continue  a  bit  and  it's  perfect  guys.  I   mean  you  accumulate  here  cheap.  It's   probably  the  last  I  mean  for  real  now  is   the  last  time  for  real  guys  now  now  is   the  last  time  a  average  plebe  can  buy  a   full  Bitcoin.  We're  going  back  into  42   40s  like  you  know  50s  is  the  last  time   ever  in  Bitcoin  history  that  the  average   plebe  can  get  42.  Why  am  I  saying  that?   Because  the  average  player  can  get  the   Rolex  watch.  Average  pleber  can  I  mean   it's  you  know  it's  a  thing  that  it's   possible.  It's  possible.  So  if  you  feel   man  I  need  to  get  in  I  need  to  buy  a   full  bitcoin  you  will  have  your   opportunity  then  it's  going  to  be  only   institutional  and  average  play  but  we  we   need  to  deal  with  no  0.00001  0.005   0000  we  need  to  be  in  the  in  the  Satoshi   in  the  Satoshi  world.  Now  for  the  last   time  it  is  possible  to  get  a  full  one   very  very  soon  here  in  the  in  the  buy   zone.  So  don't  get  too  sad  guys.  Don't   get  too  sad.  It's  actually  good.  The   lower  lower  price  is  good.  It  means  that   everyone  can  get  cheap  and  you  know   Bitcoin  is  not  going  to  go  anywhere.  It   will  recover  for  sure.  It  will  recover   sooner  or  later.  I  think  it's  going  to   be  towards  the  end  of  the  year  that   we're  going  to  start  bottoming  out  but   for  sure  it  will  it's  not  it's  not  going   anywhere.  So  it's  just  think  of  it  just   that  you  can  get  it  cheaper.  You  can  get   it  cheaper  and  it's  going  to  be   fantastic  fantastic.  So  yeah,  that's   that  with  the  uh  with  the  Bitcoin  chart.   Um  XRP,  we  discussed  it  yesterday.   Solana  is  going  to  30.  Uh  people  say   it's  crazy.  I've  been  saying  it  for  I   mean  ever  since  here  somewhere  at  100   bucks  we  started  to  say  it  because   Bitcoin  started  sorry  Solana  started  to   go  into  the  support  zone  here  at  100   bucks  we  said  hey  wouldn't  be  crazy  if   it  went  to  30  because  there  is  no   support  here  and  as  you  can  see  it's   kind  of  bleeding  towards  that  target   very  very  nicely  uh  ETH  guys  ETH  I'm  not   really  I  mean  ETH  has  a  boring  chart   it's  just  sideways  chop  there  is  no  like   big  fall  or  no  big  pump  that  it  will  do   it's  just  boring  chop  but  it  may  get   excited  if  we  go  a  bit  below  a,000   because  then  we  can  speculate  whether  it   can  go  to  350  which  is  the  yellow  chart,   yellow  line  here.  We  discussed  it   yesterday  also  but  just  as  a  reminder   what  we  what  we  spoke  about  the   different  uh  different  targets  and  then   um  Kaggi  here  in  the  in  the  chat.  Kaggi   you  here  kaggi  was  saying  that  um  well   we  we  just  before  the  stream  we  were   chatting  that  you  look  at  many  coins   like  gaming  coins  a  lot  of  them  are   actually  in  price  discovery.  So,  let  me   show  you  a  few  of  them  and  how  to  play   it.  Because  you  see,  many  coins  like   Ronin  is  in  freaking  price  discovery,   but  to  the  downside.  The  uh  correct  time   to  short  it  and  be  bearish  was  of  course   here  when  the  bare  flip  happened.  But   it's  still  possible  to  short  them.  Uh   and  let  me  show  show  you  how  it's  done.   So  normally  when  they  do  this  price   discovery  to  the  downside  when  it  is  you   know  alltime  low  after  alltime  low  they   will  sometimes  consolidate  a  bit  like   for  example  Ronin  is  doing  now  which   means  that  as  soon  as  it  loses  this   level  you  can  try  shorting  you  can  try   shorting  because  literally  there's  no   there's  no  support  there's  nothing  below   there's  nothing  below  kind  of  another   example  was  here  that  you  know  it   consolid   how  how  big  drop  this  wasn't  a  big  drop   but  oh  okay  sorry  guys  it's  actually   I  I  guys  it  dropped  so  much  that  this  25   you  know  we  have  astronomical  drops  in   in  in  all  coins  like  they're  so   astronomical  the  all  coins  they  drop  in   such  astronomical  distance  that  you  know   this  small  distance  is  25%  with  leverage   it  can  easily  be  hundreds  of  percent.   So  next  time  this  thing  breaks  breaks   down  you  can  use  the  mechanical  rules   you  can  short  the  crap  out  of  it.   Absolutely.  And  which  exchanges  to  use?   Go  to  bulmania.com/partners   or  in  the  description  you're  going  to   see  exchanges  I  use.  You  can  short  the   crap  out  of  them  on  bybit  you  get  a  nice   big  signup  bonus  if  you  use  the  link   below  and  you  quickly  quickly  deposit.   That's  very  important.  Or  if  you  go  to   weeks  this  no  KYC  basically  low  low  KYC   bionics  for  bots  bit  uniques  like  all  of   them  have  shorting  you  can  long  you  can   short  in  the  bull  market.  We're  going  to   long  like  there's  no  tomorrow.  Now  we're   shorting  like  there's  no  tomorrow.  So  uh   you  have  a  few  of  these  charts  that  are   at  alltime  low  and  they  they  go  to  like   new  alltime  low.  You  can  check  the   yourself  in  your  watch  list  which  ones   are  like  that.  But  Ronin  is  one.  Then   let's  see  how  is  OP.  A  lot  of  this  L2   for  Gazi  coins  they're  kind  of  the  same   guys.  They  also  have  alltime  low.  Yeah.   So  for  example  OP  OP  clear  example  right   here  where  it  did  go  sideways  a  bit  then   it  broke  down  and  uh  once  it  broke   breaks  down  after  a  bit  of  sideways  as   you  can  see  oh  my  god  it's  35%  here.  You   get  35%  easy,  easy,  easy  here  after  a   breakdown.  So,  consolidation  and   breakdown.  Of  course,  you  need  to  know   the  mechanical  rules,  you  know  how  to   use  so  you  know  how  to  do  the  stop-   loss,  how  to  do  all  of  that.  To  learn   them,  go  to  bullmania.com.   Go  to  bullmania.com.  Watch  the  free   training.  So,  you  know  how  to  set set   stop-  loss,  how  to  deploy  mechanical   rules  because  you  may  have  a  counter   trend  rally  at  any  time.  So,  you  need  to   have  a  position  size  and  stop  loss  so   you're  stopped  out  in  case  it  goes   against  you.  Uh,  and  then  let's  see   which  other  one  is  at  alltime  low.  You   can  guys  you  can  you  guys  can  write  in   the  comment  section  here  but  I  think   arbitum  is  another  one  because  it's  L2   Fugazi  and  yes  indeed  it's  the  same  it's   the  same  man  it's  the  same  a  bit  of   sideways  here  you  see  it  went  a  bit  of   sideways  for  two  weeks  and  now  we're   using  the  weekly  chart  weekly  is  the   best  for  this  big  moves  a  a  bit  of   sideways  for  two  weeks  then  boop   fantastic  fantastic  also  like  uh  20%  20%   with  leverage  of  obviously  it's  more  and   if  we  look  at  our  community  during  the   last  24  hours  uh  the  bears  are  in   control  so  you  have  and  eight  starting   to  starting  to  short  crazy  leverage  but   if  you  have  mechanical  rule  you  have   stop-loss  you  can  do  it  but  you  have  to   be  careful  you  can  you  always  need   mechanical  rules  welcome  to  the  dark   side  says  passive  then  you  have  this  guy   TT  crypto  shorting  for  the  first  time   saying  shout  out  to  Ivan  and  Jason  never   been  able  to  to  shorts  comfortable  until   I  joined  Bulmania  95%  in  my  fcoin  80%   short  at  40%  short  you  have  supreme   governor  supreme  governor  is  back   shorting  the  crap  out  of  Bitcoin.   Fantastic.  Banksy  rules  shorting  Sana.   Yo  yo  Kagi,  I  included  you  today  also.   Kagi  Kagi  Kagi  the  you  know  the  gaming   YouTuber  in  our  comment  section  here.   Kagi  make  some  noise  but  fantastic   fantastic  first  trades  as  well.  And   Kagi,  you  still  need  to  do  the  course.   You  said  that  you  didn't  do  the   mechanical  rules  course.  So  now  you're   you're  still  just  vibe  trading.  Uh  you   are  one  mistake  away  from  getting   ruined.  So  you  need  the  mechanical   rules,  man.   is  congrats  on  the  profits  and  yeah  hype   short  bitcoin  short  uh  sana  short  so   it's  still  shorting  guys  shorting  is   where  the  gains  are  and  this  is  the   thing  many  people  say  Ivan  why  focus  on   short  because  we  we're  here  speaking   about  what  what  makes  money  like  we  want   we  want  to  make  money  even  in  this   market  I  don't  want  to  waste  a  year   being  depressed  guys  I've  been  there   like  I've  been  there  before  you  know   that  bare  market  starts  and  then  it's  a   year  of  just  being  depressed  why  why  be   that  instead  you  have  the  other  side  of   the  market  there  are  two  buttons  there's   long  button  and  there  is  short  button  if   there  for  a  reason.  Is  there  is  there   for  a  reason?  You  know,  let's  imagine   you  do  your  diet  and  you  discover  what   the  hell  there  is  fish  and  you  never   test  tried  fish  before.  Like,  man,  there   is  meat  and  there's  fish.  Why  say  no?   Now,  some  people  don't  like  fish.  Some   people  don't  eat  anything  that  is   swimming.  That's  okay.  That's  okay.  But   you  get  the  point.  Look  here.  We're  now   in  extreme  fear.  The  fear  and  greed   index  is  the  lowest  it's  ever  been.  And   some  people  are  saying  that  we  have  to   bounce.  But  guys,  as  you  know,  fear  and   greed  is  one  of  the  lowest  signal  um   signal  indicators.  I  I  I  mean  if  if   you're  watching  the  channel,  you  know   it,  but  let  me  just  repeat  it  that  when   it's  fearful,  it  can  be  way  more  fearful   and  the  prices  can  drop  another  70%.  And   it's  still  fearful.  Okay,  you  have  it  in   this  cycle.  Uh  let  me  just  zoom  in  here   so  it's  very  very  clear  here.  The  price   was  like,  you  know,  90,  it  was  extreme   fear  and  now  the  price  is  like  soon  50.   It's  now  62ish.  And  it's  also  extreme   fear.  Okay.  So  I  mean  what's  the  point   of  it?  It  can  be  extreme  fear  at  100K  or   at  50K.  Still  extreme  fear.  Well,  it's   kind  of  like  what  uh  Cheds  said  here   that  Bitcoin  is  approaching  the  lowest   RSI  in  history,  which  is  the  the   momentum  of  the  of  the  price.  But  the   thing  is  oversold  RSI  uh  mistakenly  is   sometimes  used  by  traders  as  a  a  way  to   start  longing.  They  start  they  become   bullish  when  RSI  is  low.  In  reality,  the   way  you  want  to  use  it  is  that  if  you   have  a  bare  trend,  let's  say  Bitcoin  is   in  bare  trend  or  any  asset  is  in  bare   trend  and  the  RSI  is  low,  it's  just   confirmation  that  the  trend  is  bearish   because  low  RSI  can  stay  low  for  a  very   long  time.  I  mean  very  very  long.  You   have  months  and  months  and  months  of  low   RSI.  Okay,  at  some  point  of  course  it's   going  to  bottom  out.  But  this  is  you   cannot  trade  based  on  RSI  along.  It's   impossible.  You're  going  to  get  so  so   wrecked.  In  reality,  the  better  way  to   use  it  is  that  you  have  a  bare  trend  uh   in  the  price  chart  and  then  you  can   check  RSI  just  to  get  like  a  secondary   confirmation.  Okay,  RSI  is  also  is  also   going  down.  And  don't  use  this  oversold   because  there's  no  such  thing  as   oversold  because  oversold  can  be  even   more  oversold.  Like  there  there's  no   such  thing,  you  know,  oh,  now  it's   dumped  so  much.  There's  no  such  thing.   Yeah.  The  only  the  only  such  thing  is   when  the  trend  shift  to  the  upside  you   can  never  predict  a  falling  knife  where   it's  going to  stop  falling.  You  can  keep   falling  for  another  two  months  and  in   two  months  your  [ __ ]  goes  down  90%.   And  never  try  to  predict  when  a  resid   bottom  out.  If  it's  oversold  or   overbought  for  that  matter  because   something  that's  overbought  can  be   overbought  for  another  6  months  easy.   And  what  happens  to  your  portfolio?  You   exit  because  it's  overbought.  It  does   another  10x.  So  never  never  see  it  as  a   way  to  predict  anything.  Instead,  it  is   a  way  where  you  have  a  price  trend  and   you  see  the  RSI  being  the  same.  Okay,  if   it's  price  is  bearish,  it's  oversold.   Good.  It's  actually  a  good  confirmation   that  you're  short  is  okay.  It's  you're   correct.  You're  correct.  And  then  should   this  flip?  Fantastic.  Stop.  If  you  just   enter  a  position,  your  stop  loss  will   work.  If  you  entered  the  a  while  ago  and   you're  in  a  profit,  you  have  a  trailing   stop  loss.  Okay?  If  it  shifts,   fantastic.  So,  all  in  all,  that's  how   you  use  RSI.  You  don't  use  it  to  to,  you   know,  become  bullish  because  it's   oversold.  It  doesn't  work  like  that.   Now,  look  here.  Nakamoto.  This  is  why  I   don't  like  guys.  I  don't  like  treasury   companies.  I  am  not  a  fan.  I  absolutely   not  a  fan  of  treasury  companies  because   Nakamoto  treasury  company  down  99%.   There's  a  lot  of  drama  with  this  David   Bailey  because  he  bought  his  own  company   with  this  Nakamoto  funds  which  is  a   public  listed  company  but  he  somehow  did   you  know  selfdeing.  I  don't  know  exactly   the  details  you  can  read  more  but  I  do   know  that  it's  down  a  lot  and  99%  and   you  may  be  thinking  how  is  it  possible   that  a  bitcoin  treasury  company  how  can   you  lose  99%.  You  should  have  Bitcoin  at   the  uh  at  the  core  of  your  company  which   should  be  like  the  floor.  But  as  you  can   see,  management  can  really  mess  it  up   bigly.  And  that's  why  we  stay  away  from   treasury  companies  including  micro   strategy.  Including  micro  strategy.   There's  really  no  reason  for  us  to  be   there.  If  you  want  more  gains,  you  want   more  volatility,  you  want  to  uh  have   bigger  swings,  okay,  go  to  buy  bit,  use   the  link  below,  get  signup  bonus.  You  at   least  then  you're  in  control.  So  there   are  other  ways  to  get  more  volatility.   You  want  more  gains  than  you  know  normal   huddle.  Okay,  you  can  use  leverage.  But   at least  then  you're  in  control.  It's   not  some  dude  somewhere  doing  some  board   meeting  and  deciding  on  your  behalf.  You   decide.  You  decide.  Now  Vitalik  decided   something  and  unfortunately  he  decided   to  sell  more.   Man,  he's  selling.  He's  selling.  He's   over  the  past  three  days.  He  sold  3.7K   ETH.  Selling,  selling,  and  selling.   Someone  asked  Ivan,  but  um  how  can   Vitalik  really  affect  price  when  he's   selling  just  a  few  million?  Well,  it's   it's  a  confidence  signal.  It's  a   confidence  signal.  Of  course,  him   selling  a  few  million  here  and  there   will  not  move  the  price  alone,  but  it's   like  Elon  selling  Tesla,  you  know.  It's   like  Zuckerberg  selling  Facebook.  It's   like  Coinbase  founder  Brian  Armstrong   selling  a  Coinbase  stock.  He's  also   selling.  It's  not  a  good  look.  Like,   he's  not,  you  know,  he's  selling.  And  so   what  I'm  going  to  buy  I'm  going  to  buy   his  bag.  You  know,  I'm  a  CUK  to  his  he   just  sold  and  what  I'm  I'm  buying  it.   Like  what  is  this?   You  know,  it's  a  bit  of  psychological   problem.  Maybe  Vitalik  needs  to  go  to   Dagistan  two  three  years.  I  think  for   his  body  mass  like  his  body  composition   will  be  very  very  nice  actually  two   three  years.   Okay.  So  RSI  is  uh  is  oversold.  It  can   stay  oversold  for  quite  some  time  and   yeah  this  is  not  a  a  reason  to  trade  in   a  bullish  direction  because  it's   oversold.  Uh  in  reality  it's  just  a   confirmation  of  of  the  current  trend.   Next.  Oh  guys,  guys,  this  Bernie   Sanders,  I  gonna  play  it  to  you  later.   But  just  like  Mer  says,  encrypt  your   money  from  communist  grandpas.  Communist   grandpas  are  coming  for  us  bigly,  bigly,   bigly,  bigly.  We're  going  to  be  speaking   about  that  soon.  Guys,  let's  speak  speak   about  the  Bitcoin  heat  m  because  this  is   something  that  Kagi  asked  me  before  the   stream  also.  For  example,  when  you  have   different  liquidations  liquidation   levels,  how  likely  is  it  that  we're   going  to  go  and  hit  them  and  grab   liquidity  basically?  And  um  the  the   common  uh  view  of  this  is  that  the   market  maker  will  chase  the  longs.  The   market  maker  will  chase  the  shorts  also.   And  um  uh  it  is  true.  I  mean  it's  true   that  yes  sometimes  if  you  want  liquid  to   grab  liquidity  let's  say  you're  a  market   maker  and  you  have a  bunch  of  buy  orders   like  you  maybe  you  have  institutional   clients  you  have  people  that  want  to   buy.  Okay.  If  they  just  buy  now  they're   going  to  push  the  price  too  much.  So  you   need  to  create  a  bit  of  fear,  a  bit  of   panic.  So  many  people  start  selling  and   then  you  have  liquidity  created  and  then   you  can  enter  your  buy  put  in  your  buy   orders  and  they're  going  to  be  matched.   So  uh  it's  true  but  and  normally  yes   normally  we  do  grab  liquidity  you  know   we  we  liquidate  when  it's  too  much   concentration  of  longs  or  shorts  but   it's  not  something  you  can  trade  on   either.  I  see  many  people  trying  to   trade  based  on  this  you  know  liquidity   or  they  get  super  excited  when  there  is   liquidity  to  liquidate  below  or  above.   This  is  this  is  not  a  tradeable  chart   guys.  Why?  Because  uh  if  you  are  in   bulmania,  you  know  the  mechanical  rules.   You  understand  that  it's  all  about  uh   having  an  entry  plan.  When  do  you  enter?   Like  when  do  you  have  a  repeatable  how   do  you  use  this  to  have  a  repeatable   strategy?  How  to  enter  your  position?   How  to  exit  your  position?  How  to  take   profit?  How  to  put  stop  loss?  Like  how   do  you  do  it  on  this  chart?  I  I   literally  have  no  clue  how  you  would  do   it  with  the  trend  shifts  with  mechanical   rules.  With  u  uh  the  trend  shift,  you   can  easily  do  it.  You  can  easily  do  it.   you  have  a  bull  to  bear,  you  can  easily   set  stop  loss  based  on  the  condition  of   the  trend.  Here  you  can  easily  do  it.  Uh   with  this,  there  is  no  way  to  do  it.  So   this  is  more  like  a  secondary  or  maybe   like  tertiary  signal  where  I  mean  if  if   if  the  trend  is  bare  and  there's   liquidity  to  grab  it  gives  you  a  bit   more  confidence  that  yeah,  probably   we're  gonna  grab  it.  Okay,  probably   we're  gonna  grab  it.  We're  gonna  grab  it   just  like  Trump  likes  grabbing   something.  The  same  thing  is  with  market   maker.  He's  going  to  grab  it.  Okay.  So,   yeah,  that's  that  that's  how  I  use  it.  I   haven't  seen  anyone  else  like  cons   consistently  over  and  over  again  be  able   to  use  this  liquidity  in  some  other  way.   Okay.  So,  that's  that  guys.  We  have  some   insider  trading  going  on  with  Jane   Street.  Basically,  the  Terraform  Labs,   this  bankrupt  company  that  Doan  was   running,  they  are  now  in  bankruptcy.   They  are  now  suing  Jane  Street.  Why?   because  they  are  accusing  them  of  the   2022  crypto  winter  and  that  they  uh   destroyed  Terraform  basically  the  Terral   Luna  uh  and  uh  they  did  it  by  first   deping  the  token  and  destroying  the   ecosystem  then  pretending  to  rescue   pretending  to  rescue  and  here  they  have   some  onchain  evidence  that  they  sold  a   bunch  of  these  stable  coins  to  DPEG  and   to  destabilize  and  then  pretend  to  save   it  this  and  that.  Uh  yeah,  is  it   correct?  Is  it  not  correct?  Who  the  hell   knows?  But  u  Jane  Street  is  replying   that  it's  just  a  a  blatant,  desperate   and  baseless  attempt  to  extract  money.   Uh  can  it  be  like  that?  It  could  be  like   that.  It  could  be  like  that.  I  mean  if   you  are  a  bankruptcy   lawyer  like  bankruptcy  administrator  of   Terraform  Labs,  it  is  kind  of  in  your   responsibility  to  sue  everyone.  I  mean   it  kind  of  is  like  that  because  if  you   are  a  bankruptcy  a  bankruptcy  lawyer   your  job  is  to  h  get  as  much  money  as   possible  for  the  creditors  for  whoever   you  know  has  debt  the  company  has  debt   to.  So  let's  say  you're  a  bankruptcy   employer  it's  kind  of  your   responsibility  to  be  reasonable  or  maybe   unreasonable  sometimes  also  to  get  as   much  money  back  as  possible.  So  let's   see  it's  just  a  lawsuit.  Um  and  uh  yeah   uh  it's  going  to  take  years  for  this  to   figure  out.  But  one  thing  is  certain   that  when  you  have  this  big  players  in   crypto,  a  lot  of  them  of  course  have   information  that  you  don't  have.  A  lot   of  them  have  uh  do  do  things  that  they   say  uh  that  they  don't  say  or  they  say   something  and  then  they  do  otherwise.  So   what  is  the  conclusion?  Don't  read  what   people  are  saying,  what  they're   tweeting,  what  they're  posting.  Read   what  they're  doing.  And  that  is  seen  in   the  price  chart.  It's  clearly  clearly   seen  in  the  price  chart.  When  price  is   going  down,  someone  is  dumping.  Someone   is  dumping.  Can  be  insiders.  It  can  be   the  team.  It  can  be  it  can  be  anyone.   But  someone  is  dumping.  Okay?  And  if  the   trend  then  turns  bearish,  you  know  that   okay,  big  players,  they're  not  buying  it   up.  Team  is  not  buying  it  up.  Uh  it's   dumping.  So  that  that  that's  your  signal   to  act.  Your  signal  is  not  to  act  when   news  comes  out.  You  know,  these  guys   they  say  they're  going  to  support.  So   that's  the  biggest  lesson  here.  We  don't   know,  of  course,  what  the  big  players   are  doing.  We  don't  know  whether  it's   correct  or  not  correct  this  lawsuit.  Who   the  hell  knows?  But  it  wouldn't  at  all   surprise  me  if  some  of  it  was  correct.   Would  and  it  happens  every  day  that  the   markets  move  and  then  people  are   confused  why  why  but  you  said  this  but   you  know  this  guy  was  so  bullish  and   then  we  go  down  90%.  Happens  all  the   time.  It  happens  all  the  time.  Now  guys   what  is  interesting  now  is  that  Zack  XBT   he  has  been  teasing  a  bit  that  he  will   do  a  investigation  uh  on  insider   trading.  And  so  then  after  Zach  XBT  had   this  announcement  that  of  the   investigation,  then  this  Jane  Street   news  came  out.  But  Zack  XBC  still  hasn't   published  his  investigation.  He  said   that  the  major  investigation  is  going  to   drop  on  February  26  on  one  of  crypto's   most  profitable  businesses  where   multiple  employees  abuse  internal  data   to  insider  trade  over  a  prolonged  period   of  time.  Now,  is  it  this  Jane  Street   thing?  I'm  not  sure  because  this  Jane   Street  it  was  just  short  period  of  time   and  also  most  crypto  businesses  can  can   sigh  of  relief.  Do  you  say  that  you  know   you  you  is  that  do  you  say  you  sigh  of   relief?  They  can  take  like  a  a  breath  of   relief.  Why?  because  he  said  that  it's   only  profitable  business  that  he  that   he's  investigating   and  most  crypto  businesses  can  sigh  of   relief  that  they  are  not  investigated.   As  you  know,  most  crypto  businesses  are   not  profitable.   Exactly.  So  yeah,  and  I  even  think,   wait,  wait,  I  even  think  Starknet   Stark  and  guys,  yeah,  it  can  it   definitely  not  us.  At least  this  L2   Fazi,   you  know,  starting  is  big  for  guys.  I   mean,  in  terms  of  Yeah.  the  the  the   amount  of  hype  they  had  versus  how  much   actually  was  delivered  is  crazy.  Didn't   they  actually  Yeah.  Yeah.  You  hear  Stark   that  one  of  crypto's  most  profitable   businesses  can't  be  us.  Exactly.   I  love  it.  I  love  it.  You  got  to  have   humor.  I  got  to  give  Stark  that.  It's   fantastic.  It  can't  be  us.  Exactly.  So   guys,  you  can  probably  take  a  sigh  of   relief  also.  It's  uh  probably  not  uh  not   you.  If  your  wreck  is  not  you,  you're   not  investigated.  But  on  Poly  Market,   there  are  now  bets  on  who  he  will   expose.  Let  me  see  where  where  is  this   Poly  Market.  So  we  have  Meteora.  Uh   okay,  Meteora.  That's  interesting.  Then   you  have  Axiom  which  is  ah  yeah  I  mean   it  can  easily  be  one  of  this  uh  meme   trading  meme  trading  platforms.  It  can   easily  be  that  that  you  know  they  launch   some  coin  themselves  then  they  pump  it   on  their  own  platform  and  uh  dump  it   could  be  like  that  Mexi  Jupiter  but  yeah   Meteora  is  interesting.  Yeah.  So  you  can   you  can  uh  follow  a  bit  you  know  which   company  is  going  to  be  exposed  but  I   don't  think  it's  Jane  Street  guys   because  he  said  over  a  long  period  of   time  and  this  Jane  Street  I  guess  was   just  uh  during  the  terra  collapse  and   yeah  so  that's  that  uh  guys  moving  on  uh   here  is  why  Zcash  but  also  Bitcoin  is   not  going  to  go  anywhere.  We  have  the   promoter  here  Mr.  Sanders.  He  just  got   hired  into  the  marketing  team  for  crypto   and  he's  already  making  rounds  on  the   television  uh  basically  explaining  the   use  case  of  crypto  very  very  nicely.   Listen  to  this.  So  the  issue  comes  down   to  whether  or  not  we  ask  the  wealthiest   people  in  this  country,  many  of  them   living  right  here  in  California,  to   start  paying  their  fair  share  of  taxes   so  that  3  million  people  in  this  state   can  get  healthcare.  Yeah.   >> And  I  think  the  answer  is  pretty   obvious.  Yes.  That's  what  we  got  to  do.   >> Oh,  we've  already  seen  uh  Larry  Paige,   Peter  Teal,  David  Saxs,  Larry  Ellison   start  to  move  out  of  Isn't  that   something?   >> But  the  but  the  ar  the  argument   >> No,  here's  what  the  argument  is.  The   argument  is  it  is  outrageous.  What  they   are  saying  to  the  people  of  California   is  it  doesn't  matter  to  us.  We're   billionaires  and  we're  getting  richer   and  richer  and  if  children  die  because   they  can't  get  to  a  doctor,  tough  luck.   We  have  the  power.  California.  Yes.  And   we  are  going  to  punish  you.  No,  they  lie   a  lot.  These  guys  when  Mandani  was   running  for  mayor  in  New  York  City,  you   may  recall  everybody  all  the  rich  guys   were  going  to  leave.  It  didn't  happen.   Now  whether  they  do  or  not,  I  don't   know.  Who  knows?  But  the  idea  that  they   are  saying  that  it's  okay  for  children   to  die,  people  not  get  the  health  care   they  need,  and  they're  going  to  punish   the  people  of  California.  That  is   outrageous.  And  by  the  way,  that  is  why   I  will  be  introducing  a  national  wealth   tax.  where  they  going  to  run  that.  Maybe   they'll  run  to  Saudi  Arabia.  I  suspect   that's  where  they'll  go.   >> But,  you  know,  you  got  to  at  some  point   you  got  to  stand  up  to  these  guys.   >> But  that's  the  Newsome  argument  that  we   should  do  it  nationally,  but  if  we  do  it   just  here,   >> somebody's  got  to  hurt  California's   revenue.   >> I'm  going  to  introduce  the  legislation   ain't  going  to  pass  right  away.   >> And  if  California  can  do  it,  this  will   be  a  message,  by  the  way,  not  only  to   America,  it'll  be  a  message  to  the   world.   >> Guys,  let's  unpack  it.  Holy  crap.  Let's   unpack  it.  First  and  foremost,  I  I  want   to  say  that  this  is  I  mean,  you  see  how   he  speaks.  If  you  have  any  money,  you   will  be  compared  to  someone  who  lets   children  die.  I  mean,  that's  what  he's   saying.  So,  that's  why  if  in  any   country,  guys,  if  you  have  any  kind  of   financial  success  and  you  see  the   society  sliding  this  way,  this  is  how   you're  going  to  be  compared.  This  is  how   you're  going  to  be  painted  on  the   television.  Okay.  Now,  some  people  are   saying,  but  I  is  only  for  billionaires,   guys.  It's  not  like  it's  look  at   Netherlands.  36%  unrealist  gains  tax   that  is  likely  going  to  pass.  Guzman,   please  confirm  what's  happening  there.   It's  going  to  be  for  everyone.  It's   going  to  be  for  everyone.  The  same   thing,  I  mean,  looking  at  history,   Russian  Revolution,  if  you  had  one  cow   and  one  goat  already,  you're  a  freaking   Kulak.  You  will  be  taken  care  of  by  the   state,  meaning  that  everything  is  going   to  be  confiscated.  And  if  you're  lucky,   you're  going  to  not  be  touched   physically  and  you're  going  to  survive.   If  you're  lucky,  we're  going  to  we  need   to  check  by  our  committee  will  first   check  if  if  it's  okay.  But  then  also   looking  at  uh  Europe,  you  know  that  you   enter  a  highest  tax  bracket  in  Europe  if   you  have  like  $4  in  salary.  Okay,   did  you  know  that  like  for  many   Americans  it's  maybe  a  bit  of  a  shock   but  in  Europe  you  you you  easily  enter   the  highest  tax.  You  have  like  four   fivek  per  month  like  dollars  dollars  and   you're  already  like  know  the  top  top  the   ultimate  rich.  Okay.  So,  and  and  this  is   why  like  the  US  still  is  a  bit  different   because  as  far  as  I  know  to  be  in  the   highest  bracket  there  I  mean  you  need  to   be  substantially  more  maybe  hundreds  of   thousands  in  in  Europe  in  many  countries   okay  four  5k  per  month  which  is  you  know   good  luck  paying  rent  if  if  you  live  in   a  big  city  it's  yeah  a  lot  is  going  to   go  to  rent  and  so  the  conclusion  here   guys  is  you  really  I  mean  you  need  to   take  this  seriously  what  he's  saying   here  you  need  to  take  it  seriously  you   are  in  the  US  you  are  in  any  other   country  where  the  society  if  if  You   think  that  this  is  going  to  work  on  the   average  Karen  in  your  neighborhood  that   she  watches  this  and  she's  like,  \"Hell   yeah,  go  Bernie.  Go  Bernie.\"  Okay,  you   got  to  be  careful.  You  need  society   where  if  they  hear  something  like  this,   they  don't  take  it  seriously  or  they   think  it's  a  corrupt  politician  speaking   about  some  mambo  jumbo.  Okay,  very   important.  It's  it's it's  crucial.  It's   actually  crucial.  I  mean  ideally  you   don't  have  politicians  speaking  like   this  at  all  but  otherwise  if  you  have   the  average  Karen  being  excited  about   this  and  you  know  out  for  a  blind   it's  going  to  come  it's  going  to  come   bigly  bigly  bigly  bigly  and  as  you  can   see  they  will  try  to  push  this  on  a   national  level  in  the  US  sadly  guys  I   got  to  tell  you  I  I  think  they  will   succeed  why  because  Trump  has  taken  his   uh  craziness  too  far  and  he's  going  to   have  a  backlash  he's  going  to  have  a  big   backlash  uh  mass  massive  backlash  with  a   tariff  like  everything  like  it's  too   chaotic  man  it's  too  chaotic  so  um   whatever  goes  wrong  whatever  you  know   maybe  some  whatever  problem  the  country   has  whether  Trump  created  it  or  not  it's   going to  be  so  easy  to  blame  on  Trump   like  so  easy  to  blame  on  Trump  so  that's   why  I  think  you  know  the  pendulum  is   going  to  swing  back  even  if  Trump  didn't   cause  any  issue  every  single  issue  is   going  to  blamed  on  him  on  the  craziness   on  the  ter  you  know  and  everything  else   and  the  famous  files  and  like  it  is   becoming  quite  uh  heavy  there.  So  the   pendulum  is  going  to  swing  back  right  to   the  Bernie.  Okay,   you  heard  it  here  first.  I  think  as  the   Bernies  and  the  Kamalas  and  the  AOC's   they  going  to  take  the  next  uh  they're   going  to  be  in  charge  next.  Uh  that  that   would  be  my  bet.  And  also  what's  the   let's  say  I'm  wrong.  What's  the  downside   of  protecting  yourself  anyway?  Okay,   let's  say  that  Trump  well  he  cannot  uh   technically  he  cannot  run  again  but   let's  say  Republicans  win  again.  Um,   okay,  great.  You  you're  protected.  Uh,   nothing  lost.  But  see,  it's  better  to  be   like  nomad  capitalist  guy  is  saying,   it's  better  to  be  a  few  years  too  early   with  your  capital  protection,  with  your   international  structuring  than  one  day   too  late  because  if  you're  one  day  too   late  and  there  is  exit  tax,  massive   exit.  Well,  the  US  has  already,  but  it's   still  manageable.  Uh,  and  there  is  a   Berlin  wall  around  your  country,   financial  burner  war,  then  it's  totally   different.  But  I  think  you  get  the   point.  Uh,  guys,  next  next.  Fed  Fed  Fed   Fed   uh  is  removing  uh  crypto  uh  reputational   risk  uh  from  bank  supervision.   Basically,  you  know,  previously  with   Camala  uh  the  Fed  put  a  warning  sign  on   all  banks  that  did  with  uh  crypto.  Okay.   Now  it  seems  that  they  are  uh  moving   away  from  that.  So  that's  uh  that's   quite  good.  Um  and  then  there's  yeah   speaking  about  the  terminal  there's  a   lot  of  debate  back  and  forth  what's   going  to  happen  now.  Congress  must  enact   Trump's  tariffs  now  to  sear  to  steer  the   US  from  a  massive  revenue  cliff  because   otherwise  they  will  have  to  refund  all   of  the  tariffs.  It's  a  lot.  It's  like   150  billion  is  the  number  I  saw.  Uh   another  uh  debate  tariff  ruling  sparks   refund  chaos  that  small  businesses  and   families  can't  afford.  Yeah.  How  does  it   work  in  the  US  guys?  You  you you  pay   tariff  now  or  what  happens?  I  mean  I   guess  you  pay  tariff  now.  You  buy   electronic  from  other  countries  or   anything  any  good  you  need  to  pay  tariff   I  guess.  Uh,  I  mean,  you  always  pay  the   I  mean,  I  know  it  myself.  It's  the  same   thing.  I  I  do  the  same  thing.  I  mean,   you  order  something  from  outside  your   economical  area,  so  to  speak,  you  pay   higher.  I  mean,  so so  it's  always  the   consumer  that  pays.  Um,  now  look  here.   Uh,  Binance  is  under  pressure  again.  Uh,   people  and  authorities  are  um  accusing   them  of  facilitating  money  to  Iran.  Uh,   basically  1.7  billion  dollars  worth  of   crypto.  They're  being  accused  of  that.   They  facilitated.  He's  saying  no  no  no   we  did  not  facilitate  CZ  says  and  by  the   way  CZ  is  still  involved  with  Binance.   People  are  saying  CZ  is  not  a  part  of   Binance.  He's  the  biggest  shareholder   and  the  Binance  CEO  confirmed  that   either  he's  the  biggest  or  one  of  the   biggest.  I  believe  he's  the  biggest   shareholder.  And  so  if  you  are  the   biggest  shareholder,  it  means  that   you're  part  of  the  uh  shareholder   meetings.  Each  company  has  at  least  one   annual  shareholder  meeting  per  uh  per   year.  You  of  course  influence  the  board   decisions.  The  board  answers  to  you.  van   of  the  day  if  the  board  does  something   that  you  don't  want  that  you're  against   about  that  you're  against  that  the  you   as  the  biggest  shareholder  and  you  know   as  that  that's  not  in  the  interest  of   you  you  can  hold  them  legally  liable  so   board  answers  to  shareholder  CZ  is  the   biggest  shareholder  or  one  of  the   biggest  and  then  you  have  CEO  the  answer   to  the  board  and  appointed  by  the  board   so  it  doesn't  matter  that  CZ  is  not  CEO   anymore  if  he's  the  shareholder  if  he's   the  biggest  shareholder  he  has  all  of   the  power.  So  keep  that  in  mind.  Um  next   backpack.  This  is  going  to  be   interesting.  Backpack  wants  to  IPO.  I   mean  this  one  is  quite  interesting   because  it  is  a  wallet  as  you  know  and   also  centralized  exchange  I  guess  also   in  the  same  uh  but  they  are  looking  to   IPO  and  I  haven't  seen  this  before.   Basically  they  will  give  equity  to  token   holders  and  that's  good  man.  I  like   that.  I  like  that.  Otherwise,  most   crypto  companies,  they  don't  give  their   uh  their  token  holders  anything   tangible.  I  mean,  you  have a  token,   this  token,  no  one  cares  about  it.  Uh,   you  know,  maybe  it  trades  uh  based  on   hype,  maybe  it  trades  based  on  some  news   article,  but  the  real  revenue  goes  to   the  company.  So,  good  that  there  is  some   some  real  uh  real  not  revenue  share,  but   equity  share  with  the  token  holders.   Now,  guys,  let's  check  a  bit  what's   happening  in  the  overall  bubbles.  You   have  worldacy  finance  up  25%.  I  guess   because  they  did  a  announcement  that   they're  going  to  be  tokenizing  a   property  in  the  uh  mold.  Oh,  sorry.  So,   now   it  updated.  Sorry,  guys.  It  was  a  slow   update.  Now  it  updated.  Uh,  it's  down,   man.  It's  down.  Let's  see.  It's  up  on   the  week  because  they  just  announced  a   new  project.  Yeah.  Anyway,  it's  down.   It's  down.  This  is  the  problem,  guys.   You  wake  up,  you  check  your  portfolio,   it's  green,  and  then  it  reloads.  Okay.   in  general.  Um,  you  remember  a  few   streams  ago  we  said  that  uh  it's  is   gravity.  Gravity  is  pulling  it  back.   It's  it's  a  red  mainly  everywhere  and   yeah  our  our  green  yeah  it's  red  every  I   don't  even  know  what  to  discuss  here.   It's  uh  is  bare  bare  trend  you  you   short.  Okay.  You  short  and  if  something   is  green  like  we  just  saw  you  know   before  a  few  seconds  ago  that's  actually   a  signal  that  is  going  to  be  pulled   down.  Uh  this  was  what  I  said  a  few   streams  ago  that  if  you  see  something   like  green  and  you're  like  wow  this   thing  is  up  a  lot  while  everything  is   down  it  is  actually  a  shorting   opportunity  once  it  starts  showing   weakness  and  it  starts  to  go  go  down   because  the  gravity  no  one  cancelled  the   gravity  the  gravity  is  still  here.  Um   let's  see  what  else  we  can  check  um   let's  check  this  one  we  check   performance  by  year  looking  at  um  where   we  are  now  in  the  Bitcoin  homing  cycle.   So  this  is  percent  performance  from  the   uh  from  the  h  havinging  we  still  have  a   bit  of  down  to  go  to  reach  a  bottom.  Uh   so  as  that  low  to  low  also  uh  from  the   previous  low  to  the  next  low  we  have  a   bit  of  down  to  go  if  we  repeat  and  you   know  people  but  it  will  not  repeat  how   you  for  your  cycle  how  how  you  can  how   you  can  you  know  they  are  foaming   they're  foaming  at  the  mouth.  How  how   it's  exact  man  it's  exact  it  peaked  out   here  and  then  it  went  down  and  yeah  it   did  the  peak  it  was  exact  it  was  exact   like  can  we  conclude  that  I  mean  to  be   fair  I  don't  hear  anyone  saying  that   it's  it's  it's   different  but  I  remember  in  January  in   at  the  end  of  December  there  were  many   people  still  saying  you're  wrong  you're   wrong  you're  okay  okay okay  I  mean  to   each  their  own  man  to  each  their  own   okay  you're  wrong  I  guess  you're  right   then  you're  right  you're  right  what  does   your  portfolio  say  minus  80%  okay  that's   I  guess  you're  right  what  you   I  mean,  how  do  what's  the  scoreboard?  I   mean,  I  guess  you're  right  then.  Okay.   Anyway,  guys,  let's  go  to  Q&A  questions,   answers,  debates,  discussions.  While  you   are  thinking  about  questions,  number   one,  go  to  bullme.com/partners   to  uh  sign  up  for  exchanges  that  I  use.   You  have  the  buy  bit,  you  have  big  fat   signup  bonus  if  you  deposit  pion,   pionex,  wigs,  bitunix,  and  so  on.  And  as   always,  go  to  bullmania.com   if  you  want  to  learn  the  mechanical   rules.  you're  able  to  take  the   opportunity  of  the  market.  You  don't   mess  up  the  next  cycle.  It's  very   important.  You  got  to  prepare  already.   Now,  if  you  feel  that  this  cycle  didn't   really  go  how  you  planned  well  because   you  didn't  have  the  correct  knowledge,   you  didn't  have  the  correct  you  maybe   followed  the  wrong  people,  people  that   told  you  to  buy  the  deep  or  business   cycle  or  what  the  hell  they  told  you.  Uh   understand  the  system  for  real,  how  the   market  works  for  real.  Go  to   bulmania.com,  watch  the  free  training,   and  then  join  Bulmania.  You're  going  to   see  how  it  works.  And  u  yeah,  let's  go   to  Q&A.  And  of  course,  you  get  the  money   line,  you  get  the  money  scanner  in   Bulmania  and  so  on  so  forth.  So  the  the   way  to  get  all  of  that  is  bulmania.com.   Let's  go,  guys.  Let's  go.  Let's  go.   Let's  go.  Oh,  let's  actually  check  some   Tesla.   I  believe  I  believe  we  have  some  new   trend.  Uh  I  just  saw  Jason  in  our  uh  Oh,   yeah.  It's  It's  actually  a  new  trend,   guys.  It's  actually  a  new  trend.  This   one  could  be  very  interesting.  Tesla,   you  can  um  with  mechanical  rules,  stop   loss,  and  so  on  so  forth.  um  position   size  you  have  an  interesting  short  here   uh  to  I  mean  at  least  here  man  at  least   here  it's  7%  with  leverage  more  on  buy   bit  you  can  short  Tesla  with  leverage  on   bit  ununics  like  all  of  these  exchanges   I  use  you  can  you  can  short  with   leverage  and  and  if  uh  uh  uh  obviously  a   stop  loss  if  if  this  goes  goes  against   you  you're  good  but  u  I  mean  if  you  have   a  bit  of  a  more  big  bigger  imagination   you  could  imagine  it  going  to  the  200   week  I  mean  sometimes  it  does  go  to  200   week.  It  went  to  200  week  here  last  year   and  here  it  went  to  200  week  and  here  it   went  to  200  week  and  here  it  went  to   200.  So  I  mean  Tesla  touches  200  week  a   lot.  Okay,  it  touches  it  a  lot.  Here  it   was  some  years  between  it  touched  it.  So   obviously  never  guarantee  but  it  always   goes  eventually  to  200  week.  So  if  you   from  a  bearish  perspective  have  a  bit  of   an  imagination.   Um  well  I  mean  the  first  target  SC  is   here.  You  can  you  can  take  profit  along   the  way  here  7%.  Again  but  leverage  is   more  um  you  have  a  bit  of  support  here.   So  you  let's  say  you  take  a  bit  of  some   chips  off  the  table  here  at  50  week  then   you  can  take  more  chips  off  the  table   here  at  this  support  and  then  you  can   let  the  last  ride  uh  the  the  rest  ride   until  this  uh  200  week.  I  don't  think   we're  going  to  go  much  lower  than  the   200  week.  But  200  week  is  still  31%   away.  So  yeah,  could  be  could  be   interesting.  Let's  see  what's  going  to   happen.   Someone  who's  going  to  be  happy  here  is   Tim  Waltz  because  he  he  was  so  happy  on   the  video  here.  225  and  dropping.  You   guys  remember  at  the  very  very  bottom   here  he  said  Tesla  is  going  to  zero  225   and  dropping   it  and  exploded  up.  He  did  like  a  100%   pump  right  after  team  Waltz.   So  someone  who  would  be  happy  here  is   team  Waltz.  Do  you  guys  call  him  Tampon   team?  Is  that  is  that  correct?  Or  it's   um  uh  or  it's  only  like  super  Trumpers   that  call  him  that.  Or  do  you  if  you   guys  if  you  are  a  Minnesota,  do  you  call   him  that  also  on  like  a  regional  level?   Uh  I  mean  it's  fine.  It's  fine.  I  mean   he  he  had  a  policy.  Why  not  why  not  call   him  what  his  policy  is?  I  mean  maybe  he   he  he  likes  it.  He  likes  it.  I  mean   there's  there's  nothing  wrong  with  that   really  with  the  with  the  word  itself.  So   yeah,  let  let  me  know  guys  what  you   think.   Are  you  bullish  on  any  alts?  No.  Not   now.  In  the  bare  market,  you're  not   bullish  on  any  alts.   You're  not  bullish  on  any  alts.  What   happened  to  Sana  1000?  Since  October,  no   Solana  1000.  Since  October  bare  trend  uh   when  Bitcoin  I  mean,  if  you  haven't  go   to  bull.com/ivan   to  see  to  see  the  the  track  record  what   we've  been  saying.  Uh  in  a  bull  market,   we're  bullish.  When  the  bull  market  is   phenito,   we  we're  bar  since  October.  We're  bar.   We're  bar.  Bara,   someone  asked  about  Bullmania  price.  Go   to  bullmania.com,  watch  the  video,  sign   up  for  the  call.  But  we  have  no  uh  we   don't  have  like  you  know  selfch   checkout,  self-s  serve.  So  uh  you   understand  what  it  means  when  when  there   is  no  price.  It  means  that  it's  not  um   it's  not  like  buying  a  sneakers  bar.   Okay.   I  mean  I  think  when  you  are  in  any  store   and  there  is  no  price,  you  understand   what  it  means.  So  uh  but  watch  the   video.  We're  going  to  explain  everything   and  it  also  depends  on  what  you  need.  Do   you  need  oneonone  uh  coaching  or  not?  Do   you  need  uh  uh  do  you  need  the  access  to   this  and  that?  Depending  on  your  needs,   what  you  need.  Uh  so,  but  it's  not  like   buying  a  chewing  gum.  So,  I  want  you   just  to  be  mentally  prepared.  It's  not   like  buying  a  sneakers  bar  either.  It's   not  even  like  buying  a  Mars  bar  and  also   not  like  buying  a  Milky  Way.  Man,  when  I   was  a  kid,  I  love  Milky  Way.  It's  a  bit   It's  a  bit  above  that,  so  to  speak.  It's   it's  a  bit  above  that.  So,  yeah.  Anyway,   that's  that.   Um,   can  you  look  at  Zcash  where  you  think  it   will  bottom?  Let's  check.  Let's  check.   Let's  check.  Zcash.   Zcash.   I  mean,  now  it's  a  bit  of  a  support,  but   it's  still  bare  trend.  Uh,  where  it's   going  to  bottom  ultimately,  I  think  it's   going  to  bottom  here.  But  guys,  listen,   just  like  the  guy  asked  about  Solana   1000.  We  have  a  lot  of  these  targets  now   that  are  bearish.  If  the  market  turns   before  they  hit  the  target,  we're  also   going  to  be  bullish.  You  know  we  have   the  saying  we  all  we  have  sunglasses   when  it's  sun  okay  if  it's  rain  we  have   umbrella  if  the  sun  goes  away  we  turn  on   the  umbrella  okay  so  the  same  thing  is   here  uh  given  the  current  bare  trend  and   if  especially  if  it  loses  guys  if  it   loses  the  the  50  week  here  the  next   target  is  going  to  be  uh  here  at  70  so   it  is  how  the  chart  looks  I  don't  want   to  like  sugarcoat  it  for  you  it  looks   bad  and  the  the  bare  trend  is  already   since  all  the  way  here  since  400   What  is  it?  24.  So  it  it  looks  bad.  Uh   people  who  ignored  this  uh  they  ignored   it  at  their  own  peril.  How  you  say  it?   Um  and  now  uh  what's  what's  happening?   You  have  uh  50  week  maybe  we  bounce  here   but  it's  basically  currently  if  you  want   to  short  it,  I  would  wait  for  the  break   of  the  50  week  because  it's  this  is   still  support.  I  mean  it  can  easily  go   like  this  and  then  go  down.  Uh  so  you   don't  want  to  be  too  ballsy  yet.  But  it   should  it  start  breaking  here.  It  is.   Yeah.  I  mean,  where  is  the  next  support?   It's  here,  man.  It's  here.  It's  here.   Okay.  So,  just  if  you  want  lowrisk,   lowrisk   trade  setup  kind  of  like  this.  Kind  of   like  this.   That  what  I  would  uh  um  that  that's  how   I  would  play  it.  And  guys,  it's  not  even   crazy.  I  mean,  remember  uh  Zcash  was  70   in  September.  Like,  it's  and  it's  bare   market.  Bitcoin  is  weak.  Like,  the  whole   market  is  weak.  So,  it's  not  even  that   crazy  that  we  go  back  and  we  retrace   this  this  pump.  It's  not  crazy.  I  mean,   we  were  here  just  in  September.  And  for   many  people,  it's  like  news  that  all   coins  can  be  so  volatile,  go  dump,  pump   and  dump.  But  that's  how  all  coins  work.   Even  the  blue  chip  altcoins  work  like   that  because  Sana  went  from  250  to  $8  in   the  last  cycle  and  it's  like  the  most   used  chain  and  and  so  on.  Okay,  it's   like  the  top  fundamental.  I  still  think   eventually  Sana  is  going to  go  to  1,000   once  we  go  into  bull  trend  in  the  next   bull.  like  all  of  the  fundamentals  are   there  for  it  but  at  the  same  time  the   bon  the  price  is  number  one  fundamentals   is  for  guys   to  when  it  comes  to  making  money  is  for   guys  and  I  can  tell  tell  you  that  some   as  someone  who  is  computer  scientist  I   entered  the  space  as  you  know  programmer   thinking  that  I  have  an  age  of  you  know   programming  you  don't  have  an  edge  man   programming  the  only  edge  you  have  is   that  when  you  know  tech  you  know  you   know  programming  is  that  you  know  that   the  project  is  good  like  eventually  it's   going  to  work  out  it  can  take  still   years  so  don't  trade  based  But  as  an   example,  when  people  say  that  Bitcoin  is   captured  by  CIA,  because  I  know  how   Bitcoin  works,  I  can  tell  them  it's   Fugazi.  Bitcoin  can  still  go  down  80%.   So  you  you  don't  trade  based  on   um  based  on  uh  tech,  but  you  can  have   like  a  long-term  conviction  that  and   this  means  that  why  why  is  it  helpful?   Next  time  you  see  a  bull  trend,   fantastic.  You  know  that  it's  it's  good   signal.   Um,  so  yeah,  that's  that.  This  Bitcoin   miners  turned  AI  data  centers,  are  they   bringing  Bitcoin  down?  Would  love  your   take  on  data  center  buildouts,   especially  iron.  Uh,  guys,  I'm  not  too   much  in  the  like  exactly  what  the hell   they're  doing.  Um,  I  think  maybe  James   Invest  Answers  know  it  better.  I  I  don't   know  what  they're  doing  like  what   they're  building.  I  because  I  I  don't   trade  on  fundamentals  as  you  I  trade   based  on  chart  um  and  um  uh  because  I   know  you  know  in  the  past  I  I'm  in   crypto  since  2013  trying  to  understand   what  is  just  wast  waste  of  time  just   look  at  the  chart  so  looking  at  iron  uh   what  what  happens  um  I  mean  not  too  bad   it's  a  bit  of  uh  a  bit  of  bull  trend  but   very  bad  because  it  it's  sideways  it's   chopping  sideways  u  I  would  say  this  is   a  non-tradable  chart  before  it  breaks   this  50  week  I  think  the  next  logical   ical  step  for  it  is  to  go  here.  It's   sealed  another  25%  down  and  then  yeah   should  you  go  below  it  it's  very  bad   then  yeah  you  can  then  you  can  uh  look   at  this  levels  here  that  uh  you  yeah  to   short  basically  here  uh  from  here  to   here  but  yeah  guys  whether  they're   building  out  this  and  that  is  also  the   problem  you  analyze  the  company  then   they  change  their  mind  just  like  you  say   you  know  people  spend  so  much  time   analyzing  they're  going  to  do  this   they're  going  to  do  that  then  they   change  their  mind  well  you  spend  so  much   time  you  could  have  just  followed   mechanical  rules  and  looked  at  the  chart   But  I  could  have  told  you  already  if   someone  because  you  know  they  do  this.  I   don't  care  because  someone  is  clearly   selling  here.  Okay.  Someone  clearly  sold   like  a  mfer  like  a  like  a  mother  effer.   Okay.  Here.  Okay.  They  sold  a  lot  here.   They  sold  a  lot  here.  Okay.  That's  all  I   need  to  know.  That's  all  I  need  to  know.   Whether  they  affect  Bitcoin.  I  think   they  affect  Bitcoin.  They  don't  affect   Bitcoin.  Bitcoin  works  on  its  own  uh   price  trend.  It's  going  to  bottom  out   eventually.  So  whatever  these  guys  do   will  not  affect  any  of  that.  I  can  tell   you  that  with  almost  100%  certainty  that   whatever  iron  does  will  not  affect   Bitcoin.   Bitcoin  is  the  ocean.  This  iron  is  like   a  small  ship.   Anyway,  hope  it  gives  you  some  some  uh   uh  yeah  understanding.  I  think  the  the   biggest  thing  I  want  to  tell  you  is  to   uh  I  mean  focus  on  signal.  People  have   too  much  information.  They  they  focus  so   much  on  information.  I  actually  have   this  in  my  book.  By  the  way  guys,  you   know  that  I'm  writing  a  book.  I  told   you.   Let  let  me  see.  There  is  one  of  the   traps  is  information  overload.  Okay.   More  information  should  be  better   decisions,  right?  So  Bullmania  book  is   coming  soon  guys.  So  stay  tuned  for  the   book.  If  you  want  to  not  miss  it,  go  to   the  newsletter  in  the  description.  Okay.   So,  uh  look  here  more  information  uh   information  overload.  Uh  more   information  should  mean  better   decisions,  right?  Wrong.  People  fall   into  a  trap  of  endless  consumption.  You   know,  reading  this,  reading  that.  Uh   they  watch  YouTube  videos  for  hours   every  day.  Well,  you  should  you  should   watch  my  YouTube  other  ones.  I  don't   know  if  you  should  watch  too  many   YouTubers  guys  because  they  if  they  tell   you  things  which  are  not  good  trading  u   like  not  good  investing  or  not  good   trading  or  they  they  harvest  views.  So,   it  it  will  ruin  you.  It  will  ruin  you.   So,  watch  my  YouTube.  The  other  ones  be   very  selective  and  look  at  what  they   actually  did  for  you.  Scroll  through   Twitter  obsessively,  join  Discord  server   like  they  subscribe  to  newsletters  and   follow  dozens  of  analysts  which  all  say   different  things.  They  think  that  if   they  just  consume  enough  information,   they  finally  will  understand  what's   happening  in  the  market.  Instead  instead   they  end  up  paralyzed  or  they  they  have   even  worse  like  a  wrong  signal.   Different  sources  give  conflicting   opinions.  One  analyst  says  buy,  another   say  sell.  One  newsletter  is  bullish,   another  is  bearish.  The  more  you   consume,  the  more  confused  you  become.   So  anyway,  for  the  full  book,  go  to  the   newsletter,  okay?  Go  to  the  newsletter.   So  when  is  the  book  coming?  It  should   come,  guys.  I  I'm  I'm  finalizing  it.  I'm   finalizing  it.  Should  come  I  hope  to   finalize  it  in  um  in  February.  So  but  I   still  need  to  figure  out  how,  you  know,   printing  works  because  I  want  I  I  don't   want  just,  you  know,  PDF.  I  want  to  have   a  real  freaking  nice  book.  It's  heavy,   man.  It's  heavy.  I  can  hold  it  here.  I   can  have  it  in  the  bookshelf.  It  needs   to  be  heavy.  It  needs  to  be  nice.  need   to  test  a  lot  of  this  printer  printer   companies  still.  So  we're  going  to  we're   going  to  experiment  a  bit  but  I  I  think   in  March  for  sure  we're  going  to  have  it   and  the  best  thing  you  know  having  the   book  is  is  going  to  man  it's  going  to   save  you  so  much.  It's  going  to  save  you   so  much.  Can  I  just  buy  the  digital?   It's  possible  to  buy  the  digital   version.  It's  it  will  be  possible.   You  so  crypto  is  basically  that.  No  no   no no  no.  I  mean  okay  I'm  only  sure  that   you  guys  are  getting  the  correct   picture.  I'm  very  bullish  crypto  but  uh   you  need  to  understand  that  it's  uh  b   being  bullish  crypto  and  loving  crypto   is  not  the  same  as  taking  care  of  your   portfolio  because  again  many  cryptos  go   down  a  lot  most  of  them  will  not  come   back  bit  will  come  back  so  I'm  bullish   towards  the  end  of  the  year  it's   absolutely  not  dead  people  who  say  it's   dead  are  the  same  people  who  said  to  buy   the  dip  here  when  we  told  you  to  sell   they're  very  emotion  like  they  don't   know  markets  too  much  um  so  they  they   tell  you  it's  dead  now  uh  you  know   bitcoin  failed  this  and  that  I'm  very   bullish  Bitcoin  towards  the  end  of  the   year  guys.  I  think  here  I  mean  man  if  we   can  get  here  to  40  is  going to  be   fantastic.  But  here's  the  buy  zone.  The   buy  zone  is  starting  already  like  we're   right  binding  on  the  door  of  the  buy   zone.  So  I'm  very  bullish.  That's  why  I   have  the  buy  zone  here  guys.  Even  though   I  expect  it  to  go  lower  because  it  would   be  a  shame  not  to  nibble  a  bit  in  case   we  get  a  rocket  booster  up  which  could   theoretically  happen.  I  think  it's  a  low   chance  but  I  want  to  hedge  that  low   chance  with  uh  nibbling  a  bit  here.  Very   slow  nibble  like  a  a  few%  per  week  max   max.  The  big  big  buying  is  going  to   happen  once  we  turn  bullish  on  the  money   line  like  once  we  cross  the  money  line.   Currently  it  is  91k  but  it's  dropping   quickly.  So  within  a  few  weeks  it's   enough  maybe  that  we  go  to  60k  and  it's   bullish.  So  let's  see.  Okay  not  few   weeks  probably  a  few  months.  Probably   it's  going  to  take  until  se  summer  maybe   September  for  us  to  get  the  money  line   down  like  this.  So  that's  that  guys.   Listen  we  are  at  50  minutes.

    "summary_hu": "A videóban a Bitcoin jelenlegi árfolyamát elemzik, mely éppen a vásárlási zónához közelít, és várják, hogy akár 40 000 dollárra is csökkenhet. A 200 hetes mozgóátlagra való hivatkozás alapján az előrejelzés optimista, mert historikusan ez erős támaszt jelent. A narrátor hangsúlyozza a lassú, fokozatos vásárlás fontosságát a jelenlegi piaci környezetben, és arra figyelmeztet, hogy a félelem és a kapzsiság indexe alacsony, ami tovább csökkentheti az árakat. A Solana, XRP és ETH árfolyamának alakulására is kitérnek, külön kiemelve az alacsony támogatású érme kereskedésének lehetőségeit. A végeredmény az, hogy a piaci helyzet kihívásokat tartogat, de a hosszú távú kilátások kedvezők lehetnek.",

Referring to the 200-week moving average as a crucial support level, the analysis is optimistic, as historically this trend provides strong support. The narrator emphasizes the importance of slow, incremental buying in the current market context and warns that the fear and greed index is low, which could further depress prices. The discussion also covers the price movements of Solana, XRP, and ETH, highlighting trading opportunities in coins with low support. Ultimately, while the market presents challenges, long-term prospects may be favorable.",
