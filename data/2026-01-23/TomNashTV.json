        "transcript": "Hey folks, this is Tom Nash. Welcome to another video. And in this video, we're talking about a stock that might have the biggest potential of anything we have ever covered on this channel, Palunteer included. Now, over the past few years, we have made a lot of money in the stock market. And the secret is very, very simple. And if you ask the retail investor, the average long-term retail investor, what is the secret to making money? They're going to get it wrong. They're going to give you a partial answer, which is buy good companies and hold for long. That is not a bad answer and it might be a good answer to making some money in the stock market. But that is not the secret to making generational wealth like we did with Palunteer. The secret is actually very simple. Buy good companies which are undervalued, mispriced, and then you get to make a lot of money. For example, on January 1st, 2023, you could have bought Palanteer at $6, which was heavily undervalued. Now, if you look at the market price right now, you've made a couple thousand% on that specific investment. Now, at the same time, you could have bought a great company, Microsoft, undoubtedly one of the best businesses in the world. You could have bought it at $250 a pop, right? Right now, it means you done 100% on your investment in that same time frame. My whole thing, my whole philosophy, thesis is finding great businesses, but businesses that are somehow misunderstood and completely mispriced by the market. Now, a lot of you think that when I'm saying that I'm looking for undervalued, misunderstood, mispriced companies, I'm going to be looking for companies with low price to earnings ratio, low PE. A PE ratio on a standalone basis is meaningless. It has to be taken into account along with everything else about the company. Let's look at Nvidia at the same date, January 1st, 2023, half a trillion dollar company. Guess what? Since then, it has done a thousand%. It doesn't matter what is the historical prices. It doesn't matter what's the P ratio. None of this matters. If you have these two factors, meaning the company is terrific, the business is great, and it's misunderstood and mispriced. No matter how high the P ratio is, you're going to end up making a lot of money. That's how the stock market works. And now, let's get to the main event, the company we're here to talk about. Now, check this out. The S&P 500 over the past 5 years have made a incredible return, 80%. Absolute wowzer, right? But not as good as Nvidia, not as good as Palanteer, not as good as some of these names which are flying high right now. And that's fine. The S&P 500 isn't designed to beat Nvidia and Palanteer. But here's the deal. If I showed you a company which is a big cap massive huge company that over the same time completely lagged the S&P 500 for five years but somehow has 275 increase in free cash flow over that time. Its free cash flow by the way 7 billion it has reduced its debt by almost 10% at the same time. It has increased its revenue by 240%. And its operating income, the margin increased by 150%. That company is somehow lagging the S&P 500 over the past 5 years, which is crazy. It has done about 55 to 60% while S&P 500 did 80%. Now, let's assume I presented this case to you and I said, \"Look, folks, this company is getting better exponentially over the past 5 years. You've seen the numbers, but somehow it has lagged the S&P 500 for the past 5 years by 25%. What gives? You would have all said, \"Hey, it's a pretty sweet deal.\" And I agree. The company we're talking about today is Tesla, ticker TSLA, a company that is a part of my own portfolio. About 20% of my portfolio is in Tesla. And somehow over the past 5 years, Tesla has been the worst part of my portfolio as far as performance. It has been the weakest point. Pilenteer did great. S&P 500 even beat Tesla and Tesla's lack behind even though it was positive but not as good. Now on Stock MVP, if you go to stock-mpp.com, a platform I built for you so you can analyze any stock within a few seconds and a platform you can try out for free for a whole week on stockpard. And if you run Tesla through a fundamental scorecard, you're going to find out that this stock is currently 80 out of 100. One of the best scores we have on the platform. Now, if you actually look a little bit deeper, you find out that in about 10% more institutional ownership and about 5% more margin, the company goes from 80 to 90 score, which is one of the highest by far we've ever seen. All that with about 2% of short interest, which means nobody in their right mind is shorting Tesla. They kind of learned their lesson in the past 5 years, which means one thing. We have that setup. We've been hunting for the great business that keeps getting better and is extremely solid fundamentally along with a mispricing because if you look at Tesla even for the past year when the S&P did like 17% it has absolutely stagnated. So when a business keeps getting better, as Peter Lynch said, there's always 100% correlation between the quality of a business and the share price in the long term. That catchup is going to have to happen and at some point the rubber band effect is going to take place and the share price is going to catch up with the fundamentals and long-term investors will be rewarded, will make a lot of money. But the thing with Tesla is not just about the catch-up as far as the lag in the share price. It's also about the future. If you look into 2030, if you look into 2035, if you look at the biggest secular trends right now in the market, Tesla is primed to be one of the best performing companies into 2030 into 2035 and it's not even close. So, what am I talking about? Well, Tesla is currently being priced or rather mispriced based on stagnating revenues over the past year as far as auto sales, which means that a lot of investors are assuming that Tesla is on the way down because auto sales aren't growing as fast and because margins are compressing, mainly because of competition from China. And that is why the stock price hasn't done nothing over the past year. Now, here's the thing. If you look at these issues, softening EV demand, the margins or maybe even Elon is bad narrative or maybe even the DP ratio is too high. This is a wrong perception. This is a misconception and this is a misunderstanding of Tesla and somehow shockingly in 2026 it's happening again and people refuse to take advantage of this opportunity. They refuse to look at Tesla for what it is. Now what Tesla is is very evident if you just zoom out. And if you actually do zoom out, you find out that Tesla is focused on three main areas right now. And those areas are robo taxi and full self-driving, that's one. Human robotics, which is two, and energy, which is three. Now, it sounds like some sort of a blue sky scenario, but it couldn't be further from the truth. Now, here's the thing. It's not about cars. It's not about margins. It's about these three elements, or maybe four if you separate FSD and robo taxi. Now, think about it for a second. Where is the world heading? Forget about Tesla for a second. Where is the world heading in the next 10 years? You know, you're witnessing right now in Davos, the speeches coming out, the del globalization and all this beef going on within Europe and the US. Where is this world heading to? Well, obviously we're going to have the biggest trend over the next 5 10 years, which is going to be AI for sure, right? Number two, labor shortages in the West as far as demographics, the shortages in employment when it comes to factory jobs, undesired jobs. Let's put it this way. Of course, you have the energy angle for data centers, for infrastructure, for the grid. We've talked about it multiple times. But on top of it, you have other things that are going on. For example, you have tech convergence. The automobile is now a telephone, and a telephone and an automobile is now an alarm clock. And it's also a toothbrush. Everything is becoming one. One app for everything, one device for everything. There's convergence. Okay. On top of this, we have national security concerns now. We're starting to beef with everybody. So, a lot of that will come into play with del globalization, with repatriation of production, the chips act, etc., etc. What about capital efficiency? The chase after the perfect margin couldn't be more harsh than it is in 2025, 2026. So, capital efficiency is going to be there. What about urbanization and mobility? All that is in play. And what about all of these things coming together into one company that literally sitting on that particular juncture for every single mega secular trend I just told you about that is Tesla. If you look at human robotics, I don't think people understand how big this market is going to get. It is probably the biggest mega secular trend of our generation. We have never seen anything like this maybe in history. We're talking about a hundred billion dollar market by 2030. That's not that far. We're talking about factory workers, logistics, food and supply, hospitality, home robotics. It is insane. And the company that has number one, the money to go into this because this ain't cheap as far as capex, as far as R&D, 40 billion in the bank. It has the crazy CEO that's willing to spend that money because it's crazy enough to chase greatness. And you have the best talent in the business, that's Tesla. On top of it, you have expertise in battery tech, Tesla. You have expertise in vision sensors, Tesla. You have expertise in electric motors, Tesla. You have expertise as far as building a global supply chain, Tesla. As far as factories to train these human robots and also to showcase how good they are, Tesla. On top of it, if you actually launch these robotics, it's not just about selling the hardware. What about the software? It's the printer model with the ink. We're talking about SAS margins, software as a service margin. That's 80% margin sum robotics. That is insane. What about FSD, full self-driving, autonomy, cybercap, robo taxi, whatever you want to call it. It is near perfection. If you had a chance to experience, and if you hadn't, I highly recommend you do. This thing is pretty much near perfect, right? So, we're talking about the Austin Pilot basically being a smashing success. This thing works. But the thing is, it works at a fraction of the cost of all these other competitors, which invest massive, massive capital into every single unit they launch. This ain't global ice. You can't launch it in every city. Like, the costs are insane. You're not going to map every single city. On the other hand, Tesla, you had some guys years ago hacked a Tesla and released FSD somewhere in Ukraine. This thing go on like perfect, right? So, the costs are ginormously smaller than any of the competition. Nobody comes close. But also, the mileage, the automakers, they're not going to be able to catch up because Tesla has the miles and the costs. And once Tesla crosses the finish line first, the incentive to build one just goes away because you essentially can lease it from Tesla, which they all will do. Tesla will become a monopoly in autonomous driving. That's inevitable. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. Now, by 2030, Tesla will be a monopoly in robotics, in human robotics, essentially in FSD, in autonomy, and in robo taxi. That's pretty obvious. Now, those industries alone are exponentially more valuable than anything Tesla has done so far, which is funny to me that people think Tesla's expensive. On top of it, you have to consider the fact that with data centers, with energy becoming a huge deal for the next 5, 10 years and all the stuff we have to put into infrastructure and storage and energy delivery. Ask yourself how important will megapex be in that world. It is another ginormous industry for Tesla. Tesla megapex already the hottest thing in the market as far as energy storage. Imagine this. Now, I think Tesla energy is going to be one of the biggest areas for Tesla over the next 5 10 years. It will be bigger than the auto business for sure, but let's get to it slowly. So in 2026, if we look back, Tesla has annual revenues of about $und00 billion. My math shows me that by 2030, that number is going to be in 500, maybe 550. Depends on how things play out. Basically 5x from here. And you know what they say? The share price always follows the earnings and always follows the fundamentals. So, if Tesla 5xes its revenues from here to 2030, I'm not too worried about the share price because long-term the fundamentals always win. And here's how I see things playing out. As far as robo taxi goes, 2 million vehicles, 50k miles per vehicle at$120, that's $120 billion right there. On top of it, FSD at 10 million vehicles, 150 a pop per month. That's about 18 billion in revenues annually. Robotics, 2 million deployed, about $30 billion in revenue. at 10K hardware, 5K software, energy 2030, 500 gawatt deployed. I know it sounds crazy, but trust me, the world is going to need that. 250 per gigawatt, we're talking about $125 billion in revenue just from energy. Remember when Elon told you 5 years ago, energy is going to be bigger than the automotive business. But he wasn't talking about 2030 because by 2030, the automotive business is going to make north of $200 billion at 220 with services. And that's how we get to $500 billion in revenue by 2030. And if that triggers you or that annoys you, good. It gets you to think. I love that. But if it triggers you to hear my 2030 numbers, my 2035 numbers are going to blow a gasket for you. My 2035 revenue estimate for Tesla is $2.5 trillion per year. A lot of people just got annoyed, right? But check this out. You haven't heard my price targets for 5 years and for 10 years. And that really is going to piss you off. Okay? These are my models. 5-year, $1,800, bare case, that's a 308% increase in share price. Medium case 2030, $3,300. That's a 650% increase in share price. And bull case, $4,800, which means a,000% from here by 2030. Now 2035, it gets even spicier. 2035 bare case 3750 which means 760% upside middle case 2035 $5600 which is $1,200%. And 2035 bull case is $7,900 which is 1,700% of upside on the share price. I expect a palunteer moment to happen to Tesla. And it sounds crazy because the company's already above a trillion dollar valuation. But when you have a great business that keeps on getting better and a stagnating price, that always happens. Just like it happened with Palunteer, it's going to happen with Tesla. Now, the worst thing you can do from this point on is to take this video and jump head first into an empty pool. That's going to be stupid. That would be the equivalent of going right now, mortgaging your house, and buying Tesla tomorrow with everything you got because Tom said these are his target prices for 2030, 2035. Now, there's a lot of risks with Tesla short term. Warren Buffett famously said cash is the safest short-term stocks are the most dangerous. Long-term, it reverses. With Tesla, it couldn't be more true. There's a lot of short-term risk for Tesla. Big drops are very, very possible, and they will happen. You don't want to lose your firepower right now going in at this price. Slow. Okay. There will be delays. There will be bad news. Elon Musk will probably say some stupid stuff. There will be a very violent journey just like it always been with Tesla. The path is by definition 100% going to be very very chaotic and messy. Okay. The only thing you can do here is DCA. DCA turns this volatility into money. With DCA, we've increased what we made on Palunteer exponentially because we use the downturns to decrease our cost bases. We double down DCA at the right moments. Constant buying with increased parameters and decrease parameters on the way down, on the way up. Everything I just told you right now may sound like crazy talk to you, but this is how it works. This is how you make money in the stock market. Now, I have a full guide which you can get right now.
