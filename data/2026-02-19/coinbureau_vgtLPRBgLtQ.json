    "transcript": "Everyone  kept  waiting  for  retail   investors  to  flood  back  into  crypto  and   pump  altcoins  to  the  moon.  We  were  told   that  once  Bitcoin  broke  all-time  highs,   the  retail  horde  would  kick  down  the   doors  and  send  everything  else  flying.   But  well,  that  didn't  happen,   >> did  it?  Even  when  Bitcoin  hit  new   all-time  highs  in  October  2025,  retail   interest  didn't  show  up  in  size.  And  uh   here's  the  uncomfortable  truth  that   nobody  wants  to  admit.  Retail  investors   didn't  disappear.  They  didn't  stop   gambling.  They  just  found  new  casinos.   And  right  now,  those  casinos  are  eating   crypto's  lunch.  From  the  explosion  of   prediction  markets  to  the  sports  betting   mania  to  the  trading  of  options  on  tech   stocks  on  Robin  Hood,  uh  the  speculative   capital  that  used  to  fuel  altcoin   seasons  is  flowing  elsewhere.  Retail  has   checked  out  of  the  tech  thesis  and   checked  into  the  casino.  But  is  this   permanent?  And  what  does  it  mean  for   your  portfolio  if  the  retail  wave  never   comes  back?  That  is  exactly  what  we  are   diving  into  today.  My  name  is  Nick  and   you're  watching  the  Coin  Bureau.  First   things  first,  let's  look  at  the  evidence   because  the  numbers  are  quite  frankly   shocking.  The  narrative  some  continue  to   pedal  on  X  is  that  we  are  just  one  green   candle  away  from  the  2021  style  mania.   But  if  you  look  at  the  actual  data,   retail  participation  is  sitting  near  a   multi-year  low.  Take  Coinbase  for   example.  their  monthly  transacting   users,  the  key  metric  for  retail   engagement,  are  down  significantly  from   their  2021  peak  of  11.4  million.  By  late   2025,  that  number  had  dropped  to  around   7.8  million.  And  it's  not  just  users   leaving,  it's  the  volume.  Exchange   volume  data  shows  that  retail   participation  has  effectively  vanished.   In  the  second  quarter  of  2025  alone,   trading  volume  on  top  exchanges  dropped   by  over  27%,  wiping  out  $1.5  trillion  in   activity.  And  the  smoking  gun  comes  from   Robin  Hood's  latest  earnings  report.   Robin  Hood  released  their  Q4  2025   earnings  in  February  2026,  and  it  was  a   bloodbath  for  crypto.  While  their   options  and  equities  revenue  climbed,   cryptocurrency  revenue  plummeted  38%   yearover-year  to  just  $221  million.   Think  about  that.  Bitcoin  was  trading   near  all-time  highs.  Yet,  the  average   Robin  Hood  user,  the  ultimate  retail   proxy,  was  trading  less  crypto,  not   more.  And  if  you  think  that's  bad,  just   look  at  Google  Trends.  Interest  in  the   term  buy  Bitcoin  is  sitting  at  a  score   of  11.  Now,  for  context,  it  was  at  100   in  2017  and  45  in  2021.  The  general   public  simply  does  not  care.  They  aren't   searching  for  how  to  buy  crypto  or  best   altcoins.  They've  moved  on.  So,  where   did  they  go?  Did  they  suddenly  become   responsible  savers  putting  their  money   into  index  funds?   >> Of  course  not.   >> They  didn't  stop  speculating.  They  just   swapped  their  exchanges  for  prediction   markets.  Point  number  two  is  the  rise  of   the  event  contract.  Platforms  like  Poly   Market  and  Kelshi  have  absolutely   exploded  in  popularity.  We're  talking   about  a  130fold  increase  in  monthly   trading  volume  from  early  2024  to  the   end  of  2025.  Total  notional  trading   volume  across  these  platforms  hit  over   $44  billion  in  2025.  Kelshi  alone  saw   its  user  base  grow  from  600,000  to  5.1   million  in  under  12  months.  That's  an   8.5  times  increase.  And  it  makes  perfect   sense.  For  Gen  Z  and  millennials,   betting  on  elections,  Fed  interest  rate   decisions,  or  geopolitical  events  feels   a  lot  more  tangible  than  betting  on  a   layer  2  rollup  or  a  governance  token.  It   offers  the  same  adrenaline  rush,  the   same  volatile  odds,  and  the  same   potential  for  quick  windfalls,  but  the   outcome  is  based  on  realworld  events   they  actually  understand.  Why  wait  4   years  for  a  crypto  cycle  to  play  out   when  you  can  just  bet  on  the  outcome  of   a  court  case  or  a  football  game  and  get   paid  out  tonight?  And  uh  speaking  of   football,  that  brings  us  to  the  biggest   competitor  crypto  has  ever  faced,   legalized  sports  betting.  Since  the  US   Supreme  Court  opened  the  floodgates,   billions  of  dollars  have  poured  into   apps  like  DraftKings  and  FanDuel.  In   2025  alone,  Americans  legally  wagered   nearly  $150  billion  on  sports.   DraftKings  reported  over  $6  billion  in   revenue  for  fiscal  year  2025,  up  27%   year-over-year.  And  the  scary  part  for   crypto,  the  dopamine  loop  is  identical.   You  open  an  app,  you  see  volatile  odds,   you  place  a  bet,  and  you  get  instant   results.  But  there  is  one  key   difference.  Sports  betting  has   mainstream  acceptance  and  zero  learning   curves.  You  don't  need  to  understand   private  keys,  gas  fees,  or  bridging  to   arbitum  to  bet  on  the  Super  Bowl.  You   just  download  the  app  and  hit  place  bet.   And  retail  loves  the  high-risk,   highreward  stuff.  Parlay  betting,  where   you  chain  multiple  bets  together  for   massive  potential  payouts,  now  makes  up   over  35%  of  total  sports  book  volume.   And  that  is  the  exact  same  psychological   itch  that  altcoin  speculation  used  to   scratch.  The  moonshot  mentality  hasn't   left.  It's  just  migrated  to  a  different   app.  Now,  before  we  get  into  the  one   area  of  crypto  that  is  still  seeing   retail  action,  I  want  to  mention   something  important  about  keeping  up   with  these  shifts.  The  market  is   changing  faster  than  ever.  And  if  you   are  still  using  a  2021  playbook  in  2026,   you  are  going  to  get  left  behind.  And   that  is  why  we've  got  the  Coin  Bureau   Telegram  channel.  It's  over  here  where   we  share  the  latest  breaking  news,   provide  deep  dive  alpha  and  actionable   market  updates  every  single  day  pinged   directly  to  your  mobile  device  so  you   don't  miss  a  thing.

Okay,  back  to   the  crypto  casino  because  there  is  one   sector  that  retail  hasn't  abandoned.  In   fact,  they  are  doubling  down.  Memecoins.   The  only  crypto  sector  still  attracting   some  retail  volume  is  the  one  that  makes   zero  pretense  about  being  quote   technology.  Platforms  like  Pump.  Fun   have  generated  hundreds  of  millions  in   revenue  by  allowing  anyone  to  launch  a   token  in  seconds.  At  its  peak  in  early   2025,  Pump.  Fun  was  pulling  in  over  $250   million  in  quarterly  revenue.  It  became   a  factory  for  churning  out  new  tokens.   But  here  is  the  kicker.  Less  than  1%  of   those  tokens  ever  graduate  or  maintain   any  value.  It  is  pure  gambling.  Retail   has  spoken  clearly.  They  were  never  here   for  decentralized  finance  or  the  future   of  supply  chain  logistics.  They  were   here  to  gamble  and  now  the  mask  is  off.   They  prefer  the  honesty  of  a  memecoin  to   the  false  promises  of  a  quote  utility   token.  But  even  this  sector  is  burning   people  out.  We  saw  the  Trump  memecoin   scandal  where  retail  investors  lost   nearly  $2  billion  while  insiders  cashed   out  $320  million  in  fees.  We  saw  the   celebrity  token  meta  collapse  with  coins   down  98  or  99%.   This  nihilism  is  creating  a  trust   deficit  that  is  hard  to  recover  from.   And  that  leads  us  to  the  next  massive   problem,  VC  fatigue.  Retail  investors   are  exhausted.  They're  tired  of  being   used  as  exit  liquidity  for  venture   capital  firms.  A  report  from  Momento   Research  tracked  118  major  token   launches  in  2025  and  found  that  nearly   85%  of  them  are  underwater.  If  you   bought  a  VC  back  token  at  launch  in   2025,  the  median  loss  was  over  70%.  We   all  know  the  game  by  now.  Projects   launch  with  a  low  float  and  a  high  fully   diluted  valuation.  The  VC  gets  in  at   pennies.  The  token  launches  at  billions.   And  then  the  unlocks  start  hitting  the   market,  drowning  retail  buyers  in   supply.  Why  would  retail  investors  buy  a   quote  tech  token  knowing  that  there  are   billions  of  dollars  of  locked  tokens   waiting  to  be  dumped  on  their  head?  They   wouldn't,  and  they  aren't.  They  would   rather  bet  on  a  football  game  where  they   know  the  odds  are  at  least  transparent   or  just  buy  a  memecoin  where  everyone   knows  it's  just  a  pure  gamble.  So  what   does  this  mean  for  the  market  structure   right  now?   >> So  what  does  this  mean?   >> Well,  it  explains  why  Bitcoin  dominance   is  hovering  near  60%  which  is  multi-year   highs.  The  institutional  and  retail   money  flowing  into  the  market  through   ETFs  is  sticking  to  Bitcoin  and   Ethereum.  Black  Rockck's  clients  aren't   buying  your  favorite  small  cap   governance  token.  We've  seen  over  $56   billion  in  cumulative  inflows  into   Bitcoin  ETFs,  but  that  money  is   structurally  walled  off.  It  doesn't   rotate.  In  previous  cycles,  profits  from   Bitcoin  would  flow  into  Ethereum  and   then  into  the  high  caps  and  then  into   the  low  caps.  But  that  trickle  down   effect  is  broken  because  ETF  investors   are  not  cryptonatives.  They  are  passive   allocators.  And  this  leaves  altcoins  in   a  dangerous  spot.  Without  a  fresh  wave   of  retail  speculation  to  buy  the  bags,   technology  focused  altcoins  are  bleeding   against  Bitcoin.  The  altcoin  season   index  is  sitting  at  25  out  of  100.  We   are  in  deep  Bitcoin  season  and  without   retail,  there  is  no  catalyst  to  flip  the   switch.  So,  is  it  all  over?  Is  retail   gone  forever?  Well,  not  necessarily,  but   the  return  path  is  very  narrow.  Retail   usually  comes  back  for  two  reasons.  And   one  is  the  wealth  effect  from  making   money  elsewhere  like  stocks  or  housing   that  then  rotates  into  crypto  risk.  Or   two,  a  full-blown  mania  that  dominates   headlines  and  creates  lots  of  FOMO.   Right  now,  neither  is  happening.  The   Federal  Reserve  is  the  wild  card,   though.  If  they  cut  rates  aggressively   in  2026  and  liquidity  floods  the  system,   we  might  see  a  resurgence.  But  hoping   for  the  Fed  to  save  your  altcoin  bags  is   not  a  strategy.   >> What's  the  verdict?   >> To  be  blunt,  the  crypto  market  has   matured.  But  in  doing  so,  it  has  lost   its  primary  engine  of  volatility,  the   retail  gambler.  Those  people  have  moved   on  to  faster,  simpler  games  like  Kelshi,   DraftKings,  and  Memecoins.  The  days  of   everything  pumping  together  are   unfortunately  behind  us.  The  market  is   bifocating.  You  have  Bitcoin  and   Ethereum  as  institutional  assets.  You   have  memecoins  as  the  retail  casino.  And   you  have  the  massive  middle  class  of   utility  tokens  that  are  struggling  to   find  a  buyer.  If  your  portfolio  depends   on  a  wave  of  retail  investors  coming   back  to  buy  your  Ethereum  killer  or  your   decentralized  Airbnb  token,  you  might  be   waiting  a  long  time.   >> I've  been  waiting  a  long  time.   >> Unfortunately,  the  retail  crowd  isn't   reading  white  papers  anymore.  They're   checking  the  spreads  on  the  Chiefs  game.   But  uh  what  do  you  think?  Are  you  seeing   your  friends  leave  crypto  for  sports   betting?  Or  do  you  think  the  retail  wave   is  just  around  the  corner?  Let  me  know   in  the  comments  down  below.  And  if  you   want  to  know  more  about  what  specific   altcoin  sectors  might  actually  survive   this  purge,  you  can  check  out  our  video   on  that  right  over  here.  And  if  you  want   to  understand  the  full  impact  of  Bitcoin   ETFs  on  this  cycle,  then  check  out  that   video  right  over  here.  Okay,  that's  all   from  me  today.  Thank  you  guys  very  much   for  watching  and  I'll  see  you  again   soon.  This  is  Nick  signing  off.",

    "summary_hu": "A videó bemutatja, hogy a kiskereskedelmi befektetők a kriptovaluták világából a szerencsejáték irányába tolódtak el, ami a piaci részvétel csökkenéséhez vezetett. A Bitcoin 2025-ös rekordmagasságai ellenére a kiskereskedelmi érdeklődés nem tért vissza, mivel a befektetők más spekulatív lehetőségeket találtak. A hagyományos kriptókkal szembeni érdeklődés hiánya a memecoinok iránti kereslet növekedésével és a sportfogadási platformok felfutásával magyarázható. A Robinhood adatai is alátámasztják a trendet, hiszen a krypto bevétel drámai csökkenést mutatott. Az új piaci struktúra jellemzője, hogy a Bitcoin és az Ethereum dominál, míg a technológia alapú altcoinok szenvednek a likviditás hiánya miatt. A jövőbeni kilábalás esélye szűk, és a kiskereskedelmi befektetők esetleges visszatérését egy gazdasági fellendülés vagy egy újabb kripto-láz hozhatja el.",
    "summary_en": "The transcript reveals that retail investors have shifted from the cryptocurrency market to more traditional gambling activities, leading to decreased market participation. Despite Bitcoin reaching new highs in 2025, retail interest has not returned as speculators have found alternative avenues. The lack of traditional crypto engagement is attributed to a growing demand for memecoins and the rise of sports betting platforms. Data from Robinhood supports this trend, as cryptocurrency revenue has dramatically decreased. The new market structure is characterized by Bitcoin and Ethereum dominance, while technology-based altcoins suffer from a lack of liquidity. The potential for a future comeback of retail investors appears narrow, dependent on either an economic upturn or another crypto mania.",
