    "transcript": "Let's  go,  guys.  Let's  go.  Let's  go.   Let's  go.  Oh,  yes.  So,  yes,  so  yes,   guys.  Welcome  to  another  episode.  And  as   you can  see  right  now,  Bitcoin  is   currently  still  at  67  and  we  are  using   this  big  fat  support  from  2024   as  the  last  chance  to  save  us  from  the   papa.  I  mean,  Bitcoin  is  coming  to  Papa   guys.  As  you  know,  it  is  200  week  moving   average.  It  is  currently  at  around  57.   But  if  we  break  this  support,  if  we  lose   this  support  currently  at  around  6667,   we're  going  lower.  We're  going  lower   towards  the  40k  level.  Maybe  even  we're   going  to  dip  a  bit  below  40k  level.  I   have  this  green  chart  like  uh  right  here   that  shows  you  how  a  potential  scenario   may  look  like  for  the  remainder  of  the   year.  Although  we  don't  know  exactly  how   it's  going  to  get  here  towards  4C.  If  we   lose,  guys,  if  we  lose  this  support,   that's  the  trajectory.  If  we  get  a   bounce  here,  we  can  expect  Bitcoin  to   potentially  come  back  here  into  the  90K   area,  86,  87,  like  high  80s,  maybe  even   get  into  the  range.  But  for  now,  guys,   the  path  of  least  resistance  is  still   down.  We  have  to  be  up  front.  It's  still   down.  If  we  start  breaking  it,  guys,  if   we  start  breaking  this  uh  this  support,   which  is  basically  where  we  are   currently,  if  we  really  start  going   below  it,  you  can  put  fantastic   fantastic  shorts.  Currently  still  the   shortest  market.  Uh  let's  see  how  we  can   draw  this  in  a  nice  way.  We  have  a   support  area  here  which  we're  currently   which  we're  currently  testing.  Should  we   break  below  it  guys?  It's  not  going  to   be  pretty.  For  bulls  it's  not  going  to   be  pretty.  And  looking  at  Bullmania   community  uh  during  the  last  24  hours   the  winners  are  still  the  bears.  If  I   look  who's  making  the  most  money  is   still  the  bears.  Here  someone  shorting   um  Axel.  Here  someone  shorting  ETH.  Here   someone  shorting  Soul.  using  the  money   line.  Fantastic.  Fant  fantastic.  Thank   you,  money  line.  Here,  someone  shorting   NYX.  And  here,  by  the  way,  someone   longing  a  single  long  from  Bruno.  Big   shout  to  to  Bruno  longing  pipin  with   20x,  but  with  mechanical  rules  with  stop   loss,  with  position  sizing.  It  makes   perfect  sense.  So,  what  we're  looking  at   right  now  is  basically  a  fork  in  the   road.  Bitcoin  currently  is  at  a  fork  in   the  road.  Are  we  going  to  go  down  into   buy  zone  or  not?  That's  what  Bitcoin  is   debating.  That's  the  really  the  the  real   fight  here  between  the  bulls  and  the   bears.  Long-term  long-term  we  are   accumulating  within  the  buy  zone.  But   for  short-term  trading,  you  could  make  a   trade  in  case  the  bounce  seems  um  seems   uh  real.  Let's  say  that  we  start  going   above  7374.   You  could  start  speculating  that  we're   going  to  break  this  resistance  that  we   currently  have  this  yellow  line  which  is   currently  resistance.  It  was  the   previous  year  low.  Should  we  break  it,   you  could  put  in  short-term  trades   towards  the  upside  and  take  profit   around  this  uh  level  right  here  at  um   86.  Could  absolutely  do  that.  This  is   very  important  to  realize  that  there  is   a  difference  between  being  bearish  on   the  mid  to  longer  term  basically  this   year  and  bullish  shortterm  should  we   bounce.  You  can  absolutely  combine  those   two  things.  And  so  looking  at  what  the   crypto  assets  have  been  doing,  you  can   go  to  scanner.bullmania.com  bulmania.com   if  you  have  bulmania  and  you  can  see   here  what  has  flipped  bullish  or  bearish   in  real  time  and  there  are  a  few  assets   that  do  quite  well  even  to  the  bullish   upside  in  the  last  month  if  they  are  in   a  bull  trend  on  the  daily  I'm  now   checking  some  of  the  bull  trends  that   have  happened  uh  during  the  last  uh  one   week  two  weeks  up  to  up  to  a  few  months   you  see  that  there  are  there  are  a  few   of  them  but  they  are  an  exception   basically  we  have  13%  bullish  coins   currently  and  87%  %  bearish.  Absolutely.   Absolutely  bearish.  And  looking  at  the   losses,  let  me  actually  see  here   something  I've  flipped  in  the  last,   let's  say,  three  weeks.  What  do  we  see?   If  I  look  one  second,  if  I  look  at  the   uh  current  situation  with  the  weekly   chart,  I  mean,  everything  is  quite  uh   quite  stagnant  now  in  the  in  the  bearish   direction.  Not  too  many  flips  recently   on  the  weekly.  Uh  on  the  uh  daily,  it's   a  it's  another  situation.  Uh  and  uh   looking  at  the  current  uh  current   charts,  this  is  the  this  is  the  this  the   raw  truth.  Bitcoin  down  a  lot  since  bare   flip.  Uh  Eve  down  a  lot  since  bare  flip.   Uh  XRP  down  a  lot  since  bare  flip.  And   this  is  the  kind  of  stuff  you  have  to   see  in  real  time.  So  something  that's   down  a  lot,  it's  uh  likely  to  continue   to  keep  continue  go  down  if  it  is  a  bare   trend.  So  guys,  trends  are  still  ruling   this  uh  market.  Absolutely.  Absolutely.   Absolutely.  the  trends  are  not  going   anywhere.  The  trends  are  still  here  and   they're  still  ruling  us  with  a  uh  with  a   with  a  fist  basically  with  a  with  an   iron  fist.  So  that's  that  in  terms  of  uh   the  overall  market.  I  want  to  welcome   everyone  who's  watching  live.  We  have  a   few  news  to  go  through  today.  Coinbase   is  leaving  optimism.  Basically  their  L2   they're  going  to  go  away  from  optimism.   I  also  want  to  give  a  big  shout  out  to   Guzman  who  is  timestamping  us  today.   Welcome  everyone.  And  as  always,  if  you   click  the  link  below  for  exchanges  I  use   uh  here,  exchanges  I  use,  you  see  it   right  below  this  video,  you  come  to  this   page  and  you  can  basically  sign  up  for   all  of  the  partner  exchanges,  get  a  big   fat  nice  sign  up  bonus  as  always  and  um   uh  go  long,  go  short.  Uh  you  can   speculate  on  all  of  these  different   scenarios  that  we  speak  about  on  buy   bit.  You  can  get  up  to  30K  in  welcome   rewards  based  on  the  deposit.  You  can   read  more  right  here  on  weeks.  On  weeks,   if  you  go  here  and  you  uh  go  to  weeks,   this  is  lower  KYC.  If  you  want  low  KYC,   then  go  to  weeks  and  you  can  go  long,   you  can  go  short  on  all  of  them.  U  also   you  get  fantastic  signups  around  30k   depending  on  the  deposit.  So  if  you   deposit,  the  more  you  deposit  the   better.  The  same  thing  with  bit  unix   also  low  KYC.  If  you want  local,  can  I   see  you  go  to  Bit  Unix  and  two  weeks  and   other  ones  as  well?  Uh,  welcome  guys.   Welcome,  welcome,  welcome.  I  see  the  uh   the  the  chat  someone  asking  end  of  layer   2.  It  is  kind  of  the  end  of  layer  2.   It's  been  kind  of  the  end  of  layer  2  for   quite  some  time.  My  guess  would  be  that   Coinbase  will  try  to  transition  more  and   more  towards  L1.  For  now  though,  they're   just  switching  from  the  OP  stack  to   their  own  stack.  They  say  that  they  want   to  do  ZK  proofs.  They  don't  want  to  rely   on  optimism  fully.  So  they  will  do  their   own  tech,  they  will  do  their  own  code   base  and  I  think  it's  a  question  of  time   before  they  do  L1.  Uh  technically  they   still  will  be  L2  technically  technically   but  um  uh  practically  they're  moving   more  towards  independence.  I  mean  there   is  really  no  need  for  them  to  to  be  on   L2.  It  is  just  um  complexity  and  um  uh   before  when  they  used  OP  stack  you  could   argue  that  okay  they  get  so  much  for   free  from  the  OP  stack  but  now  that  they   actually  invest  in  their  own  infra  in   their  own  knowhow  how  to  do  the  chain   how  to  do  the  sequencer  uh  all  of  the  uh   maintenance  they  will  have  to  do  to   their  own  codebase  they  are  taking  on   such  a  big  fat  challenge  with  all  of   this  with  moving  from  OP  which  means   that  for  them  it's  equally  good  to  BL1  I   mean  what's  the  point  if  they're  already   doing  so  work.  What's  the  point?  Just   BL1.  You  have  all  of  the  upside  done  and   you  don't  have  any  dependence  on  anyone   and  you  can  capture  all  of  the  revenues   and  you  can  still  have  a  bridge  to  ETH.   So  from  a  user  perspective,  you  can   still  capture  all  of  the  users  and  uh   that's  why  I  think  long-term  it's  um   it's  inevitable  that  they  will  move   towards  L1  especially  now  that  Vitalik   doesn't  even  want  L2s.  I  mean  that's   another  Vitalic  said  I  don't  want  L2.   Vitalic  wants  to  scale  L1.  So  per   Coinbase,  it's  inevitable  that  they're   also  going  to  be  L1  at  some  point.  Look   here,  there  is  a  lot  there  is  a  lot  a   lot  a  lot  a  lot  a  lot  of  liquidation   below  the  current  uh  uh  price.  So  if  we   look  at  the  liquidation  heat  map,  we   will  see  a  lot  of  liquidations  uh  below   us.  So  that's  another  reason  why  uh  from   a  market  maker  perspective,  from  a   liquidity  grab  perspective,  uh  it   wouldn't  surprise  me  if  we  actually   break  down  here  and  um  and  capture  the   the  liquidity  the  liquidity  at  around   yeah  uh  high  high  40s  low  50s  would  be   would  be  fantastic.  So  all  in  all  uh   path  of  least  resistance  down  and  this   is  something  for  us  to  keep  in  mind.   Now,  someone  asked,  I  just  saw  someone   in  the  chat  ask  about  the  Netherlands  uh   unrealized  gains  tax,  which  is  insane.   And  let  me  clarify  something  for  you   because  I  think  most  people  don't   understand  how  bad  it  is.  It  is  quite   bad.  This  this  tax  is  quite  bad,  but  I'm   not  sure  you  understand  how  bad  how  bad   it  is  because  we  kind  of  have  to  have  a   practical  example  here  to  understand  the   issue  with  a  36%  unrealized  gains  tax.   And  this  is  coming  in  to  many  countries.   is  not  only  Netherlands.  Now  Netherlands   is  the  first  to  implement  it.  But  you   understand  the  west  has  more  and  more   uh  socialism.  More  and  more  people  are   leaving  the  west.  So  they  have  to  tax   everyone  who  is  still  there.  In  Western   Europe,  it's  a  big  problem.  US,  if  you   have  Biden  back  and  Democrats  back,   they're  going  to  tax  as  well.  They   wanted  to  do  unrealized  gains  tax  in  the   past  term.  So  it's  it's  a  question  of   when,  not  not  if  for  most  Western   countries.  Let  me  just  illustrate  to  you   something.  So,  let's  say  that  you  start   with  $100.  Imagine  you  have  a  portfolio   of  $100  and  you  invest  in  Bitcoin.  You   invest  in  crypto.  You  you  do  good   trades.  You're  a  smart  person.  You  do   good  trades.  Maybe  you  have  Bulmania  to   to  pick  the  trades.  You  do  great.  So,   now  at  the  end  of  the  year,  you  have  uh   $200.  Okay?  Because  the  price  of  Bitcoin   has  doubled.  Let's  say  that  Bitcoin,   let's  just  say,  let's  imagine  for  a   second  that  Bitcoin  went  from  uh  50K  at   the  beginning  of  the  year  uh  to  100K,   okay?  50K  and  then  through  throughout   the  year  it  went  to  100K.  Here  is  the   evil  part,  guys.  Uh  look  here,  the   government  takes  now   um  $36  here  because  you  gained  a  100   bucks.  So,  they  take  $36.   So  you  you  are  now  no  longer  at  200.  You   are  now  here  at,  you  know,  100.  What  is   it?  Uh  $36.  You  you're  at  166.  They  they   they  stall  basically  30.  Uh  what  is  the   tax?  30  36,  right?  So  okay,  you're  at   164.  You're  at  164.  Okay.  But  Bitcoin  is   still  at  100K.  Okay.  You  understand?   What  happens  if  Bitcoin  goes  back  to   50K?  Just  back  to  where  it  started.  But   in  another  year,  you  are  not  going  to  be   break  even.  Bitcoin  is  going  to  be  break   even,  but  you  are  now  here  at  like  80   something  dollars.  Uh  you're  you're  now   at  80  82.  You  understand?  This  is  the   evil  part  where  they  gain  from  the   volatility  and  you  get  destroyed  if  your   asset  comes  back  to  break  even.  You   understand?  Will  will  it  be  possible  to   claim  some  of  these  losses  on  your  tax?   Who  the  hell  knows?  Likely  not.  I  mean   in  in  these  situations  with  claiming   loss  you  know  governments  don't  they   don't  allow  you  to  claim  the  loss  a  lot   even  if  you  can  claim  some  loss  is  like   partial  loss  okay  so  don't  get  surprised   if  uh  you're  you  will  not  be  allowed  to   claim  too  much  uh  if  anything  and  this   scenario  then  is  basically  you  holding   you  just  bought  bitcoin  at  50  it  went  to   100  then  came  back  to  50  but  for  you   you're  now  below  where  you  started  okay   it's  a  big  problem   oh  holy  crap  a  Guzzman  actually  confirms   that  unrealized  losses  are  not  allowed   with  the  new  law.  Oh  my  god.  So  you  can   actually  not  even  claim  the  loss  that   happened  later.  Holy.  And  Guzman  is  from   Netherlands,  so  he  he  probably  read  up   on  this.  So  guys,  you  understand?  Do  you   understand  the  evil  the  evil  part  here?   You  are  going  to  be  squeezed  and  milked   like  there's  no  tomorrow.  And  now  it  is   Netherlands.  If  you  are  in  Belgium,  you   may  be  thinking,  \"Haha,  I'm  in  Belgium.   I'm  I'm  okay,  guys.  It's  a  question  of   time.  Netherlands  or  Belgium  or  France   or  Germany  is  the  same  same  problems  is   the  same  thinking,  the  same  uh  people,   the  same  mindset,  the  same  political   leaning,  the  same  problems  with   immigration,  the  same  problems  with   public  budget.  There  is  no  difference.   They  are  the  same  political  entities   that  are  ruling  all  of  it.  It's  the  same   is  the  same.  It's  potato  potato  tomato   tomato.  Today  is  Netherlands.  tomorrow   is  Belgium  and  Germany  and  everyone  else   is  going  to  follow  very  quickly  and   that's  why  guys  you  really  have  to   consider  relocation  do  it  fast  because   yeah  I  mean  you  see  yourself  do  you  want   this  that's  I  mean  the  fact  that  this  is   even  legal  the  fact  that  this  is  not   breaking  some  constitution  is  crazy  it's   crazy  okay  and  this  can  happen  very   easily  I  mean  Bitcoin  can  double  and   then  go  back  easily  that's  exactly  what   what  it  did  recently  I  mean  it  went  from   I  mean  look  at   Look  at  actually  what  I  just  told  you   happened.  If  you  had  unrealized  gains   tax  in  20  um  I  mean  look  here  in  2024  it   went  uh  uh  uh  from  what  is  it  like  20  it   went  here  from  um  30k  this  is  beginning   of  let's  actually  measure  how  much  it   went  in  2024.  it  went  from  like  40k  in   2024  to   uh  around  100.  Okay,  so  here  you  would   already  lose  36%.  Now  the  problem  for   you  guys  is  also  that  uh  it  it  went  even   more  in  uh  2025.  So  you  lost  another  36%   of  this  gain  right  here.  And  now  it   backtracked  basically  all  of  the  gains.   So  you  pay  along  the  way  on  the  way  up   and  now  it  has  backtracked  basically  all   of  the  gains  and  if  we  get  this  flash   towards  uh  the  buy  zone  is  going  to  is   it  it  will  have  back  yeah  it  will  have   backtracked  everything.  So  you're  back   to  break  even  if  you're  if  if  you  are   holding  okay  and  uh  now  you  lost  36%  in   this  year  and  36%  in  the  next  year  on   the  gains.  So  yeah  it's  quite  crazy  guys   it's  quite  crazy.  It's  insane.  I  don't   know  what  to  say.  Uh  you  have  to  you   have  to  escape.  Now  let's  switch  gears  a   bit.  Let's  speak  about  micro  strategy.   People  ask,  \"Ivan,  why  are  you  not   heavily  into  micro  strategy,  guys?\"   Because  stuff  like  this  makes  me  a  bit   nervous.  Stuff  like  this  makes  me  a  bit   nervous.  He's  saying,  \"Stretch  your   income  to  11%.\"  Okay?  He  wants  to   stretch  my  income  to  11%.  Basically,   give  me  11%  free  money.  Listen  to  this.   >> When  your  dividend  is  at  zero,  this  is   like  a  normal  checking  account.  You   can't  hear  anything.  How  about  we  turn   it  up  to  3%.  Well,  this  is  like  a  money   market.  Pretty  boring  at  10%.  This  is   >> N  I  I  don't know  if  it's  copyright,  so  I   don't  so  I  don't  want  to  play,  but  you   you  you  get  the  point.  He  has  an  ad   where  he's  like,  \"Let  me  turn  turn  up   your  income.\"  3%,  7%,  11%.  Okay,  he's   going  to  give  you  11%.  And  uh  that's  why   uh  yeah,  personally,  I'm  not  a  big  fan.   Let's  see  what's  going  to  happen.  This   income  percent,  I  just  get  flashbacks,   guys.  I  I I  just  get  flashbacks  to  other   stuff.  So,  let's  see  what's  going  to   happen.  U  now  uh  Coinbase  leaving  OP   stack.  We  talked  about  that.  Um  not  good   for  OP  holders,  but  it  was  never  good   for  OP  holders.  And  if  you  followed  the   the  mechanical  rules,  you  follow  the   chart,  you  always  knew  that.  Uh  holding   OP  is  a  bad  bad  bad  thing.  OP  coin  is   very  very  very  very  very   bad  to  hold.  Uh  technically  they  have   good  fundamentals,  good  tech,  but  you   see  the  coin  is  down  and  down  and  down   and  down  and  today  it  went  down  another   10%  basically  having  heavy  price   discovery  of  alltime  lows.  It  had  it  was   already  discovering  alltime  lows  since   when?  Since  uh  October  and  now  it's  just   accelerating  down.  Guys,  this  is  the   problem  with  a  bare  trend.  Never  ever   ever  hodddle  bare  trend.  It's  very  very   very  bad.  Okay,  it's  extremely  bad.  So   be  careful  guys.  Be  careful.  I've  been   saying  that  it's  all  about  following  the   mechanical  rules,  knowing  when  they  turn   bearish  in  real  time,  such  as,  for   example,  like  I  showed  you  here  in  in   the  Bull  Mania  uh  terminal.  It's  very   important  to  know  when  things  go  against   you.  So,  you're  out  and  you're  out  fast.   Okay.  Um  yeah,  I  mean,  it  is  what  it  is.   And  now,  Coinbase  is  leaving.  So,  now   you  have  even  more  bad  news.  And  in  the   bare  trend,  bad  news  accelerate  you   down.  And  good  news  in  the  bare  trend   don't  accel  accelerate  you  up.  Uh  that's   that's  the  curse  of  the  bare  trend.  Um   let's  see.  Oh,  speaking  about   fundamentals,  let's  switch  gears  a  bit   to  a  bit  of  tech.  I  know  people  want  a   bit  of  tech.  Some  sometimes  people  say,   \"Ivan,  why  don't  you  speak  more  tech?  We   should  speak  more  tech.\"  Let's  speak  a   bit  about  tech.  So,  E  actually  has   something  very  interesting  here.  They're   adding  a  new  EIP  to  create  secret   addresses,  okay,  stealth  addresses  as   they  call  it,  so  that  when  you  receive  a   payment,  you  don't  have  to  dox  your   address  to  everyone  who  will  pay  you.  So   the  problem  first,  every  time  someone   sends  you  ETH  or  tokens,  your  wallet   address  is  exposed  publicly.  Anyone  can   look  at  your  address  and  see  every   single  thing  you've  ever  received.  And   that's  not  great.  The  intuition  behind   stealth  addresses  is  the  following.   Imagine  you  give  someone  a  formula   instead  of  your  address.  They  use  that   formula  to  generate  a  brand  new  one-time   address  just  for  you.  Only  you  can   figure  out  it  belongs  to  you.  So   everyone  else  is  just  a  random  wallet.   That's  a  core  idea  how  it  actually   works.  You  publish  two  public  keys,  a   spending  key  and  a  viewing  key.  The   sender  generates  a  random  e  ephemereral   key,  computes  a  shared  secret  using  your   viewing  key,  hashes  it,  and  derives  a   fresh  stealth  address  from  your  spending   key  plus  that  hash.  Oh,  here's  the   elegant  part.  The  math  is  based  on  ETH   cryptography,  the  same  the  same   cryptographic  function.  And  how  do  you   find  payments  routed  to  you?  there's  a   system  to  get  you  notified  and  so  on  and   so  forth.  So  let's  see  how  that's  going   to  be  implemented.  ETH  is  the  best  at   doing  EIPs  and  kind  of  bad  at  the   rolling  stuff  out.  So  there  are  many   EIPs  that  are  passed  um  all  the  time.  Uh   for  example,  a  good  example  is  this  um   account  abstraction.  Still  most  wallets   don't  support  it.  Most  wallets  still   don't  have  this,  you  know,  automations   and  a  nice  account  abstraction.  So  it   takes  maybe  like  five  years  for  the  for   the  average  good  upgrade  to  be   integrated  in  all  wallets.  And  I   understand  the  complexity.  I  understand   that  wallets  cannot  move  fast.  MetaMask,   for example,  for  them  to  move  fast  is   impossible.  They  are  so  security  aware.   They  want  to  ensure  that  they  don't  mess   anything  up.  So,  it  takes  time.  But   stuff  like  this  is  nice  on  paper.  In   practice,  this  probably  is  going  to  take   uh  yeah,  I  don't  know,  five  years,  maybe   more  to  get  to  get  integrated   everywhere.  E  is  not  the  fastest  at   integration.  And  um  that's  pro  and  con.   So,  yeah,  let's  see.  But  overall,  I  love   that  we're  going  to  have  more  anonymity,   more  privacy  solution  for  ETH.  It's   very,  very  good,  especially  in  this   current  time.  Look  here,  Germany's   counselor  wants  to  ban  online  anonymity.   He  says,  \"I  want  real  names.\"  And  to  me,   this  sounds  like  this  pap,   you  know  guys,  he  wants  your  pap.  Okay?   He  wants  your  pap.  And  he  needs  to  know   who  the  hell  you  are.  You  need  to   identify  yourself  as  soon  as  possible.   Otherwise,  he's  not  going  to  be  happy.   He's  not  going  to  be  happy.  And   meanwhile,  Macron  said  that  free  speech   is  [ __ ]  Okay?  And  Macaron  came  out   and  said  that  he  doesn't  like  free   speech.  It's  [ __ ]  because  we  need  to   regulate  it  and  uh  all  of  that.  Listen   to  this  uh  here.   Because  I  mean  free  speech  is  a  pure   [ __ ]  if  nobody  knows  how  you  are   guided  through  this  so-called  free   speech  especially  when  it's  to  be  guided   from  one  hated  speech  to  another  hated   speech.   I  I  just  want  to  have  a  transparent   road  through  these  different  speeches   and  I  want  by  the  way  to  have  a  sort  of   public  order.  I  I  I  want  to  avoid  racist   speech,  hated  speech  and  so  this  my  and   the  third  one.   Oh  yeah,  let's  see.  Yes,  he  wants  free   speech  but  it's  a  lot  of  roadblock.  He's   a  lot  a  lot  of  roadblock.  And  by  the   way,  the  United  States  I  I  agree  what   with  president  saying  here.  The  United   States  actually  has  remarkably   consistent  legal  doctrine  on  this  point.   European  politicians  choose  to  ignore   this  because  they  operate  fairly   extensive  censorship  regimes  that  would   be  incompatible  with  actual  free  speech.   100%.  I  can  tell  you  that  when  it  comes   to  free  speech,  the  US  is  the  gold   standard  and  the  the  European  countries   sadly  they  don't  really  have  free  speech   in  the  in  the  real  sense.  I  mean  they   have  a  law.  What  do  they  have?  They  have   some  kind  of  law  that  says  that  they're   supposed  to  have  free  speech.  That's  why   Stormer  and  Macaron  if  you  ask  them   they're  going  to  say  I  mean  we  have   technically  free  speech  but  practically   there  are  so  many  problems  with  it.   There  are  oh  you  can  say  this  but  not   this.  Oh,  but  this  now  it's  these  guys   now  are  upset  and   the  the  corridor  is  shrinking  year  by   year  by  year.  So  that's  very  important   to  realize  that  on  a  values  um  spectrum   the  US  and  European  countries  and   constitutions  are  very  different.   They're  extremely  extremely  different.   And  the  US  when  it  comes  to  free  speech   it  they  have  proven  over  and  over  again   that  it's  way  harder  to  to  come  in  and   mess  with  it.  Way  way  harder.  Is  it   impossible?  Well,  it's  not  impossible   because  even  Biden  could  do  it.  And  you   know  the  Twitter  files,  all  of  the   problems  that  Twitter  had  to  deal  with.   This  was  before  Elon  and  they  complied   with  most  of  the  government  requests  to   censor  and  so  forth.  So  it  was   definitely  possible,  but  you  see  how   fast  it  snapped.  It  also  snapped  back   fast.  In  Europe,  man,  the  population  is   too  brainwashed.  They  actually  love  the   censorship.  They  love  it.  They  love  it.   They  love  to  be  super  safe,  super   censored.  That's  exactly  that's  exactly   in  the  in  the  public  conscious.  Okay.   Um,  so  yeah,  that's  that  guys.  Let's  go   to  Q&A.  Just  want  to  share  a  message   here  from  Gio  from  our  Discord.  He   shared  something  very  very  interesting   to  give  a  different  perspective  and   please  don't  take  this  as  a  brag.  Since   I  joined  Bulmania  at  the  start  of   December,  I've  been  quite  okay  in  terms   of  trading  almost  plus  7R.  And  for  all   of  you  guys  who  are  not  in  Bulman,  you   probably  don't  know  what  R  is,  but   basically  it  is  risk  unit.  you  risk   something  and  when  you  risk  you  want  to   of  course  get  more  than  you  risk.  So   when  someone  joins  Bulmania  the  first   thing  we  teach  them  is  position  sizing,   risk  management  and  um  how  to  do  trades   properly.  So  you  have  infinite  upside   but  very  limited  downside  and  as  part  of   that  you  need  to  know  what  is  your  R  and   your  R  is  your  risk.  So  you  define  your   risk  first  then  you  set  stop  loss  based   on  volatility  then  you  calculate   position  size.  So  we  always  measure  the   performance  not  in  dollars  not  in   percent  although  percent  are  big  as  well   I  mean  I  share  with  you  every  day  with   all  of  this  percent  but  at  the  core  you   need  to  measure  your  performance  in  R   how  much  you  risk  versus  how  much  you   pull  out  of  the  market  measured  in  how   much  you  risk  okay  so  he  says  I  can't   say  exactly  what  the  reason  is  uh  could   also  be  pure  luck  I  tried  to  keep   trading  only  top  100  coins  never  went   into  the  [ __ ]  all  trades  were   mechanical  and  by  the  book  always  1.5x   ATR  again  all  of  you  who  If you're  not   in  Bullmania,  you  don't  know  this  simple   concept,  but  this  is  a  measure  of   volatility  that  we  use  to  to  set  the   stop  loss.  Max  2%  risk  and  max  2x   average.  I  try  to  focus  on  protecting   capital  as  much  as  possible  and  making   an  honest  back  here  and  there.  It  ain't   much,  but  it's  honest  work.  Of  course,   it  is  not  that  much  in  terms  of  grand   scheme  of  things,  but  that's  the  that's   the  most  important  thing  when  you  are   new.  When  you're  new,  your  job  is  to   grow  the  RS  that  you  is  is  to  harvest   the  RS.  you  risk  one  R,  you  should  get   more  than  one  R.  So  that's  that.  I  think   that  managing  emotions  is  a  big  part   100%.  Big  shout  out  to  J.  Thanks  a  lot   for  sharing.  That's  very  important   because  as  as  soon  as  you  manage  your   RS,  you  risk  one  R,  let's  say  you  risk   1%  of  the  portfolio,  but  you  can   consistently  pull  out  uh  two  Rs,  in  this   case  2%.  Um  or  one  even  1.5  R  and  you   can  consistently  repeat  it,  then  it's   just  a  matter  of  scaling  the  the  bets.   It's  just  a  matter  of  scaling  the  the   trades  as  as  as  soon  as  you  understand   that  and  you  have  confidence  in   yourself.  You  can  pull  out  more  than  you   risk  then  you  know  sky  is  the  limit.  So   if  you  want  to  learn  go  to  bullmania.com   sign  up  for  the  free  training  that's  the   first  step  you  get  the  money  line  of   course  you  get  the  money  scanner  so  you   see  when  things  are  flipping  in  real   time  so  you  don't  get  wrecked  holding   some  uh  some  fugazi  or  if  you  hold   something  is  good  is  in  a  bullish  trend   like  rain  since  two  months  ago  151%  in  a   bull  trend  that's  very  very  very  nice.   So  guys,  on  this  note,  let's  go  to  Q&A.   And  for  all  you  guys  in  the  Netherlands   or  in  the  countries  kind  of  like   Netherlands,  uh  you  got  to  be  careful,   man.  You  got  to  be  careful  because  uh   the  unrealized  gains  act,  it  is  coming.   Even  if  you  are  in  the  US,  you  need  to   understand  that  if  we  have  the  Democrats   come  back,  it's  not  going  to  be  great.   And  yes,  Trump  is  doing  all  kinds  of   crazy  things,  which  sadly,  I  mean,  this   is  the  problem.  Sadly,  I  think  it's   going  to  make  the  pendulum  swing  back.   Sad.  I  mean  this  is  the  sad  reality   guys.  If  Trump  would  just  focus  on  the   core  which  is  you  know  crypto  pro   business  uh  against  wars  which  was  the   whole  idea  if  he  would  just  focus  on   that  and  really  show  a  great  track   record  on  these  core  things  man  it  would   be  amazing  but  he  he  he's  gone  loco  HE'S   GONE  LIKE  WAY  WAY  TAKING  over  Greenland   and  everything  that  the  the  pendulum  I   think  is  going  to  swing  back  and  I  mean   it's  going  to  be  bad  guys  we're  going  to   be  back  kind  of  to  this  uh  we're  going   to  be  back  kind  of  to  this  uh  lady  right   here,   >> the  more  perfect  union  and  we  fought  a   civil  war  over  part  of  it   >> and  people  have  been  protesting  you  know   for  hundreds  of  years  uh  that  you  know   things  were  not  as  they  should  be  given   our  ideals  and  how  we  should  be  uh  uh   moving  toward  them.  So,  I  think  that's   what  makes  us  so  special  as  a  country.   And  the  idea  that  you  could  turn  the   clock  back  and  try  to  recreate  a  world   that  never  was  dominated  by,  you  know,   let's  say  it,  white  men,  uh,  of  a   certain  persuasion,  uh,  a  certain   religion,  uh,  a  certain  point  of  view,  a   certain,   >> this  is  like,  you  know,  a  mummy  from,   uh,  2015  or  something.  2015  like  I  I  to   be  to  be  fair  I  feel  a  bit  triggered   like  what  does  she  mean?  I  mean  I'm  a   man.  I'm  straight.  I'm  white.  I'm   Christian.   >> Persuasion  uh  a  certain  religion  uh  of  a   certain   >> uh  what  what  does  she  mean?   >> I  you  know  let's  say  it.  White  men   >> let's  say  it  what  do  you  mean?  Say  that   you're  a  freaking  racist.  What  do  you   mean?  Say  it  loud.  Hillary.  Are  you   racist  or  what  the  hell?  Don't  be   ashamed.  Look  here.   >> You  know  let's  say  it.  white  men  uh  of  a   certain  persu   >> Which  certain  which  certain  say  it  exact   say  exact  that  you  don't  like  dudes  like   me  say  it  ex  why  she's  not  exact  say  it   exact  don't  be  ashamed  see  this  is  the   problem  we're  going  to  have  this  back  uh   with  a  with  a  pendulum  swing  and  with   that  you  know  it's  a  package  guys  this   this  is  a  whole  package  it's  going  to   come  with  what  with  uh  higher  tax   because  uh  yeah  I  mean  the  white  dudes   got  to  pay  We're  going  to  pay  bigly   bigly  bigly  and  a  certain  religion  uh  a   certain  point  of  view  a  certain  ideology   it's  just   >> say  it  anyway.  So  why  am  I  saying  this?   You  need  to  be  careful  even  in  the  US   guys  you  have  to  be  careful  because  the   unrealized  gains  what  we've  been  saying   it's  um  is  coming  like  with  this  kind  of   lazy  is  going  to  come  easy  easy  and  I   understand  you  know  Trump  people  don't   like  Trump  even  people  who  like  Trump   before  now  with  you  know  all  of  the   chaos  and  all  of  that  but  sadly  I  mean   these  are  the  two  choices  I  mean  that   that's  what  it  is  that's  what  it  is  I   also  wish  that  Trump  would  just  focus  on   the  core  which  is  crypto  pro  business   low  tax  uh  control  the  border  it  would   be  fantastic  if  we  just  focus  on  that.   But  no,  no,  you  have  to  go,  you  know,   bigly  bigly.  Yeah.  Amen.  So,  let's  go  to   Q&A  to  questions  and  answers  and   debates.  Let's  go   down   analyzing  coins.  Whatever  you  want,  we   could  do  it.   Z  will  capture.  Exactly.  Exactly.   Exactly.   Bill  Clinton  had  it  better  with  money.   Yeah,  let's  let's  not  get  too  deep  into   that.   Uh,  no  sides  in  crypto,  Michael.  Uh,   questions  answer  debates.  Exactly.   You're  forgetting  that  you  have  to  have   the  money  to  pay  the  tax.  Oh,  by  the   way,  this  is  another  thing  to  question   to  Guzman.  Question  to  Guzman.  Thinking   back  to  our  uh  to  our  example  here,   here's  the  problem.  Do  you  have  to  pay   realized  gain  gains  tax  to  pay  the   unrealized  gains  tax?  Because  this  is   something  that's  not  part  of  this   calculation.  Let's  say  that  Bitcoin  does   double.  You  know,  first  it  doubles.  It   goes  from  50  to  100.  You  go  from  $100  to   200.  You  are  you  owe  here  unrealized   gain  tax,  but  to  get  the  money  for  it,   you  need  to  sell  the  asset.  Like  where   do  you  get  the  36  bucks  from?  You   actually  have  to  sell  here.  Okay.  And  if   you  sell  to  get  the  36  bucks,  do  you   have  to  pay  tax  on  this  realized  gain?   Because  then  if  you  have  to  pay  tax  on   the  realized  I  mean  let's  say  that  it's   another  third.  So  it's  what  is  it  like   let's  say  it's  12  more  dollars  in   realized  gain  tax.  So  then  it's  not  then   you're  not  back  at  164.  You're  back  at   152  potentially  if  you  also  have  to  pay   the  realized  gain.  Okay.  So  just  a   question  here  because  that's  how  I'm   mentioning  is  that  that's  how  in  Norway   for  example  the  wealth  tax  works  in   Norway  that  uh  you  have  the  wealth  tax   but  to  pay  it  you  have  to  sell  and  then   you  also  then  you  have  to  pay  the   realized  gains.  So  wealth  tax  is  just   they  have  like  what  is  it  like  1%  or  how   much  it  is  but  okay  where  do  you  get  the   money?  If  you  have  all  money  in  the   assets  you  have  to  sell  what  happens  it   becomes  realized  and  then  you  have  to   pay  unrealized.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.   Man,  guys,  we  cannot  have  Hillary.   It's  going  to  be  very  bad.  It's  going  to   be  back  to  2015.  Okay,   but  it's  a  it's  a  pendulum,  guys.  It's  a   pendulum.  It  goes  back  and  forth.  We  had   too  much  of  the  lefty  stuff.  It  went  too   much  into  the  Trump  stuff.   If  we  just  find  the  nice  somewhere  in   the  middle,  but  that's  not  how  it  works.   That's  That's  not  how  America  works.  Is   It  cannot  be  moderate.  It  needs  to  be   crazy  one  way  or  another.   1.1  tax  on  my  net  worth  each  year.  Lol.   You're  in  Norway.  Is  it  1.1%?  Holy  cra.   the  I  mean  you  if  you  are  in  a  country   with  some  kind  of  wealth  tax  or   unrealized  gains  tax  you  have  to  see  the   go  to  chat  GPT  or  claude  and  ask  it  to   model  to  draw  a  chart  of  how  your   portfolio  would  be  growing  with  and   without  the  wealth  tax  it's  going  to  be   crazy  revelation  too  um  and  also  with   and  without  the  unrealized  gains  tax   because  you  see  it  kills  the  performance   a  lot  versus  if  you  have  no  unrealized   GS  and  no  wealth  tax   I  mean  why  not  short  all  L2  starting   with  orbitum?  Absolutely.  I  mean  it's   they  are  in  bare  trend  and  bare  trend   means  shortable.  Absolutely.  Um   you  can  absolutely  short  it  as  long  as   it's  bare  trend.  Absolutely.  I  mean  you   see  yourself  it's  lower  and  lower  and   lower  and  lower  you  and  now  kind  of   trying  to  do  a  bottom.  I  would  say  if  it   starts  breaking  this  and  now  it  has  like   the  last  support  here.  Maybe  maybe  it's   going  to  get  a  bounce  here,  but  probably   not.  Okay.  Oh,  guys,  by  the  way,  you  you   remember  back  in  October,  we  said  to  be   careful  risk  off  when  a  lot  of  coins  had   this  flash  crash.  Well,  now  they  kind  of   also  stepped  down.  Uh  this  was  like   crazy,  you  know.  Oh  my  god.  Orbitum  went   from  0.3  to  0.1.  Cra,  how  can  it  happen?   So  crazy.  And  now  actually  we  also  went   went  to  it  properly  properly  candle  by   candle  week  by  week  with  confidence   steps  it  went  down.  So  guys,  something   that's  in  a  bare  trend  is  absolutely   shortable.  The  bigger  question  is   whether  it's  the  best  opportunity  or  not   and  that's  where  you  can  make  the   argument  that  it's  better  to  short   something  that's  in  a  new  bare  trend.  So   that's  why  you  have  the  money  scanner   that  tells  you  when  things  flip  bullish   in  real  time.  So  it's  more  it's  not   whether  it's  good  or  bad.  I  would  say  it   is  a  solid  short.  If  you  have  the   mechanical  rules,  you  you  can  set  stop   loss,  you  know  your  risk  and  all  of   that.  It's  solid.  But  is  it  the  best?   That's  where  you  you  would  prefer  uh  if   you  have  to  choose  you  would  prefer  to   be  in  a  new  new  B  trend.   Uh  when  do  you  think  Clarity  Act  will   pass?  Will  Coinbase  get  their  way?  I   don't  know  guys.  It's  more  of  a  it's   more  of  a  technical  question  how  this   law  proceedings  work.  My  understanding   now  is  going  to  be  quite  tough  because   it's  going  to  get  into  the  midterms  and   campaigning  and  all  of  the  politicians   need  to  campaign.  I  I  don't  know.  Uh  I   also  don't  really  care.  I  don't  think   it's  going  to  help  a  lot  because  it's  um   um  it's  not  too  like  it's  not  super   good.  It's  not  super  bad.  It's  a  bit  of   me.  I  don't  I  don't  follow  it.  I  I  don't   know.  I  don't  not  It  will  not  pump   anything.  Okay.  If  you  think  that   Clarity  Act  is  going  to  pump  the  bag,   it's  not  going  to  pump  the  bag.  Uh  I  see   some  people  confused.  They  think  that   this  law  is  going  to  save  them.  It's  not   going  to  save  anyone.   So,  don't  worry.  Don't  um  yeah,  don't  um   I  I  would  I  wouldn't  even  follow  it.   We're  gonna  see  it  in  in  the  news  and  we   we're  gonna  mention  it  for  10  seconds   and  then  everyone's  gonna  forget  it.   I  think  in  the  Netherlands  we  will  get  a   lot  of  losses  against  the  government  for   stealing  and  breaking  European  laws  just   like  past  situations  with  tax  on  savings   happened.  Okay.   Is  there  some  European  rules  not   allowing   uh  not  allowing  uh  tax?  I  think  in   Europe  they  love  tax.  I  I  think  they  you   you  sure  you  sure  that  you  you  can  be   saved  by  European  rules?   Maybe  maybe  there  is  something  but  uh   they  will  find  a  way.  They  will  find  a   way.  Don't  I  don't  doubt  when  it  comes   to  taxing.  They  will  find  a  way  for   sure.  For  sure.  So  yeah,  don't  bet  on   that.  You  you  have  to  Yeah,  you  have  to   relocate.  It's  simple.  Did  you  read  that   Ran  banter  liquidated  all  his  crypto?  He   said  so  on  X.  Yeah,  I  saw  that  he  he  had   this,  you  know,  I  lost  belief  in  Bitcoin   this  and  that.  But  it's  a  big  shout  out   to  Ran,  but  overall  I  think  it's  the   sentiment  of  the  buy  zone.  Okay.  Um  I   haven't  seen  him  be  bearish  in  October   like  we  were  uh  and  you  can  see  it  in   the  track  record  here.  Boom.com/ivan   what  we  said  back  in  October.  I  haven't   seen  him  be  bearish  here.  I  mean  the   time  to  be  bearish  was  here,  you  know,   the  the  time  to  be  disappointed  and   stuff.  it  was  here.  Now,  it's  more  of  a   time  to  be  excited.  It's  more  of  a  time   to  uh  see  still  see  the  downside.  I   think  we  can  easily  go  to  40  still,  but   you  know,  we're  we're  starting  to  get   into  the  neighborhood  of  uh  fantastic   prices.  Fantastic.  And  this  bare  flip  uh   flip  from  bear  to  bull  is  going  to  come   down  very  quickly  also.  So  I  think  that   it's  just  very  common  to  see  such   statements  around  the  buy  zone  but  buy   zone  can  still  can  sing  it  for  six   months.  Okay,  we  can  still  go  lower  but   it's  good.  I  I  think  overall  it's  good   um  it's  it's  good  to  see  change  in   sentiment.  We  need  the  sentiment   crashed.  I  want  all  bullish  sentiment   destroyed.  Everyone  who  hopes  for  a   V-shaped  recovery  has  some  kind  of   business  cycle  praying  for  the  business   cycle.  Their  portfolios  need  to  be   obliterated.  They  have  to  be  stopped   out.  They  have  to  be  destroyed  when  it   comes  to  their  crypto  journey.  And  I'm   saying  that  as  a  professional,  as  a   human  being,  obviously  I'm   compassionate.  I  feel  for  everyone  at  a   loss.  Like  as  a  human  being,  I'm   compassionate.  But  as  a  professional,  I   have  to  tell  you  that  the  best  thing  we   can  hope  for  like  the  best  bottom  would   be  crushing  everyone  max  pain.  Everyone   who  did  not  listen  listen  to  the  trend.   Everyone  who  did  not  understand  that  the   tides  are  shifting.  They  need  to  be   destroyed  and  obliterated.  That's  when   the  bottom  can  happen  as  a  person.  I   love  I  love  everyone.  I  I'm   compassionist  max  compassion  uh  max   compassion  mode.  But  uh  as  professional   and  I  want  to  keep  it  professional  to   you  guys.  Normally  you  need  the   sentiment  crushed  and  it's  funny  because   the  guys  you  remember  in  October  we   became  bearish.  Okay.  And  people  said,   \"Oh,  Ivan  is  bearish.  It  means  that  the   bottom  is  in.\"  Like  they  said  so  at  110.   Oh,  Ivan  bearish.  The  bottom  is  in.  Man,   what  are  you  speaking?   Oh,  Ivan  is  bearish.  The  bottom  is  in.   It  was  95K.  They  said  the  bottom  is  in.   Oh,  Ivan  so  bearish.  90K.  The  bottom  is   Man,  what  speak  in  reality?  It  is  when   these  guys  like  bottom  is  in,  guys.  When   they  become  bearish,  that's  when  the   bottom  is  in.  Okay.  Okay.  So,  I  need  all   of  them,  all  of  the  hopeful,  you  know,   cheerful  traders  living  in  La La L  or  I   mean  again,  they  they  live  in  agony.   They  don't  live  in  La La Land,  but  they   try  to  attract  La  La Land.  They  they   they  think  that  the  market  work  in  a  way   where  they  huddle.  The  more  they  huddle,   the  more  they  are  deserving  of  recovery.   It  doesn't  work  like  that.  And  so  on  so   forth.  So  that's  why  professionally  I  I   actually  like  seeing  people  give  up  hope   on  crypto.  We  know  crypto  is  not  going   to  go  anyway.  We  know  that  Bitcoin  is   not  going  to  go  anyway.  I'm  a  strong   believer  in  crypto,  in  Bitcoin,  in   privacy  coins  and  so  on.  Uh  especially   when  you  see  uh  you  know  grandmas  like   this  coming  after  us  in  particular.   Okay.  Uh  certain  religion,  certain  skin   color.  I  I  don't  know  why  is  why  is  it   okay  for  her  to  speak  about  skin  color   and  religion?  Okay.  It's  a  bit  of  hate   speech.  I  mean  to  be  fair  I  I  would   classify  that  as  a  bit  of  hate  speech.   Uh  why  is  it  okay  for  her  to  speak  about   uh  uh  skin  color  and  gender  and  uh  and   religion?  I  mean  it's  kind  of  attacking   the  core  of  uh  who  someone  is.  Okay.   Now,  uh  I  I  don't  mean  to  be  like  too   emotional  here,  but  it's  isn't  it  crazy?   Like  wh  why  why  is  she  allowed  on  TV  say   like  that?  So  crypto  is  important   because  you  can  actually  remove  yourself   from  this  mental  mental  hospital  that  uh   potentially  is  going  to  move  back  into   the  White  House.  I  mean  it's  a  bit  of   mental  hospital  now  also  but  you   understand  it's  it's  a  distance  between   you  and  whatever  is  happening  there  up   top.  Okay.  So  that's  why  I  think  that   crypto  is  not  going  to  go  anyway.  I  mean   you  just  see  Bitcoin  promotion  every   day.  I  mean  the  you  see  her  she's   promoting  Bitcoin  every  day.  Um  and  uh   we  are  close  to  fantastic  buy   opportunities.  So  to  answer  your   question  Guzman  it's  very  expected  that   people  are  like  that  around  the  buy  zone   very  expected  and  I  expect  more  of  them   uh  to  be  like  that.  Okay  fantastic.  So   uh  it's  it's  according  to  plan  uh  maybe   even  exactly  exactly  as  predicted.   Ian,  I  don't  feel  the  sentiment  is   crushed.  Do  you?  Uh,  I  don't  think  it's   fully  crushed.  I  think  we're  getting  I   mean,  we're  getting  quite  close.  It's  I   don't  I  don't  get  as  much  push  back  now   when  it  comes  to  the  uh  the  um  my  views.   I  don't  get  that  much  push  back.  In   October,  I  got  a  lot  a  lot  a  lot.  I  got   a  lot.  Now,  I  mean,  I  actually  get  a  lot   of  recognition  now.  So,  I  feel  that  it   is  definitely  changing  towards  the  bear.   Uh  and  but  it's  not  it's  not  fully  dead.   Uh  but  it's  getting  close,  guys.  It's   getting  close  within  the  coming  months.   I  think  we're  going  to  be  there.  And   time  flies.  I  mean,  it's  already  March   soon.  It  was  December  just  recently.  Now   already  March.  So,  let's  say  a  few  more   months.  June.  Maybe  it's  already  in  the   in  the  in  the  bottoming  bottom  creation.   Let's  see.   Did  you  say  Bullmania  includes  some  sort   of  report  outlook  on  potential  coins?   Yeah.  So,  every  week  I  write  a  report   for  Bullmania  analyzing  the  market.  Um,   in  bull  market  we  include  new  coins  for   sure.  Now  in  bare  we  look  at  the   existing  positions  and  have  more  of  a   big  picture  because  obviously  in  the  in   the  bare  there  are  not  not  a  lot  of  new   coins  but  there  are  opportunities  to   short  stuff  uh  there  are  opportunities   to  accumulate  cheaply  but  there  are  no   new  coins  now  in  the  same  way  as  it  is   in  bull.  So  depending  on  the  market   condition  we  bring  the  the  best  possible   uh  read  on  the  market.  So  uh  that's  how   you  know  most  of  our  community  who's   been  reading  my  reports  weekly  they  I   mean  since  uh  you  know  my  reports  are   between  20  and  30  pages  each  and  every   week  each  and  every  week.  So  uh  everyone   who  read  them  who  really  understood  them   we've  been  guising  by  the  hand  by  the   hand  week  by  week  by  week  by  week  what's   been  happening  and  I'm  sharing  also  what   I'm  doing  with  my  with  my  portfolio.   for  that  go  to  bullmania.com  and  watch   the  free  trading  very  important  I  mean   literally  it's   I  don't  know  how  many  like  millions  and   hundreds  of  millions  we  saved  in  user   portfolio  but  probably  it  is  in  the   hundreds  of  millions  I'm  not  kidding  in   the  hundreds  of  millions  probably  we   saved   wifey  not  on  board  you  mean  your  wifey   doesn't  allow  you  to  join  Bulmania  okay   Uh   oh.  Guzman  says  Prince  Andrew  has  been   arrested.   What  happened?  He's  in  the  files.   Huh?  There  you  go.  What's  going  on,   guys?  He's  in  the  files  or  what   happened?

So,  I'm  not  um  but  at  the   same  time  also,  yeah,  it's  uh  you  you   got  to  make  the  move.  You  got  to  make   the  move.

Uh  by  the  way,  I  did  not  say  wife  wear   the  pants.  It  was  big  papa  in  the  chat.   But  I  I  was  kind  of  thinking  that,  but  I   thought  let  me  be  a  bit  uh  politically   correct.  As  you  know,  we're  probably  you   know  the  most  humble  channel.  So  I   thought  let  me  not  say  it  but  as  big   papa  1858  said  that  wife  is  wearing  the   pants.  I  I  can  just  agree.   I  can  just  agree   guys.

    "summary_hu": "A Bitcoin piaci helyzete kritikus szakaszba lépett, hiszen az 66-67 ezer dolláros szinten mozog, és a 200 hetes mozgóátlag kapuja csupán 57 ezer dollárnál található. Amennyiben a 66-67 ezer dolláros támogatás megszűnik, a következő célpont 40 ezer dollár lehet, ami komoly eladási nyomást eredményezhet. A hosszú távú kilátások bearish irányba hajlanak, míg a rövid távú ügyletkor, ha a Bitcoin 73-74 ezer dollár fölé emelkedik, a kereskedők spekulálhatnak gyors nyereségre. A piacon a bikák gyengélkednek, a medvék dominálnak, ami azt jelzi, hogy a hangulat továbbra is pesszimista. A Coinbase L2-ről való távozása is aggasztó nyitány a piaci hírek között, amely tovább erősíti a bearish trendet. Az uniós országok, különösen a Hollandia által bevezetett unrealizált nyereségadó pedig újabb problémákat vet fel a kereskedők számára.",
    "summary_en": "Bitcoin is currently at a critical juncture, trading around $66-67k, while the 200-week moving average sits at approximately $57k. If the crucial support at $66-67k breaks, the next target could be the $40k level, leading to significant selling pressure. Long-term outlook remains bearish, but short-term trades could be viable if Bitcoin manages to rise above $73-74k. The market sentiment is currently driven by bears, indicating a pessimistic outlook for bulls. Additionally, Coinbase's departure from L2 is a concerning development in market news, reinforcing the bearish trend. The unrealized gains tax introduced in the Netherlands also presents new challenges for traders, suggesting that market dynamics could worsen further.",
