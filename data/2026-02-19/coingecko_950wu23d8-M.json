    "transcript": "2025  has  shaped  up  to  be  a  massive  year   for  crypto.  And  like  every  cycle,  we've   watched  trends  rise,  hype  fade,  and   entirely  new  narratives  take  the  [music]   spotlight.  Stable  coins  became  a  major   pillar,  prediction  markets  took  off,  and   we  finally  saw  meaningful  steps  toward   regulation  and  institutional   involvement.  So  with  all  that  momentum,   the  big  question  now  is  what  will   [music]  crypto  look  like  in  2026?   To  get  a  clearer  picture,  let's  look  at   a  new  writeup  from  Coinbase  Ventures,   the  corporate  venture  arm  of  Coinbase   that  invests  in  early  stage  crypto   startups.  According  to  their  team,  the   underlying  infrastructure  for  crypto  has   quietly  leveled  up  over  the  past  year.   Stable  coin  rails  are  reshaping  how   payments  move.  Crosschain  proofs  are   shrinking  settlement  times  from  days  to   near  instant.  And  even  if  prices  don't   always  reflect  it,  liquidity  is   improving,  privacy  tools  are  getting   smarter,  and  blockchains  are  learning  to   communicate  far  more  reliably.  From  all   this,  they've  identified  nine  big  ideas   that  they  think  will  shape  2026  and   organize  them  into  four  key  themes.  So,   let's  break  them  down.  The  first  idea  is   the  rise  of  realworld  asset  perpetuals.   A  perpetual  future  or  perp  is  basically   a  way  to  speculate  on  an  asset's  price   without  actually  owning  it.  It  tracks   the  price  in  real  time  and  you  can  go   long  or  short  instantly.  And  now  imagine   doing  that  for  real  world  assets  like   stocks,  commodities,  and  even  economic   data  all  without  needing  to  tokenize   anything.  Now,  tokenization  sounds  great   in  theory,  but  in  practice,  it  can  be   slow,  legal  heavy,  and  often  just  not   possible.  Perpetuals  bypass  all  of  that   by  creating  a  synthetic  version  of  the   asset.  Coinbase  Ventures  thinks  this   could  open  up  two  huge  paths.  Firstly,   the  ability  to  create  markets  around   almost  anything  like  private  company   valuations,  economic  indicators,  and   niche  data  sets.  things  that  normally   have  zero  liquidity  could  suddenly  have   [music]  tradable  markets.  Second,  it   gives  crypto  traders  access  to  classic   macro  exposure.  Onchain  markets  tied  to   things  like  oil  prices,  inflation   expectations,  credit  spreads,  and   volatility.  In  other  words,  access  to   the  kinds  of  tools  professional  macro   traders  use,  but  fully  on  chain.  So  they   call  this  shift  the  purpification  of   everything  and  expected  to  be  a  major   trend  heading  into  2026.  Next  up  is  a   new  wave  of  exchanges  and  marketmaking   models.  Now  one  idea  that  keeps  coming   up  is  something  called  a  prop  AMM,  short   for  proprietary  automated  [music]  market   maker.  On  most  decentralized  exchanges   today,  regular  users  deposit  their  funds   into  liquidity  pools  and  traders   interact  with  that  liquidity  directly.   [music]   Now,  prop  amms  flip  that  model.  Instead   of  depending  on  hundreds  or  thousands  of   depositors,  the  protocol  itself  provides   liquidity  using  its  own  capital  and  its   own  rules.  And  that  gives  the  system   more  control.  it  can  protect  itself   [music]  from  predatory  trading   strategies  that  would  normally  drain   liquidity  providers.  So,  Coinbase   Ventures  is  especially  interested  in  how   this  is  playing  out  on  Solana,  where   some  exchanges  are  experimenting  with   setups  that  limit  who  can  interact   directly  with  the  liquidity.  So,  trades   get  routed  through  aggregators  to  help   shield  liquidity  providers  and  keep   markets  healthier.  These  innovations   have  the  potential  to  improve   decentralized  trading  even  before   blockchain  upgrades  [music]  arrive.  At   the  same  time,  prediction  markets  have   become  one  of  crypto's  first  genuine   mainstream  use  cases.  But  right  now,   they're  scattered  everywhere.  Different   platforms,  different  interfaces,   different  liquidity.  So,  Coinbase   Ventures  expects  the  next  step  to  be   aggregators.  Basically,  unified   terminals  that  pull  every  prediction   market  into  one  place.  So,  imagine  a   dashboard  where  you  can  see  odds  from   every  venue,  track  all  your  positions,   and  use  advanced  trading  tools.  Now,   when  it  comes  to  the  future  of  DeFi,   Coinbase  Ventures  is  focusing  on  three   key  areas  they  believe  will  drive   growth.  The  first  is  how  perpetual   futures  are  merging  with  [music]  lending   protocols.  In  the  past,  per  lived  on   their  own  platforms,  but  now  [music]   traders  can  deposit  collateral,  earn   yield  on  it,  and  still  use  that  same   collateral  to  [music]  take  leverage   positions.  So,  no  need  to  choose  between   earning  and  trading.  And  considering   that  perpetuals  already  see  over  a   trillion  dollars  in  monthly  volume,  this   kind  of  integration  could  reshape  how   people  hedge,  earn,  and  leverage  [music]   on  chain.  The  second  idea  is  unsecured   lending  or  borrowing  without  collateral.   [music]  In  traditional  finance,   unsecured  credit  is  massive.  Think   credit  cards,  personal  loans,  and   working  capital  making  up  more  than  a   trillion  dollars  in  unsecured  [music]   credit.  But  DeFi  has  always  required   over  collateralization,  which  limits  who   can  actually  borrow.  And  that's  why   Coinbase  Ventures  [music]  believes  this   can  finally  change  by  combining  onchain   behavior  with  off-chain  reputation  and   [music]  identity  signals.  If  DeFi  can   tap  into  even  a  small  slice  of  the   trillion  dollar  unsecured  credit  market,   [music]  it  could  start  directly   competing  with  traditional  banking.  And   the  third  idea  centers  on  privacy.   [music]   Transparency  is  one  of  crypto's   strengths,  but  it's  also  one  of  its   biggest  challenges.  Most  people,  they   don't  want  their  entire  [music]   financial  history  visible  on  a  public   ledger.  So  we  might  see  the  rise  of   privacy  [music]  preserving  technologies   like  encrypted  order  books,  private   lending  systems  or  even  new  types  of   privacy  [music]  assets.  These  could   either  be  built  on  specialized   blockchains  or  added  on  top  of  existing   networks  using  advanced  cryptography.   [music]  But  the  goal  is  simple.  Keep   systems  verifiable  and  secure  without   forcing  users  to  expose  every   transaction.  Now  the  final  theme  looks   beyond  finance  and  into  the  world  of  of   course  AI  and  robotics.  One  of  the   toughest  challenges  in  robotics  today  is   gathering  the  right  kind  of  training   data.  [music]  Robots  need  to  learn  from   physical  interactions  like  grip   strength,  pressure,  and  handling  soft   materials.  But  that  data  is  extremely   hard  to  collect  [music]  at  scale.  So,   Coinbase  Ventures  thinks  that   decentralized  networks  similar  to  Deepen   could  help  gather  this  data  globally  and   that  could  speed  up  progress  [music]   in  embodied  AI  and  realworld  robotics.   They  also  highlight  another  growing   issue,  telling  humans  [music]  and  AI   apart.  We're  entering  a  world  where   nearly  any  piece  of  content  could  be  AI   generated.   >> You  didn't  even  realize,  but  I'm   completely   AI  generated.  So  they  believe  that  we'll   need  a  reliable  proof  of  humanity  layer,   something  that  verifies  that  a  real   human  stands  behind  an  action  or  a  piece   of  content.  So  this  could  involve   biometrics,  [music]   cryptographic  signatures  or  open   standards  shared  across  platforms.  They   highlight  that  worldcoin  is  one  early   attempt,  but  they  expect  multiple   solutions  to  [music]  emerge.  And  lastly,   they  expect  AI  to  dramatically  change   how  onchain  applications  are  built.   Today,  writing  secure  smart  contracts   takes  experience  and  time.  But  by  2026,   AI  agents  could  help  non-developers   launch  full  apps  in  just  hours.  These   agents  could  write  contracts,  test   [music]  them,  patch  vulnerabilities,  and   monitor  risks  automatically.  They   compare  it  to  what  GitHub  Copilot  did   for  software  development,  a  major  unlock   in  creativity  and  speed.  So,  that's  a   full  tour  of  what  Coinbase  Ventures   believes  will  shape  crypto  in  2026.  So,   these  themes  give  a  pretty  clear  look  at   what  major  investors  are  paying   attention  to,  but  let  us  know  what   you're  looking  forward  to  in  the   comments  below.
