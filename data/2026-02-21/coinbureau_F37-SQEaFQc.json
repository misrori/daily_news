    "transcript": "In  case  it  wasn't  already  obvious,  we're   now  at  the  mercy  of  the  bare  market  that   began  with  the  10th  of  October   liquidation  event  last  year.  But  could   this  bare  market  have  been  triggered  by   one  particular  cryptocurrency  that's   tied  to  a  certain  US  president?  Well,   that's  exactly  what  a  recent  report   claims.  And  it's  safe  to  say  that  its   findings  are  truly  eyeopening.  That's   why  today  we're  breaking  that  report   down  for  you  in  simple  terms,  explaining   why  we're  in  a  bare  market  and  looking   at  what  could  happen  next.  My  name  is   Guy  and  you're  watching  the  Coin  Bureau.   So,  the  report  we'll  be  summarizing   today  is  titled  quote,  \"Coincidence  or   Signal?  Did  WLFI  Telegraph  Crypto's   $6.93  billion  meltdown?\"  It  was   published  by  Amber  Data,  a  leading  data   analytics  platform.  And  as  always,  we'll   be  giving  you  the  juiciest  details  right   here  in  this  video,  but  we'll  leave  a   link  to  the  full  report  down  in  the   description  for  you  if  you  want  the   whole  enchilada.  Now,  in  case  the  title   didn't  give  it  away,  the  report's   primary  focus  is  WLFI,  the  governance   token  of  the  Trump  family's  DeFi   protocol,  World  Liberty  Financial.  The   report  explains  that  analyzing  WLFI   offers  some  rare  insights  since  it   represents  the  intersection  between  DeFi   and  politics.  As  it  happens,  a  big  chunk   of  WLFI's  supply  is  concentrated  among  a   few  insiders,  including  Trump  family   entities,  political  advisers,  and   affiliated  investors.  Now,  these   insiders  have  access  to  very  different   insights  than  plebs  like  us  do,   especially  around  political  and   regulatory  shifts  that  can  move  markets.   In  other  words,  sudden  moves  from  them   can  signal  upcoming  changes  in  the   crypto  market.  The  report  then  explains   why  this  really  matters.  On  that  fateful   day  of  the  10th  of  October,  WLFI  faced   heavy  selling  pressure  starting  at   precisely  3:32  p.m.  UTC.  more  than  5   hours  before  the  broader  crypto  market   crashed.  Given  what  world  liberties   insiders  could  have  known,  this  raises   the  question  of  whether  WLFI's  sudden   downside  move  was  actually  an  early   warning  shot.  To  figure  out  if  this  is   true,  the  report  explores  several   standout  metrics.  The  first  being  WLFI's   funding  rate.  Now,  for  those  unaware,   the  funding  rate  is  basically  what  long   traders  pay  short  traders  in  perpetual   futures  markets  to  maintain  their   positions.  Notably,  WLFI's  funding  rate   was  2.8x  higher  than  BTC's  at  2.8%   versus  Bitcoin's  1%  in  the  8  hours  prior   to  the  crash.  That  puts  WLFI's   annualized  borrowing  costs  at  roughly   131%.  This  suggests  long  traders  were   highly  speculative  despite  pressure  to   close  positions  to  avoid  losses  either   due  to  WLFI's  underperformance  or  the   cost  to  maintain  the  position  itself.   Now,  at  first  glance,  you  might  be   thinking  that  if  traders  are  happy  to  go   long  even  with  these  mounting  pressures,   then  this  is  surely  a  bullish  signal.  On   closer  inspection  though,  it  actually   presents  several  warnings.   >> Warning,  warning.  Yes,  the  substantial   premiums  being  paid  by  long  position   holders  shows  conviction  and  that's   good.  However,  it  also  shows   vulnerability.   When  that  conviction  doesn't  pay  off,   these  long  traders  are  basically   screwed.  And  since  perpetuals  markets   run  on  huge  amounts  of  borrowed  capital,   this  means  the  downside  volatility  can   be  extreme  just  like  it  was  in  WLFI's   case.  The  second  problem  is  that  WLFI's   2.8  8x  premium  over  BTC  shows  that  long   traders  were  facing  significant  pressure   compared  to  the  broader  crypto  market.   In  other  words,  there  was  far  more  risk   of  World  Liberty's  investors  being   liquidated.  Thirdly,  the  report  notes   that  positions  with  high  funding  rates   become  more  unstable  over  time,  making   them  more  and  more  sensitive  to  any   price  fluctuations,  especially  when   they're  to  the  downside.  So,  what  all  of   this  means  is  that  WLFI  positions  were   at  serious  risk  of  liquidation  well   before  positions  tied  to  BTC.  As  such,   one  could  argue  that  WLFI's  price  action   could  have  served  as  an  early  warning,   especially  given  how  the  rest  of  the   crypto  market  tanked  just  5  hours  later.   Makes  you  wonder  what  World  Liberties   Insiders  saw  coming  that  the  rest  of  us   didn't,  right?   >> I  saw  it  coming.  The  thing  is,  traders   who  spotted  this  warning  didn't  have   much  time  to  react.  Naturally,  those  who   stayed  most  up  to  date  had  the  best   chance  to  reposition.

The  next  section  of  the   report  digs  into  other  metrics  to  assess   whether  WLFI  really  was  an  early  warning   shot  to  the  broader  crypto  market.  The   report  notes  that  at  2:57  p.m.  UTC  on   the  10th  of  October,  the  day  of  the  mass   liquidations,  President  Donald  J.  Trump   posted  on  Truth  Social  that  the  US  would   impose  100%  tariffs  on  China.  Just  three   minutes  later,  something  truly  insane   happened  on  chain.  You  see,  the  report   explains  that  right  before  the   announcement,  WLFI's  average  hourly   trading  volume  was  roughly  $22  million,   which  is  pretty  standard  for  a  token  of   its  size.  But  at  300  p.m.,  just  3   minutes  after  the  announcement,  trading   volume  skyrocketed  to  over  $474   million.  That's  a  21.7  times  increase  on   the  baseline.  And  to  really  put  that   into  perspective,  the  report  adds  that   quote,  \"In  1  hour,  more  WLFI  changed   hands  than  in  the  previous  20  hours   combined.\"  The  report  explains  that  this   move  was  far  too  sudden  and  far  too   extreme  to  be  ordinary  retail  investors,   meaning  it  must  have  been  large  token   holders  exiting  fast.  In  other  words,   those  insiders  we  talked  about  earlier.   Put  simply,  insiders  with  political   connections  had  plenty  of  opportunity  to   position  themselves  ready  for  the   announcement  and  then  act  fast  once  the   news  broke  out.  In  other  words,  these   traders  could  have  potentially  avoided   insider  trading  allegations  by   positioning  themselves  in  advance  of  the   news  breaking  out  and  only  acting  once   the  news  actually  became  public.  early   enough  to  take  advantage,  but  not  too   early  that  it  breaks  any  laws  or  raises   too  much  suspicion.  Regardless,  this   triggered  WLFI's  first  sudden  move  to   the  downside.  What's  crazy,  though,  is   that  this  happened  precisely  5  hours  and   18  minutes  before  BTC  started  its  nose   dive.  During  those  5  and  abit  hours,  BTC   was  still  trading  fairly  steadily  at   around  $121,000,   while  WLFI  signaled  that  something  was   very  wrong  beneath  the  surface.  Then  at   8:50  p.m.  UTC,  Bitcoin  finally  caved   under  the  pressure  and  began  its   downward  descent,  dragging  the  rest  of   the  crypto  market  down  with  it.  What's   wild  though  is  that  while  Bitcoin's   realized  volatility  hit  84%  which  is   already  extremely  high,  WLFI's   volatility  surged  to  a  jaw-dropping  671%   roughly  8  times  higher.  Now  this  is   important  because  high  beta  assets  are   more  sensitive  to  systemic  risk  and   often  move  first  as  a  result.  An  8x   volatility  gap  means  WLFI  is  roughly   eight  times  more  sensitive  to  downside   than  Bitcoin.  So  a  1%  BTC  drop  implies   an  8%  drop  for  WLFI  and  a  5%  BTC  drop   implies  a  40%  drop  for  WLFI.  So  with   that  in  mind,  a  similar  pattern  played   out  on  the  10th  of  October,  although   less  extreme.  BTC's  price  fell  about  15%   while  WLFI  dropped  55%  putting  WLFI's   volatility  at  roughly  3.7  times  that  of   BTC's.  Notably,  if  the  same  8x  rule   applied  in  full,  then  WLFI  would  have   fallen  by  115%  or  put  differently,  it   would  have  gone  to  zero.  But  although   this  technically  means  things  could  have   been  much  worse  for  World  Liberty   investors,  the  takeaway  is  clear.  WLFI   was  far  more  sensitive  to  emerging   systematic  stress,  which  is  why  its   price  fell  well  before  BTC  even  started   moving  down.  This  is  why  the  report   notes  the  volatility  differential  as  a   leading  indicator.  Although,  one  could   argue  that  this  may  have  simply  been   because  WLFI's  market  cap  is   considerably  smaller  than  BTC's,  which   naturally  makes  it  more  volatile.   Anyway,  regardless,  the  next  part  of  the   report  examines  the  cascade  behind  the   10th  of  October  drawdown  and  compares   how  badly  different  cryptos  fell.  The   report  points  out  that  while  WLFI's  low   market  cap  meant  it  couldn't  impact   Bitcoin's  liquidity,  it  may  have   triggered  a  domino  effect.  That's   because  crypto  derivatives  traders  will   often  use  cross  margin  systems  where  a   trader's  entire  portfolio  is  used  as   collateral  for  their  leverage  trades.  So   when  the  value  of  one  asset  drops   sharply,  this  can  have  an  impact  on  that   trader's  broader  portfolio.  This  can   result  in  a  chain  reaction.  First,  the   decline  leads  to  collateral  devaluation.   Basically,  as  WLFI  fell  by  50%,  the   overall  value  of  leverage  traders   collateral  dropped  along  with  it.  This   caused  traders  to  breach  maintenance   margin  requirements,  triggering  margin   calls  across  all  their  positions.  Then   to  meet  these  requirements,  traders  can   be  forced  to  liquidate  more  liquid   assets  like  BTC  or  ETH.  These  force   sales  then  put  downward  pressure  on  the   broader  market,  which  then  triggers   additional  margin  calls  for  other   traders.  Put  simply,  this  means  the   interconnected  structure  of  leverage   traders  holding  WLFI  resulted  in  a  death   spiral  that  sent  the  entire  crypto   market  into  freef  fall.  Next,  the  report   compares  the  orderbook  liquidity  depth   of  WLFI  and  BTC,  focusing  on  liquidity   within  20  basis  points  or  0.2%  of  the   market  price  of  either  asset  since   that's  basically  the  real  liquidity  that   can  absorb  trades  before  prices  start  to   move.  During  the  massive  liquidation   event,  WLFI's  orderbook  liquidity  within   that  20  basis  point  range  fell  over  99%   from  about  1.8  million  to  just  $10,000.   But  what  might  surprise  you  even  more  is   that  in  that  same  period,  BTC's   liquidity  in  that  range  dropped  a   massive  96%  from  $311  million  to  just   $11  million.  Now  that  is  insane  given   the  sheer  volumes  that  flow  through  BTC.   In  any  case,  the  report  explains  that   quote,  \"This  highlights  a  key  market   microstructure  dynamic.  Liquidity   provision  is  asymmetric  across  market   conditions.\"  Put  simply,  when  markets   are  calm,  liquidity  isn't  an  issue.  But   under  stress,  traders  pull  their   liquidity  all  at  once.  The  result  is   that  liquidity  depth  basically   evaporates  right  when  the  market  needs   it  most.  In  WLFI's  case,  this   essentially  added  another  factor  to  the   death  spiral  I  mentioned  earlier,  where   the  margin  calls  being  triggered  caused   traders  to  sell  their  assets  and  not   just  WLFI,  resulting  in  depleted  order   book  depth,  which  increased  the  impact   of  any  further  sales  of  each  asset.   Logically,  this  then  triggered  even  more   margin  calls.  By  the  time  BTC  collapsed   at  8:50  p.m.  UTC,  three  major  factors   had  already  converged.  Leverage  traders   were  under  elevated  stress.  Orderbook   liquidity  had  depleted  for  multiple   assets  and  sentiment  among  crypto   investors  had  already  become  more   bearish.  When  combined,  there  was   nothing  to  prevent  the  automated   liquidation  cascade  that  quickly   followed.  The  report  also  looks  at   small,  mid,  and  large  cap  cryptos  to   show  how  different  brackets  were   affected.  Although  their  idea  of  small   cap  still  means  multi-billion  dollar   market  caps.  Heck,  the  smallest  crypto   mentioned  is  Ave,  sitting  at  around  $1.8   billion  at  the  time  of  shooting.  So,  I   guess  that  anything  under  $1  billion   counts  as  a  micro  cap.  Now,  who  knew?   >> Anyhow,  these  so-called  small  caps,   specifically  Uni,  Ave,  Avac,  and  Link   saw  declines  between  62%  and  71%  during   October's  liquidation  event,  while  Soul,   apparently  a  midcap,  fell  by  32%.  ETH,   the  only  large  cap,  dropped  20%  while   BTC,  labeled  a  reserve  asset,  fell  by   just  15%.  Regardless  of  the  report's   rather  odd  bracketing,  the  takeaway  is   still  clear.  Smaller  cryptos  are  more   sensitive  to  downside  pressure  from   higher  leverage,  thinner  order  books,   and  concentrated  retail  ownership.  They   feel  market  stress  much  sooner  than   larger  assets  and  tend  to  decline  first.   That  said  though,  WLFI  was  hit  hours   before  other  uh  small  caps.  The  report   argues  that  this  shows  how  highly   leveraged  tokens  with  political  ties  can   provide  early  warning  signals  for  the   broader  crypto  market.  Now,  the  next   part  of  the  report  examines  the   structural  characteristics  of  political   tokens.  The  report  reiterates  that  a   large  share  of  WLFI  was  concentrated   among  a  small  number  of  insiders.  More   importantly  though,  these  insiders  could   pass  information  to  other  insiders   within  minutes.  That's  because  holders   of  politically  affiliated  tokens   typically  move  within  the  same  circles,   attending  similar  events  and  briefings   and  can  collectively  respond  to  any   policy  signals.  They're  almost  certainly   all  in  the  same  WhatsApp  groups,  too.   Whatever  the  case,  though,  the  result  is   information  clustering  that  sets   insiders  apart  from  other  traders.  The   report  notes  that  October's  liquidation   event  raised  serious  questions  about  how   information  was  transmitted  between  WLFI   holders  and  provides  a  timeline  to   really  put  things  into  perspective.  At   2:27  p.m.  UTC,  large  short  positions   began  appearing  across  futures  markets.   30  minutes  later,  at  2:57  p.m.,  the   China  tariff  news  broke.  Just  3  minutes   after  that,  at  exactly  3  p.m.,  WLFI's   trading  volume  shot  up  by  more  than  21x.   32  minutes  later,  WLFI's  price  began  to   tank  while  BTC  remained  unaffected.  It   wasn't  until  8:50  p.m.  that  BTC  finally   broke  and  the  market  descended  into   chaos.  Essentially,  this  timeline  helps   explain  how  WLFI  crashed  so  hard  so   quickly.  Clearly,  this  wasn't  individual   retail  investors  reading  the  news  the   second  it  broke  and  analyzing  the   potential  market  impact  before  making   trading  decisions  all  within  3  minutes.   Instead,  it  points  to  a  coordinated   group  acting  on  privileged  information   before  retail  traders  even  had  a  chance.   The  report  also  notes  that  political   tokens  tend  to  have  thin  liquidity  and   higher  leverage.  WLFI's  sell  pressure   couldn't  be  absorbed  by  its  shallow  $1.8   8  million  order  book.  While  its  131%   annualized  funding  rate  was   unsustainable  for  leverage  long  traders   and  with  volatility  running  8x  higher   than  Bitcoin,  WLFI  showed  how  vulnerable   political  tokens  are  even  to  small  price   drops.  Logically,  these  traits  are  meant   to  drive  speculative  upside  potential.   But  as  we  all  know,  tokens  can  fall  just   as  fast  as  they  can  rise,  if  not  faster.   As  seen  during  the  liquidations,  the   lower  the  market  cap,  the  greater  the   downside  risk.  This  is  why  WLFI  fell   first,  hours  ahead  of  the  rest  of  the   market.  In  any  case,  the  report  notes   that  quote,  \"The  October  10th  cascade   demonstrates  that  political  tokens   function  as  information  transmission   mechanisms.  WLFI's  initial  sell-off   basically  gave  a  5h  hour  and  18minute   warning  that  pain  was  coming.  And  while   many  have  disregarded  WLFI's  market   impact  due  to  its  low  market  cap,  its   high  lever  positions  and  its  political   ties  made  it  a  key  indicator  that  in   retrospect  we  shouldn't  have  ignored.  In   the  report's  words,  quote,  \"In   interconnected  leverage  systems,  the   weakest  structural  link  provides  the   earliest  signal  of  systematic  stress.\"   Wise  words.  Anyhow,  now  that  the  crypto   market  is  left  licking  its  wounds,   leverage  will  start  to  rebuild.  If  we   see  more  political  tensions,  which,   let's  face  it,  are  highly  likely,  then   WLFI  may  have  inadvertently  provided  the   perfect  template  for  spotting  early   warning  signals  from  political  tokens   before  it's  too  late.  So  if  we  want  to   avoid  getting  wrecked  again,  then  we   should  probably  be  watching  political   tokens  very  closely,  paying  extra   attention  to  any  spikes  in  volume,  any   divergences  in  volatility,  and  any   funding  rate  stress.  If  any  of  these   materialize  again,  then  well,  I  think   you  can  work  out  the  rest.  And  with   that,  folks,  we've  reached  the  end  of   the  report.  And  I'll  remind  you  that  you   can  find  the  full  thing  in  the   description  below.  For  now  though,   you're  probably  wondering  what  this   means  for  the  future  of  the  crypto   market.  Well,  we  think  there's  a  few   important  lessons  to  be  learned  from   today's  report.  And  the  first  lesson  is   the  impact  that  smaller  cryptos  can   potentially  have  on  the  broader  market.   We  all  know  that  the  crypto  market  is   largely  driven  by  BTC's  price  action.   And  given  that  tokens  like  WLFI  are  much   smaller,  it's  easy  to  assume  that  this   extra  volatility  is  to  be  expected.  And   to  be  fair,  this  is  still  the  case.  That   said  though,  we  should  probably  be  more   aware  of  how  this  volatility  also  makes   it  easier  to  trigger  liquidations.  And   as  we  now  know,  these  liquidations  can   have  farreaching  implications  for   cryptos  much  larger  than  the  one  in   question.  If  this  shows  anything,  then   it's  that  leverage  is  now  deeply  rooted   in  the  crypto  market,  and  this  can  have   unexpected  consequences  that  most   traders  wouldn't  even  consider.  Another   lesson  that  we  should  take  from  this  is   how  whales  with  large  allocations  can   impact  a  crypto's  price  when  they  decide   to  dump  their  tokens.  Now,  to  be  fair,   this  is  something  that  almost  every   crypto  investor  is  well  aware  of,  but   nothing  really  brings  that  risk  to  light   more  than  seeing  it  happen  before  your   very  eyes.  And  this  relates  to  another   important  lesson,  and  that's  to  be  aware   of  who  these  whales  are.  Unfortunately,   this  is  usually  easier  said  than  done,   but  any  information  you  can  uncover  on  X   or  in  news  articles  can  reveal  a  lot   about  an  investor's  intentions,   especially  for  political  tokens  like   WLFI.  It's  not  exactly  uncommon  for   politicians  to  prioritize  their  own   interests,  which  puts  it  rather   politely.  And  this  brings  us  to  the   biggest  lesson  of  all.  Never  ever  trust   a  politician.  WLFI  proved  how  insiders   can  pose  a  real  threat  to  the  average   investor  and  the  evidence  is  pretty   clear.  Political  insiders  positioned   themselves  in  advance  and  acted  almost   in  unison  in  just  3  minutes  over  5  hours   before  BTC  collapsed,  suggesting  WLFI's   insiders  may  have  helped  trigger   crypto's  biggest  liquidation  wipeout  on   record.  In  other  words,  President  Trump   may  have  helped  spark  the  bull  market,   but  his  DeFi  protocol  seems  to  have   stopped  it  in  its  tracks.  First  he   giveth,  then  he  taketh  away.  Funny  how   that  works,  isn't  it?  All right,  folks.   That's  quite  enough  controversy  for  one   video,  but  hey,  if  you  want  more,  then   why  not  check  out  this  one  right  over   here,  which  explores  why  Bitcoin  was  in   the  Epstein  files.  Yes,  really.  And  if   you're  one  of  the  many  people  wondering   why  your  altcoins  underperformed,  then   we  may  have  the  answer  for  you  in  the   video  right  over  here.  Okay,  thank  you   all  for  watching  and  I'll  see  you  again   soon.  This  is  Guy  signing  off.",

    "summary_hu": "A riport kiemeli, hogy a WLFI token mennyire érzékenyen reagált a piaci mozgásokra, különösen Donalt Trump politikai bejelentése után, ami a kriptopiac összeomlásához vezetett. Az elemzés rávilágít, hogy a WLFI-nek sok insiderje van, akik különböző piaci információkhoz férnek hozzá, így a token kereskedése lehetett a piaci stressz korai jele. Amikor WLFI ára 50%-kal csökkent, ez a jelenség domino hatást váltott ki a piacon, aminek következtében más nagyobb kriptók, mint a Bitcoin is esni kezdtek. Továbbá, a riport hangsúlyozza, hogy a politikai kapcsolatokkal bíró tokenek nagyobb kockázatot jelenthetnek és súlyosbítják a piaci feszültségeket. A felfedezések alapján a politikai tokenek érzékelhetik a piaci stresszt, és információs közvetítőként működhetnek a kriptopiacon.",
    "summary_en": "The report highlights how the WLFI token reacted sensitively to market movements, particularly following a political announcement by Donald Trump, which contributed to the crash of the cryptocurrency market. The analysis underscores that WLFI has many insiders who have access to various market insights, making its trading a potential early indicator of market stress. When WLFI's price dropped by 50%, this phenomenon triggered a domino effect in the market, leading to decreases in other larger cryptos like Bitcoin. Additionally, the report emphasizes that politically connected tokens can represent greater risks and exacerbate market tensions. The findings suggest that political tokens can sense emerging market stress and serve as information transmission mechanisms in the cryptocurrency landscape.",
