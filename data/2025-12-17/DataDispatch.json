        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. Hope you guys are all having a wonderful day as we finally see a little bit of a fresh breath and some buying pressure, some relief that's coming into the markets after, you know, multiple days of selloffs and even in the individual names coming down like 30 to 50%. Uh, one of the big things that we do have today is Palanteer comes up about 3% currently is at the top of a resistance area in a large consolidation zone after a new pretty shocking price target which by the end of next year will be interesting to see if this is achieved. We'll be talking about this and what analyst uh initiated this price target. also on top of the broader market, what we have from some of the macroeconomic data today, making sense of that and what's in store for us. And we'll be finalizing with crypto and how the data center stocks doing. So, if you're a new or returning viewer, hit that like button and subscribe for daily videos. Let's get it up. Let's try to hit 30,000 subscribers. Pop it up on the screen here. Palanteer at 18751. And we see, like I said, a decent amount of buying pressure. You can see Palanteer here is but back above its 50 and its 200 day moving but back above that 50 right here at 186. In terms of a resistance in the short term, you know, Palanteer has been trading in this long base here with, you know, of course that breakout to, you know, Palanteer that went to 207 basically dropping down here to 147. But back in this consolidation zone between 170 and this 187 basically at the top of these resistance points and we've had multiple touch points right here. I've talked about this before as you know just technically uh this is a very important area for Palanteer and it's served as support through volatility. Um, in terms of resistance here, if we see any type of a push through that zone, if Palanteer is able to get above and hold above that, possibly even close above this resistance area around this 187, literally right where it is right now, that's where you could have a possible push back into the mid190s, all depending on the macroeconomic environment. That's what we do have. The big question is there's only like a few trading days left, like literally 9.5 trading days I believe left in 2025. A lot of people are looking in terms of seasonality. Low seasonality always does not repeat itself. However, historically, the last 15 days of December typically are well for the markets. Uh so we'll see what happens. Now what we do have here is that Palunteer Bank of America here reiterates a buy rating on Palunteer amid government and AI growth. And this analyst right here maintain a buy rating in a street high $255 price target here representing a 39% upside from the current trading levels. And to think of Palanteer at 255 is ast, you know, absolutely insane considering its current price to earnings right here is at 428 with the market cap. Pretty much shy of half a trillion, 447 billion as we speak. But you know, Palanteer has continued to defy everybody that is criticized against it. So enterprise use of Palanteers, you know, at this point [snorts] let it hit 20 255. I wouldn't be surprised. Uh the companies right here basically talking about uh you know Palenter's artificial intelligence platforms in terms of its ties with the government commercial and its most recent contract we saw with the Navy the whole ship operating system to help detect supply chain bottlenecks and working on continue product enhancement. So you know Palanteer is able to really kind of work its way and find its niche into every particular business that has an issue and find a way to improve it. Um, I think this is just going to continue as the AI trade continues to develop. So, awesome for Palanteer, especially to see a very bullish price target that comes out all during the time that we have a lot of these AI top callers. Um, and speaking of AI top callers and big headlines, more bullishness coming in for the whole AI trade. Amahaba posted this today saying that Amazon is in talks to invest over 10 billion billion in open AI valuing over $500 billion saying open AI plans to use Amazon's tranium AI chips bullish for Amazon not saying he's saying here not really bearish for Nvidia but more just talking about here how is open AAI going to continue to get every single important tech company to invest in them uh not get phased out by other types of competition like Google and up coming through right here. Um, but what you can see here, nonetheless, regardless of the competition, I actually like the competition here from the MAG7s and from the high, you know, private companies, uh, like Anthropic, Anduro, you know, all those competitions for the AI race. I do like that. Um, in terms of a bullish perspective over the next kind of industrial trade, over the next decade, that's going to be what AI is. Um you can see Amazon here showing some confidence within that AI trade in itself and showing that demand is still very strong. Uh in terms of the actual macroeconomic data that we got today for the U November US jobs report, payrolls come in here at 65,000 versus an estimated 50,000. So in November we added jobs. Good. At least that was good for the economy. However, the only kind of piece of uncertainty was that unemployment here came in at 4.6% 6% versus an estimated 4.5 uh and average hourly earnings right here.1% month overmonth versus estimated.3. Uh it says here, you know, jobs still growing, but the labor market continues to cool uh keeping pressure off inflation in the Fed. And so I think the Fed did a really good job uh continuing to cut its interest rates and what we saw from its recent rate cut, especially with the unemployment rate that is continuing to rise. This shows you here the Fed needed to cut rates and it looks like things are kind of playing out. to the market kind of like this today. Uh we see that here stock futures are slipping today. They say this is kind of a mixed bag of results. Um but however, this isn't necessarily a bad report that I'm personally seeing. Uh in terms of what we see on the S&P 500 index is literally a close right at 6800. Now, a close at 6800. Um, that's a pretty important zone because over the last month here, we've seen a lot of trading and basically support right at that level. Uh, in terms we saw a little bit of a pullback actually today at 6762, but that kind of quickly recovered to the 6,800 support here. So, in order for the bulls to maintain control and specifically looking at SPY right here, uh I think we need to see a recovery over this 200, this nice moving average right here above 680. It'd be great to see if SPY can give about 680. We see futures are down or basically I guess not really down but down 19 cents. 03%. So, basically opening up flat right now as we speak. Uh a lot of eyeballs. will be looking for CPI data. That'll be coming out on Thursday. And in terms of the unemployment rate, it is currently at the highest level since September of 2021. So that's where you see a little bit of uncertainty that lies kind of ahead. But I think this is further reassuring the need for cutting rates, which the market finds bullish and that's kind of what the expectations are. Um, in terms of cryptocurrency, how is that doing? We saw remember Bitcoin had a lot of selling pressure. people are just getting mad and impatient with crypto. Um, this this is the wild wild west in terms of a trading type of asset. Um, but I like the whole tokenization play for over the next 5 years. We see it with the big banks that are really getting involved with tokenization. All the traditional finance kind of big platforms working to get this incorporated somehow into their systems. Um, that's what I do like and that's what I'm bullish on, especially with an administration that does welcome this. uh with Bitcoin right here at 87,000. You see just a little bit of buying pressure kind of holding here, consolidating basically Ethereum. Hopefully we see this retake the 3,000 and be able to hold there. You know how that relates to Tom Lee's BMR at 3161. We've seen support that's been held at the 30 which is an important level for BMR to hold. Uh you know BMR of course is going to have its own technical structures but is highly highly correlated to the actual changing value of Ethereum. Uh, nonetheless though, we see Tom Lee that is continuing to buy Ethereum at a rapid pace. Bought another here uh 140 million worth just buying it like no other handover fist trying to get to that 5%. Uh, you know, that is their goal. We're also seeing investors like Kathy Wood right here heavily rotating in crypto and cryptoreated positions. Um, her moves and swings are always interesting, but cool to see here. At least we're starting to see a little bit of a buying pressure across the board. In terms of the data center trade, we're finally starting to see a little bit of recovery here. You see I ran comes up about 3% today. Uh in terms of this local bottom, we'll see if this bottom, you know, gets tested again in terms of support right here at 34 at least. We were able to see a little bit of recovery. Um Cipher kind of just hanging out right here right around the 15. Some resistance at the 15. You got corewave now still under 70 technically literally at 69 93 and Nebius right here at 81. So uh not huge moves from the data center trades though. However, uh it's good to see that we didn't see huge moves to the red. Finally, these things might be cooling off a little bit. Our sellers possibly getting exhausted. Uh hopefully cuz right now I have a bullish outlook on the AI data center stock. So I guess we'll see what happens, you know, longterm. Um however, like I said, bullish still across the board. Um, I like kind of how the market's finally starting to take a little bit of a breather. We'll see if we get a little bit of a rally into the end of the year here or if Santa Claus rally will be cancelled. What do you think about it down in the comments? Do you think we're going to get that or do you think that the Grinch is coming here and taking away all the gains? Peace out. Take care and I'll catch you guys all"
