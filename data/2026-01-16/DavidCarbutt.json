        "transcript": "We've got three great clips today looking at Nvidia, Google, and Apple where Nvidia's still the play, the Apple Google Gemini deal, and then Kathy Wood's team, Arch Invest, having a discussion about the state of Apple and what the future of the company could look like. Check this out. So, you know better than I that this is such a battleground. you know, whether you can still stay with Nvidia because there's so much potential upside or whether it's time to rotate as uh our last guest argued this week that it's time to rotate into other parts of the industry. So, why does Nvidia have so much staying power, you think? >> Well, I mean, first, you know, we're actually rotating, you know, within this space and uh our our favorite pick for most of the last year has actually been Micron. uh which you know at the time we considered that sort of the poor man's way of of playing AI because of the attractive valuation the fundamentals we saw uh around that it's not so poor anymore micron's up about 300% year to date amazing call by the way >> if you're right that Nvidia has that much upside and it's going to triple that would be quite something >> that that would be great but uh but you know right now you know we see the opportunity in Nvidia because the multiple has pulled back a bit stock hasn't done much in the last 6 months and we do see some pretty strong fundamentals ahead for uh for this year. The most important thing however and I think what's most uh misunderstood about Nvidia is most of this upside much of this upside is actually coming from pricing and I think the concern on Nvidia right now is about competitive pressure others who can do chips and AI uh you know are they going to be able to to maintain their market position and we think the pricing tells the story there about both the sustainable competitive advantage they have as well as their ability to sustain the margins. Who else? So when you say that you to some extent you are rotating, right? Um but for instance when you say Micron was the pick last year but this year do you just say well it's kind of it's in the market now. I'm curious what you would do with as as others are are looking you know elsewhere for the next big upside. Um you landed back at Nvidia. >> We did and I said and to be clear we still like Micron. We still have a outperform rating on that stock. Uh it's just that it's it's much less non-conensus as compared to last year. But Nvidia's case right now again the multiple is in the low 20s right now on 26 numbers uh we see upside to those numbers and again you know we talked about the pricing dynamic as you go into 2027 they have another big product cycle uh the product's called Ruben Ultra where you have more memory on the chip you go from two GPUs to chip to four GPUs you increase the power the whole premise of Nvidia right now is one delivering value to the customers, providing more performance per watt, more performance per dollar so that you can do more inference with the same amount of money which the you know folks like like open AI surely need uh in addition to uh again you know ming maintaining that competitive advantage against everyone else and that's what we see over the next two years which is why we think it's a good value right now >> and what's your response when people say look at Gemini I mean every time you turn around they look they we're using it in the house more uh From a user point of view, it's being integrated into Siri now. So, we're recreating the Apple, Google, you know, iPhone, I don't want to call it monopoly. >> If they're using different types of processing units, these TPUs at the margin, does that erode at in Nvidia's, you know, possible addressable market? >> Well, it's already in the GE TPUs already been in the market now. And I absolutely believe that TPU is Nvidia's uh biggest competitor right now because the performance of those products are uh you know closest to Nvidia than everyone else. But there's good reason for that because Google's been at it you know it's a the TPU is going on at seventh generation right now. So they're really the only ones with that staying power that have been at this long enough. And I should say it's not just the chip itself but it's also all the networking and the systems right now. the chip performance alone is not enough to drive the performance that the customers need right now. There's a lot of other things and so I absolutely believe that that TPU is the closest competitor, but it's also because it's owned by Google, it it's not going to be sold to the entirety of the market. Nvidia's pricing power proves they got a moat that competitors can't touch. The fact that they're raising prices while everyone talks about competition tells you everything about their actual market position. So Chris makes this point by saying the upside in Nvidia isn't just coming from selling more chips, it's coming from pricing. Because when you can raise prices in a supposedly competitive market, you're basically showing everyone that the competition isn't strong enough. If AMD or custom chips or TPUs were actually breathing down Nvidia's neck, they'd be cutting prices to defend market share. Instead, they're doing the opposite. That's not what happens when you're worried about competitors. The competitive pressure narrative is everywhere right now. Every earnings call someone asks about custom silicon, about AMD, and about whether hyperscalers are going to build their own chips and cut Nvidia out. Chris is saying, \"Look at the pricing, not the headlines. Nvidia is charging more for Reuben Ultra than they did for Blackwell. They're not acting like a company that's scared. They're acting like a company that knows customers have no real alternative if they want performance. When you control the performance per watt and performance per dollar equation that OpenAI and everyone else needs, you also set the pricing. Chris mentions the networking, the systems, the software stack. Google spend seven generations building TPU and they're getting close to Nvidia's performance, which sounds bad for Nvidia until you realize close it's a good enough and it took them about 10ish years to get there. Plus, TPU only really works with Google at the moment. So, even their closest competitor isn't really competing for the same customers. Everyone else, like AMD, startups, and anyone building custom chips, they're not even close to being close to Nvidia yet. They're solving problems Nvidia solved three product cycles ago. For a company that's raising prices and has line of sight to another product cycle in 2027 that doubles performance again, the market's pricing in competition that doesn't exist and might not exist for years. Micron was non-conensus a year ago. Nvidia's a non- consensus now. Same logic, different timing. If you're loving things AI, and it's all a bit complicated at the moment, I built a course I wish I had when I first started researching AI. It breaks down everything from chips to frontier models to the application layer in bite-sized chunks, so it's easy to learn. Purchase the course below and get lifetime access. The price will increase as we add new modules, which we're considering doing soon. Speaking of Google, their TPU chips came up in that conversation as Nvidia's closest competitor, but Google's trying to win the consumer AI race and they just made a massive move with Apple. Dan Ies breaks down why Apple just partnered with Google to power Siri with Gemini. And his argument is that this is Apple's smartest business decision that they could have made given where they are. >> Let's talk about the benefits for Apple first. Why the reaffirmation of 350? Why is this good for them in app intelligence? >> Look, they've had an invisible AI strategy. I mean, if you go back to like the last WWDC's, you felt like Michael J. Fox, Back to the Future, right? There was really nothing there talking about AI. Finally, this is a huge step forward and it's not going to happen internally. Had to happen from Google, Gemini. Look, and it comes down to like if they never win DOJ suit, this doesn't happen. So, so it speaks to just brick by brick they're finally building and I think this is going to be instrumental to the valuation for Apple this year. >> If you look at the statement that was put out, it was very much for the time being this is going to be embedded in Apple foundation models. The idea is that they they pull away. They are able to get a grip on their own foundational models and indeed Siri becoming actually useful. Do you think they will distance themselves from Google over time? Look, I think there's a better chance of me playing NFL playoffs than Apple doing something internally at this point. Look, the reality is this is also a game of high stakes poker negotiation that's going on too terms of a broader deal with Google that that I think they're ultimately going to have to do. Look, I think this will be exclusive and because my view is that there's going to be some sort of subscription service premium. You also need a platform for developers. And it comes down to like the AI revolution. Like Apple's watch it from the sidelines, from the stands. They need to get into the game. And that's why we talk about $7,500 per share that this adds to the story as they execute on the consumer AI revolution finally going through Certino. Dan, you um you had advocated on more than one occasion that Apple by Perplexity with this confirmation of Gemini being the underpinning of Siri. Is such a transaction still necessary to your mind? >> Yeah, and Ed, it's a great point, but a lot of that was based on as the DOJ suit was going on with Google, there was a sort of period there where Apple needed to do something. Now, obviously, perplexity came and went. They're clearly not going to do that. But once Google won the DOJ suit, that was sort of like green light, lights on, and now it's sort of go time for big tech. And I think that speaks to why Apple did this deal. And look, you look at Google Gemini, what they've done. You go back a year ago, it's phenomenal. And I think Apple is making that bet. It's going to be a much different 2026 than 2025 relative to Apple when it comes to AI. Again, car just made the point that um Apple was very careful in the statement to explain which parts of Siri functionality would be underpinned by by Gemini. The other way of looking at is to say, have they still got a lot of work to do to make Siri sort of all-encompassing AI assistant? >> I mean, look, it's a it's an Everest like uphill battle cuz the reality is they've lost so many developers. They've lost so much talent. You've seen a lot changing and look Ed you know it as well as anyone like the the DNA of Certino a lot of that is supposed to come internally and I think Cook recognized look writing on the wall it speaks to my point that like Cook is not going to leave as CEO and leave this sort of in transition he has to get the AI strategy sorted out it's going to be a work in progress but 2.4 4 billion iOS devices, 1.5 billion iPhones. It's my view that the consumer AI revolution ultimately comes through Certino and this is a first step in that direction. We'll obviously see more about in the spring and of course more WWDC. >> Some might say it's incredibly savvy to be AI like to not have to make all the investments in the data centers to be able to say look privacy first. We're going to lean much more on edge AI. Is that actually going to be a winning formula for Apple in the in the future and as models and sophistication develops? >> Yeah. Look, but also Apple's in a much different situation because of the unrivaled install base because of where they play in the consumer. That's why like from a capex perspective, they're not Microsoft, Google, you know, many other big tech players. But I think they finally hit the point rubber met the road. They needed to do something. They're going to have to incrementally spend, but they're basically going to rely on Google as a partner because you cannot have the fourth industrial revolution, biggest tech transition the last 40 years, come and go and they don't monetize. And I think that's something that they recognize front and center. And it's key to the stock. I mean, realistically, like a year from now, stocks 350 or lower from here. It's all based on AI and them monetizing it. Apple's aggressive move to integrate Gemini shows that they're finally understanding the AI game and controlling billions of devices means they can win even if they didn't build the model themselves. Dan Ives is saying Apple just made the smartest move they could have made given where they are. Yeah, they're behind on AI, but they've got something nobody else has, which is direct access to billions of iPhone users. And the Gemini deal lets them turn that access into actual AI features without spending 3 years and $50 billion building data centers. This distribution advantage here is massive. Siri can actually be useful because it's powered by Gemini. They're leveraging someone else's R&D to solve their immediate problems, which is that iOS users are switching to Android or just not upgrading because Apple's AI features are terrible. Fix Siri, fix Apple Intelligence, and suddenly the upgrade cycle makes sense. Again, that's worth way more than the pride of building everything internally. That mentions the subscription angle, and I think that's where this gets really interesting. If Apple goes premium on AI features, basic stuff is free. Advanced features cost 10 or 20 bucks a month. You're talking about adding a completely new revenue stream to the install base. Even if only 10% of iPhone users pay for premium AI features, that could be hundreds of millions of subscribers at $15 a month. That's billions in annual recurring revenue. The timing works to you because a DOJ loss for Google means this partnership doesn't have regulatory risk hanging over it. Apple was clearly waiting to see how that played out before committing. Now they can go all in on Gemini. The CEO succession question has been out there for years, but you don't hand off the company in the middle of the biggest platform shift in a decade. Kathy Wood asked this question. Let's see what the Ark Invest team had to say. >> Can I ask another question? The new the the person rumored to succeed um Tim Cook is what's his background? Is there I mean they have had just a rotation of management teams around anything AI. Do they does this guy have the chops? >> He's uh VP of hardware engineering John Turners. And there was also this is great that you brought this up Kathy because there were more rumors that came out this weekend around Tim Cook. He allegedly told people he was tired. He's you know looking to get out potentially. So this could happen, you know, this management change could happen faster than most people think. >> Interesting. >> And I I also think maybe >> it's a 50-year-old company. This is like it's really kind of amazing to think about. Uh it's a half ccentury old. Um it's not a surprise that this is a company that's looking more like IBM than it is looking at like some disruptive kind of like nimble, you know, mover. It would be really interesting to hear what Apple management thinks about AI generally, like what direction they think AI is going because then you'd be able to read into this decision because the way that I understand this is they're they're probably saying, \"Okay, we're behind, right? And to catch up, we're going to need to deploy tens of billions of dollars into compute to build our own foundation models.\" Instead, they're going, \"Hey, let's go to our friends over at Google. Let's license Gemini.\" Gemini is at the frontier of, you know, most of these benchmarks. Let's license that technology, bring it into Siri, and then deploy different features that we know will be, you know, great for our users. Now, the problem, Brett, is that when you do that, you're beholdened to updates from Google, right? like Gemini. If you're using Gemini technology, then your technology only gets better when Gemini technology gets better, which I think is a safe bet for Apple to make going, well, Google's always going to be deploying, you know, tens of billions of dollars compute, so Gemini is always going to be getting better, so all we really need to do is essentially fine-tune this model for what Apple users will use it for, which may not really there's there's there's like a a really telling actually very close parallel here, which is Microsoft has open unfettered access to OpenAI's IP from the start and continuously to fine-tune it and refine it to deploy just against its office suite as co-pilot. And far and away the most useful use of these tools is in um at least in terms of productivity delivering is in using basically like knowledge worker office products of which Microsoft dominates and you can survey everybody and everybody hates copilot and people love cloud they love openai they actually like gymni like they like things that are not the cludgy attempt to integrate with the existing product software suite. I I think that's a strong sign that you know uh Apple at further arms length from Google with kind of lesser AI talent is not going to be able to take this thing and turn it into this thing that suddenly becomes a magical consumer experience. Uh there's like it's almost astounding how bad co-pilot is given it should be the same underlying model as openai's model. In fact, co-pilot should be dominating kind of enterprise productivity use of AI because of their distribution advantage. And it's demonstrabably not. We need to learn from that lesson here on the consumer side as well. Picture this. A potential client searches for what your business offers and your YouTube video appears. Before they've even booked a call, they've built trust with you, turning them into a warm lead. That's why our clients are hitting $100,000 months because YouTube turns attention into authority. If you run a business, book a call and I'll show you exactly how to make this"
