    "transcript": "Oh  yes  guys,  it's  Friday.  Let's  make   some  money.  First  and  foremost,  Bitcoin   is  still  above  the  buy  zone.  If  we  go   into  the  buy  zone,  feel  free  to  deploy,   but  very  slowly  because  we  can  still  go   way  deeper  into  the  buy  zone.  And  I'm   actually  expecting  around  40k  for   Bitcoin  within  the  coming  months.  So   let's  see  what's  going  to  happen.  But   overall  here  within  the  buy  zone   longterm,  you  will  see  that  this  is   fantastic,  fantastic  prices.  Now,  as  you   know,  currently  the  way  the  way  to  make   money  every  day  in  crypto  is  shorting.   When  I  look  at  my  community  in  Discord,   I  see  all  of  the  bangers  being  the  short   trades.  They  are  producing  each  and   every  day  as  you  can  see  right  here.  And   so,  how  do  we  know  what  to  short?  Well,   it's  very  easy.  If  you  have  Bullmania,   you  go  to  scanner.bullmania.com.   And  then  you  can  see  what  recently   flipped  bearish.  This  is  the  cheat  code   because  you  don't  want  to  short   something  random,  something  that  kind  of   looks  weak,  kind  of.  You  want  to  know   for  sure  that  something  is  in  a  bare   trend.  And  when  something  is  in  a  bare   trend,  you  know  that  the  chances  are  it   will  continue  go  lower  and  the  cars  are   stacked  in  your  favor.  That's  the  most   important  aspect.  I  mean,  look  here.  If   I  look  at  what  if  we  bearish  in  the  last   month  and  then  we  see  the  losses,  it's   quite  big  losses.  This  is  fantastic   shortable  opportunities.  My  minus  67,   river  minus  85.  And  if  I  look  at  our   community  who  have  access  to  the  uh   money  scanner,  many  of  them  have  shorted   myx.  Here's  a  guy  for example  shorting   myx.  This  was  already  a  few  days  ago  on   the  14th.  And  as  you  can  see,  this  is   the  power  of  knowing  what  flips  bearish   in  real  time.  So  you  have  dusk,  you  have   sky  and  so  on  so  forth.  But  of  course,   we  want  to  know  what  flipped  recently.   So  let's  check  during  the  last  three   days.  What  flips  do  we  have?  You  have   for  example  this  a  network.  What  hell  it   is?  Nobody  cares.  But  you  can  still   short  it  already  here.  You  see  it  fell   quite  a  lot.  It  fell  quite  a  lot.  If  we   look  here,  it's  already  down  28%.  Can  it   still  go  lower?  I  wouldn't  short  it  now.   Uh  the  time  to  short  it  was  when  it  was   just  breaking  down.  Okay.  And  this  is   what  we  told  to  our  community  that  when   you  have  a  breakdown  like  this  and  then   there's  basically  no  big  support  until  a   massive  massive  massive  support  area   down  here  is  fantastic.  But  this  one  I   would  say  already  reached  that  target.   Let's  see  if  something  else  look  better.   For  example,  derive.  You  see  this  one   hasn't  dropped  a  lot  uh  since  one  day   ago.  It  is  bearish.  So  let's  see  how   good  this  one  is.  This  one  has  the   chance  to  go  down  here  and  test  this   support  right  here.  And  it  is  in  bare   trend.  And  that's  a  very  very  nice  trade   you  can  take  now  of  approximately  13   15%.  But  of  course  with  leverage  is  way   more.  And  if  you  want  to  trade  with   leverage  you  need  to  do  it  on  trusted   pages.  So  if  you  go  to   bullmania.com/partners,   it  is  a  URL  you  find  in  the  description.   You're  going  to  see  all  the  exchanges  I   use.  So  just  check  in  description.  So   sign  up  on  buyit.  Click  here.  You  get   fantastic  big  fat  signup  bonus  on  buy   bit  up  to  30k  depending  on  your  on  your   deposit.  If  you  want  less  KYC  then   scroll  down  go  to  bionex  bit  unix  or   weeks.  On  weeks  for example  you  also   have  fantastic  fantastic  signup  bonus.   So  do  it  right  now  and  just  click  around   and  sign  up  on  all  of  them.  I  mean  you   get  freebies,  you  get  signup  bonus  on   all  of  them  and  you  support  the  channel   but  most  importantly  you  vacuum   absolutely  vacuum  the  signup  bonus  which   is  so  important  in  this  bearish  time.   Now  let's  check  this  one.  Humanity  also   justly  bearish  two  days  ago.  If  we  look   at  it  what's  happening  justly  bearish   and  the  support  is  likely  going  to  be   somewhere  here.  So  you  have  a  very  very   nice  short  here  of  approximately  35%   with  leverage  even  more  obviously.  U   let's  see  what  else  we  have.  We  have  a   compound  man  if  compound.  Let's  see  how   much  compound  has  been  uh  dumping.  It  is   in  a  big  big  bare  trend  already.  And  it   seems  that  it  wants  to  start  a  new  leg   down  here.  The  thing  is  it's  down  so   much  already  on  the  um  on  the  big   picture.  I  would  just  be  okay  with  it   going  here  and  I  would  be  taking  profits   somewhere  here  and  then  maybe  do  a  new   trade.  So  it's  10%  with  leverage  of   course  way  more.  You  do  5x  it  can  be   50%.  But  if  it  starts  breaking  down   here,  then  um  uh  I  would  probably  see  it   as  a  new  trade.  It  could  get  support   here.  It  could  absolutely  get  support   here.  Uh  but  yeah,  you  have  a  good  good   setup  here  uh  for  uh  for  taking  a  shot.   Then  let's  check  Cow  Protocol  also   recently  flipped.  Let's  see  how  much  has   been  falling  before.  This  one  has  a   fantastic  fantastic  trade  here  uh  to   this  support  uh  very  very very  nice   short-term  trade  of  approximately  30%.   So  this  thing  can  fall  30%.  You  can  go   to  weeks,  you  can  go  to  buy  a  bit,  put   in  a  trade  now,  get  the  bonus.  You're   going  to  be  part  of  it.  That's  that.  And   also,  by  the  way,  as  you  know,  with  all   leverage,  you  need  to  have  stop  loss.   You  need  to  have  the  mechanical  rules.   Like  you  need  everything.  So  go  to   bullmania.com  if  you  want  to  learn  how   to  put  the  stop-loss,  how  to  how  to   apply  the  mechanical  rules  because   really  it's  end  to  end.  You  need  the   mechanical  rules,  you  need  the  money   line,  you  need  the  money  scanner  to  get   access  to  money  scanner.  Also  go  to   bullming.com,  watch  the  free  training   and  you're  going  to  learn  how  to  join   us.  Now,  um,  Pocket  Network,  what's   Let's  see  here.  Just  flipped  bearish  not   that  long  ago.  And  this  one  is  quite   juicy.  I  mean,  this  one  you  see  quite   some  long  consolidation  here.  Can   easily,  guys,  can  easily  go  here.  And   that's  a  fantastic  fantastic  trade  for   you  in  real  time  here  of  uh  20%.  Uh,   with  leverage  obviously  more.  And  you   see  the  beauty  here.  You  see  the  beauty   of  short-term  trading  in  this  kind  of   environment  we're  in  right  now.   Short-term  trading  is  how  most  people   make  money.  It  is  shorting.  It's   shorting.  Now,  I  mean,  as  you  see  in  my   in  our  community,  some  people  they  don't   want  to  short.  Uh  it's  okay,  but  then   you  miss  out  on  50%  of  crypto.  Crypto  is   bull  50%  of  the  time,  then  bare  50%  of   the  time.  Okay.  To  be  fair,  bull  is   maybe  60  70%  of  the  time,  and  then  we   have  a  year  of  bear.  So  if  you  are  uh   not  shorting,  if  you  if  you  don't  know   how  to  do  it,  you're  afraid,  go  to   bullnay.com  because  I  mean  you  you  need   to  learn  to  really  have  the  full   picture,  the  full  asset  uh  the  asset   access  in  both  direction,  the  full  not   asset  access  but  the  full  toolbox   toolbox  you  need  the  all  the  tools.  So   shorting  is  obviously  a  very  important   tool.  So  that's  that.  Let's  see  what   else  we  have.  And  then  some  turned   bearish  and  are  up  a  bit.  Let's  see.   Let's  check  Gnosis  for  example.  Is   bearish  but  um  got  a  bit  of  a  pump  here.   This  one  yeah  uh  wouldn't  surprise  me  at   all  guys.  If  Gnosis  now  goes  towards   here   and  um  potentially  get  support  here  in   the  uh  below.  So  how  much  down  is  that?   Yeah,  20%  down  for  Gnosis.  And  as  you   can  see,  we  don't  we're  not  really   betting  on  anything  going  to  zero  or   anything  like  doing  anything  crazy.   We're  just  looking  at  where  the  momentum   is  turning  bearish  and  then  we're   shorting  until  the  next  support.  So  this   is  how  you  don't  really  have  to,  you   know,  make  big  bet  or  assume  that   something  is  going  to  go  from  big  price   to  to  little.  You  don't  have  to  do  it.   There  are  some  coins  where  uh  that's   more  clear.  For  example,  on  with  Solana,   you  know,  on  a  big  big  time  frame,  it   has  quite  a  juicy  drop  if  it  continues.   We've  been  covering  it  in  our  normal   streams  as  well,  but  this  drop  is  quite   big.  I  mean  Zana  could  easily  come  here   to  30.  That's  a  70%  fall  with  leverage.   I  mean  some  millionaires  will  be  minted   here.  Okay.  Um  is  it  guaranteed?   Nothing's  guaranteed.  That's  why   stop-loss  position  size  you  know  drill.   Then  if  we  look  at  let's  see  XRP  where   it  is  it  got  support  here  on  the  200WE   moving  average.  Uh  but  can  still  easily   I  mean  XRP  now  is  kind  of  in  the  middle   of  this  fall.  can  still  easily  go  to  200   week  like  this  minus  21  or  all  the  way   here  to  its  long-term  support  minus  50%.   And  again,  if  you  know  how  to  use   leverage,  way  more,  way  more.  So,  this   is  the  game  plan  currently  guys,  it  is   still  a  shorting.  If  you  are  an   accumulator,  you  don't  want  to  short,   you  just  want  to  accumulate,  then  sit  on   your  hands.  Just  sit  on  your  hands.  Now   is  not  the  time  for  you  to  uh  to  buy.  I   mean,  many  people  are  they're  thinking   in  terms  of,  you  know,  buy  now  is  not   the  time.  we're  not  in  the  buy  zone  and   even  if  we  get  sorry  even  if  we  get  into   the  buy  zone  it  will  still  take  a  bit  to   to  come  down  but  in  the  meanwhile  use   this  boring  time  uh  in  the  market  when   it  comes  to  big  coins  at  least  to  uh   learn  how  to  short  to  learn  how  to  do  uh   leverage  trading  go  to   bullmay.com/partners   to  use  the  exchanges  that  I  use  you  find   the  link  below  in  the  description  click   it  right  now  as  soon  as  possible  and  um   yeah  BBIT  is  the  most  trusted  I  would   say  because  I've  been  using  it  since   2019.  Uh  they  have  going  long  going   short.  They  have  stocks  as  well  and  the   bank  account  is  coming  soon.  You  can   literally  have  a  bank  account  inside   BBIT  in  your  own  name.  Uh  fantastic.  But   it's  coming  soon.  Then  you  have  Pionex   by  Weeks,  Bit  Ununix.  These  ones  have   less  KYC  if  you  want  to  do  that.  Uh  so   that's  that's  your  CTA  right  now  to  use   this  opportunity  to  get  them  set  up  with   exchanges  when  it's  a  bit  boring.  Let's   check  the  the  bull  flips.  There  are   still  some  coins  that  do  fantastically   well.  This  one,  let's  see,  I  guess  it's   a  it's  a  new  coin.  That's  why  it's  it   shows  like  Yeah,  this  coin  doesn't  have   any  trend.  So,  you  you  also  have  a  a  few   bullish  um  cases  that  you  can  see  those   that  bullish  just  a  few  days  ago.  U  the   problem  with  them  guys  is  that  they  are   working  against  gravity.  So,  you  can   still  long  them.  You  can  still  try   longing  them,  but  it  it's  going  to  be   tougher.  uh  midnight  here  uh  all  of  the   Cardano  fans  is  just  uh  has  justly   bullish  uh  you  could  you  could  speculate   that  potentially  goes  to  this  resistance   right  here  you  can  long  it  50%  gain  here   could  easily  happen  uh  for  midnight  but   overall  it  they  are  working  against   gravity  the  gravity  now  is  pulling   pulling  pulling  us  down  so  guys  that's   it  for  Friday  uh  update  I  thought  I   would  do  like  this  because  when  it  comes   to  news  when  it  comes  to  big  picture   it's  kind  of  the  same  story  so  Let  me   know  if  you  appreciate  this,  you  know,   rapidfire  bum  bum  bum  bum  bum  trading   setups  to  trade.
