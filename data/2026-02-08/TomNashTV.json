        "transcript": "If you have Palanteer, Nvidia, Tesla, or any of the other tech names in your portfolio, what I'm going to show in today's video might have a massive impact on your portfolio. In fact, it will make or break your returns, your future, your ability to create generational wealth. So, you better listen. So, don't click nothing, don't smash nothing, don't buy nothing, just listen. Now, my name is Tom Nash. I used to be a senior financial analyst. Now I'm on YouTube breaking down the real path to generational wealth without all this hopeand that you're hearing on mainstream media on social media and all this stuff. Now over the past few days you have gotten a microcosm of what the stock market is. It is a voting machine in the short term. Pay attention to what happened to the sentiment of the past few days alone on Tuesday and Wednesday when everything was selling off. Sentiment was in the toilet. Every single person on YouTube, on X, on mainstream media, everybody talking about how bad things are. All of a sudden, valuations matter. All of a sudden, we have rotation. Microeconomic fears, AI is eating software. Everything erupts the minute prices drop for a few days, not even a few weeks, just two days. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and then everything went to crisis mode. People lost their minds. Now, Friday comes along and it's green. All of a sudden, we're back. Every single YouTuber, social media influencer, everybody's talking great things are. We're back. It's been a good ride. Woo! Power to you for holding on. You're patting people on the back for holding on for 48 hours. Is this where we at right now? All of a sudden, the sentiment is great. All of this happened, folks. All of this happened in a span of 72 hours. Now, 72 hours in the stock market is literally a heartbeat. It's not even a blip on the radar. This is not even a bug in the windshield. What happened over the past 72 hours is primo example to you why what I'm going to explain today's video is super important. Now, I don't want to be the potty pooper here, and I don't intend to be one, but let me just clarify something super important, which is Friday and the green you saw on Friday does not necessarily mean we're out of the woods. It does not mean that the sell-off that you've seen last week is over. It means that Friday was a green day. It means Thursday and Wednesday were red days. It is literally a tossup. And every single day, the percentage of green days and red days is literally 5446 in favor of green. It's literally statistically impossible to infer anything about the stock market from the fact that Friday was green. In fact, I'm going to say something else. If you're going to let short-term pricing impact your long-term strategy, you're going to destroy your investing portfolio. You're going to destroy your future. Your family is counting you. You have a fiduciary duty to the people who love you. Do not be a dumbass. If you're going to let short-term pricing impact your mood, your sentiment, and your decision making for your long-term portfolio, that means you're about to get wrecked. And I'm going to make sure I'll do anything in my power to prevent that from happening. And you being here is step one in the path to salvation and to solution. Okay. Now, if you're going to allow this sort of thing, price swings in the short term fill in your mind and get this emotions inside your strategy inside your brain. You're not going to be able to stop it from impacting your decision-m. It's like poison. You cannot drink poison and just say, \"Well, I'm not going to let it get to me. I'm just going to watch this doomsday stuff, but I'm still holding on strong.\" No, this is poison. If you're gonna be price watching on the daily, which is very popular right now, you're gonna be destroying your portfolio. You're gonna be destroying your strategy. Not a good idea. Now, hang on with me here because this about to get interesting. Now, right now, we have non-stop chatter about the so-called AI bubble. The AI bubble of 2026. Michael Bur is out there. every single expert out there. Michael Bur is already predicting another crash. You know, he predicted, you know, 17, nonetheless, zero crashes. No hate to Michael Bur, but I'm just saying there's a lot of talk, a lot of chattering now about this being the replay of the dot crash of the late 90s, early 2000s. And everybody's saying, well, it's over. This time it's different, Tom. This time it's the big one. This time it's real. Now, if you pull up any S&P 500 on NASDAQ chart and you just zoom out, you'll find out that up to date, no matter how long you're going to check, it has never been different. We have never had at this time it's different event since the S&P 500 exists since 1957. We had pullbacks, we had drops, we had crashes, but it has never been different because as long as you stayed in the market, you've made money, including the last decade. If you just stayed in the market from the dotcom crash and all the way through the last decade and you exited right on the COVID crash, you still made 400%. It's insane to think about how simple this is and yet how difficult it is for people to grasp this idea. And I'm not discounting people's brain power. I'm not discounting your intellect. It's not about intelligence. It's about understanding that the system works in a way that's very painful in real time, but very beneficial in the long term. This is literally like going to the gym. Now, I've recently lost about 35 pounds. The one thing that journeying taught me is that the results in the short term, they don't come. You look in the mirror, you see the same person. Nothing is happening. You go every day to the gym. It's painful. It's unpleasant. You're not doing that great. You're sweating. You're tired. And then in the short term, you're like, \"Well, I should have stayed home and watched TV, eat some etc., etc. It would have been much more fun than going to the gym.\" But then a year goes by, two years go by, you don't recognize your body, you're a completely different person. The same thing in the stock market. Short-term volatility feels very unpleasant. But in the long term, it is an opportunity to make money. I'm going to give you an example just from last year. Last year, we had two major sell-off scares. The deepse scare and the terror scare in January and in April of 2025. big events. This time it's different. It's over. Just to remind you, DeepSeek was supposed to disrupt large language models. Tariffs were supposed to end the US economy. And these two events basically brought on a major sale, a major major carnage event, a lot worse than what you've seen for the past two days, which is surprising to me that people still don't get it. Now, this was unpleasant. But now it's been a year, not even a year by the way, since April. And you look back and you're saying, \"Oh my goodness, we literally have made a lot of money since the S&P 500 since that point is up 20%.\" So if you just held on here, you are up 20% from this point, from this selloff. And that if that doesn't show you that every single crazy pullback rumor, new thing that changes everything every time, it's an opportunity to make money as long as you have the patience. And that's just in the year. Now look, the S&P 500 pulls back 5%, which by the way is not that uncommon. It happens three, four times a year. And when the S&P drops 5%, stocks like Palunteer and Tesla drop 20 25%. That happens three times per year. Once per year, we have a 10% drop, which may seem like a 30, 35, 40% drop in stocks like Palunteer and Tesla. Again, Palunteer here in February drop 40%. And again, this happens. It's normal. It's part of the process. And every couple of years, we have a 15% drop or a bare market. And that is total carnage, way worse than what you've seen, for example, in 2022. And again, all of this doesn't play any role in the long term. The only three numbers you need to remember are these. 5475 95. What do I mean by that? 54% of days in the stock market are green. Well, so if you want to pick a day, it's pretty much, you know, crapshoot. But because we have this 4% edge, it's like in the casino. That 4% edge when you do it again and again and again and again and again every single day becomes a 75% chance of green. If you look at an annual basis 75% of years in the stock market are green. And if you go and you look at decades you find out that 95% of decades are green. So, if you know that your chances at beating the market or beating other market players in the trading game is 54% on the daily, it's 75% on the annual and 95% chances of winning as long just hold on for 10 years. Why would you not want to cheat and get this cheat code? Why would you want to play a game when you have a 4% edge where here you have a 95% edge? It is insane to me that people refuse to play the easy mode and they want to play an expert mode where the computer is actually cheating against you. You still want to be here trading when it's super easy to just make money by holding on. You really don't need to do more than that. Now, is there an actual bubble? Because at this point, it has become a serious enough conversation for me to address this. And I shouldn't have, but you know, the chatter is absolutely out of control. So, I have to bring it back to Earth. Now I don't know if there is a bubble or there isn't a bubble. All I am is about science, about data, about statistics and about objective definitions. Now our definition of a bubble and it has been the definition for many many years. This is the definition. Three conditions must happen for a bubble to be defined as a bubble. Just like we have a definition for recession, just like we have a definition of a bare market. This is ladies and gentlemen the definition of a bubble. Three conditions must all happen for this to be a bubble. You have to have a five-year return of 50% or more on that particular asset class. You have to have a two-year return of about 100% for the same asset class. And for the past two years, you must outperform the S&P 500 by 100%. So basically, you must be up 100% over two years and you must beat the S&P 500 by 100% or more. Now, this is a very tall order, but believe it or not, in the dotcom crash in 2000, we literally hit this definition just like in every other bubble in existence globally. All we have to do here is just take a look at the NASDAQ, which represents the vast majority of these so-called tech stocks, AI names, and whatnot. Now, for the past two years, the NASDAQ is up 45%. Which is well below the 100% threshold. So, that condition doesn't meet. But also, for the past two years, the NASDAQ only beat the S&P by 5%. Which means it's not overperforming the market by 100%. Not even close. So, based on the actual definition of a bubble, we don't have a bubble. There is no bubble according to definition. But now, I'm going to infuse my two cents into this. I'm going to share with you what I think because there is something to be said about these definitions not being the most accurate of all measures to measure a bubble. But here's the thing, and you can debate this in the comments if you think I'm wrong. Let's put it to the side. Earnings growth exists right now with AI. Certainly, every single AI company is growing earnings like crazy. Check. Okay. Do we have a lot of debt, a lot of leverage being taken on by these companies to finance this bubble like in the dotcom crash? No. It is self- financed. No debt is being taken. It is being funded by cash flow from the same companies. Okay? Do we have major productivity gains in the real world from this? Or is it just pets.com No. The world is literally changing the way we do production, supplies, logistics, hospitality, food and beverage, you name the industry. It has shifted dramatically since the introduction of AI. Okay? Do we have junk IPO frenzy like we had in every single bubble with everything.com for example? Of course not. Okay. We now have agentic workflows which means it's no longer just about Chad GPT helping you cheat on your exams. Agentic for flows change the way people work. Startups no longer hire junior developers. It's all done with cloud and agents. It is insane. Okay. We also have a broad base which hasn't really adopted AI yet. Massive total addressable market by the oil industry. And we have massive massive insanely fast cash flow monetization cycles from AI. And I love the argument of alh how this is the snake eating its own tail. It's the hyperscalers spending money to spend more money. Look across the board at the money generation coming not just from the capex from the actual customers from the B2B from the B2C. It's complete The claim that this is somehow a circular spending fake fugazi doesn't align with the real world. Now, let me just show you what happens to people who simply follow one rule, which is hold on to dear life and don't get spooked by the declines. So, since April 2025, it's been almost a year, we're up 20%. You remember that drop, by the way, April 2020, remember when the world was ending because of COVID, we're up 80% since that point. By the way, since April 2015, 10 years ago or so, we're up 270%. the cruel plot twist of investing and unfortunately I hate this to be the case but it is what it is. Okay. The only real protection you will have from inflation for your hard-earned money the money you worked very hard to make the only protection you will ever have from inflation eating 45% of its purchasing power in about 5 10 years. The only protection you're going to have is by investing. Okay. But the only way to do this is to endure short-term pain. So it's kind of tragic that the only protection for inflation that you have involves with massive shortterm pain because the market isn't linear. It is going to do crazy insane stuff that are going to be very painful in the short term. You're going to look like an idiot. You're going to feel like a But this is how you protect money against inflation. Again, if you just sat in cash for 10 years, half of your spending power is gone. If for the same 10 years you were in the S&P 500, your inflation adjusted returns would have been about 350%. And without it, just nominally like 600%. It is insanely silly not to be invested despite the short-term volatility. Now, look, it feels horrible. It sucks. It's it's not easy. And that's why most people fail at this game. Not because it's complicated. It is super easy, but it's not easy to execute. It's easy to understand, but when it comes to implementation, most people can't do it. That's why most people lose money in the stock market because of here and here. This is where this problem starts. Now, every time in history, time in the market plus great companies or a broad market index like the S&P 500 equals lots of money. Despite the volatility, despite the last decade, despite this time, it's different. Always, always, always, there will be a reason to sell. There will be a new scare, a new panic. And yet, every time it's not different. It's never different. Now, I've got a guide on how to panic proof your entire investing system right now. The guide is below. It is absolutely for free.
