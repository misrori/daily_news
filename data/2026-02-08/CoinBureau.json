        "transcript": "Recently, over 3 million more pages of the Epstein files were released to the public. While much of the shocking content was expected, what caught many offguard was that some of the files mentioned Bitcoin, and this has sparked countless headlines across crypto news outlets and sent social media into a frenzy. There's been a wave of viral posts on X and Reddit making all kinds of claims, some more credible than others. Some say that Epstein spoke with Bitcoin's creators. Others point to him telling people not to buy BTC, and a few even speculate that Epstein was Satoshi Nakamoto all along. That's why today we're diving deep into the files to see exactly what they say about Bitcoin and what it could all mean for crypto's future. My name is Guy and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Now, given the sensitive nature of today's subject matter, I need to make a few things absolutely clear. First, I'm not a financial adviser and nothing in this video should be considered financial investment or legal advice. This video is for educational purposes only and it's intended to inform you about the links between crypto and the Epstein files. Second, we are not here to discuss Jeffrey Epstein himself, nor are we here to discuss any of his crimes. If you made it this far into the video, then you probably already know something about them already. But if not, well, feel free to Google them on your own time. Be warned, though, it's not pretty. And third, we are not here to make accusations about any individuals or groups that may or may not have been associated with Epstein. Again, feel free to connect those dots on your own. This is a crypto channel, folks, and today we're focusing purely on the crypto aspect of this story. So, with that long disclaimer out of the way, let's get to it. Now, as you'll no doubt know, people everywhere have been pushing for the Epstein files to be made public for years. These files date back to the early '9s and contain all the evidence gathered by US law enforcement during their investigation into Epstein's revoling crimes. This evidence includes court filings, legal records, email conversations, flight logs, images, videos, interview notes, and everything in between. essentially anything with a paper trail. Now, it wasn't until the 18th of November 2025 that the US government passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act, requiring the Department of Justice or DOJ to release all the files to the public. Then, on the 19th of December 2025, the DOJ released its first batch of Epstein files, but the release drew bipartisan criticism. Not only was the number of files released small compared to the total number supposedly collected, but they were also heavily redacted, revealing very little information. Some pages were completely blacked out, literally showing nothing at all. However, far more information was made public on the 30th of January this year when the DOJ released over 3 million pages of additional Epstein related files. For context, the DOJ had previously stated there were around 6 million pages in total, but insisted that it had met its legal obligations and that this latest release would be the final one. Food for thought. In any case, this batch of Epstein files revealed all kinds of wild details, most of which you've probably seen plastered across the news and social media already. And if you're in crypto, you'll know that these emails contained many mentions of Bitcoin and indeed crypto more broadly. This has everyone in the industry asking questions they never thought they'd need to ask. Did Epstein help fund Bitcoin's early development? Which key crypto personalities visited the island? Did Epstein know Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity? Or was Satoshi actually Jeffrey Epstein all along? And it's worth repeating that Epstein's ties to crypto aren't limited to Bitcoin. The files also reveal potential links to other crypto projects and a handful of crypto companies. Don't worry, though, we'll dive back into all of this later on. Needless to say, though, crypto Twitter has been busy losing what's left of its collective mind over all this, and it's easy to see why. It's also worth pointing out that people are still combing through the released files trying to connect the dots on Epstein's crypto links. So, we can probably expect more details to emerge, especially if the DOJ releases the remaining Epstein files. Though, let's face it, that seems unlikely. But, if you're looking to keep up with these developments in real time, then why not join the Coin Bureau's Telegram channel?

So, sign up today using the link in the description or the QR code on screen now. All right, then. Now that you've got a rough idea of what's been going on, let's take our first step down the rabbit hole, starting with Jeffrey Epstein's connections to Bitcoin. One of the most surreal revelations in the files is just how early Epstein was aware of Bitcoin. For instance, one file shows a September 2012 email from Epstein saying, quote, \"The Bitcoin guys said they didn't mind having to go to jail. Sorry, not me.\" Well, that age like milk, huh? Anyways, what's crazy is that Epstein contacted early Bitcoin developer Gavin Anderson in June 2011, requesting a phone call just 2 days before Anderson infamously visited the CIA headquarters to discuss Bitcoin. What's crazy is that this all happened just weeks after Satoshi had stepped back, handpicking Anderson as his successor. Now, the trail here seems to go cold, but it does suggest that intelligence agencies could have been involved with Bitcoin even from the start. Regardless, in 2013, Epstein was forwarded an email that simply read, quote, \"You might like this.\" The attached email had originally been sent to a group of wealthy tech figures, including Bill Gates, the world's second richest person at the time. It contained an analysis of Bitcoin and its future potential. Basically, the email described BTC as having no intrinsic value driven solely by speculation. However, it also included quotes from various investors with many showing excitement about Bitcoin's potential to disrupt the legacy finance system. Safe to say Epstein seems to have been a speculator. That's because the files revealed that in 2015, Epstein helped MIT Media Lab director Joichi Itito fund MIT's digital currency initiative or DCI. This is significant because at the time the DCI was a major funding source for Bitcoin's primary development team, Bitcoin Core. What's crazy is that Itto emailed Epstein explaining that at the time the Bitcoin core team consisted of five core developers including Gavin Anderson, Vladimir Vandelan, and Cory Fields plus around 100 additional contributors. Itto outlined how the Bitcoin Core team was being paid by the nonprofit Bitcoin Foundation. However, in 2015, a newly elected board member said the foundation was effectively bankrupt and subsequent statements from Anderson and others confirmed it was under severe financial stress. So MIT's Media Lab quickly stepped in and those three core developers joined the Media Lab team. Itto described this as quote a big win for us. Now, here is where things get spicy. MIT had previously claimed that Epstein donated a total of $850,000 to the research facility with $525,000 going to the media lab. However, in 2019, an investigative journalist alleged that Epstein and his associates had actually contributed much more, as much as 7.5 million. Whatever the amount, the key takeaway is though that some of the MIT Media Lab gift funds linked to Epstein were used to support the DCI, which paid the salaries of several Bitcoin core developers. This means that Epstein's money indirectly helped fund Bitcoin's development for years. That said, though, it's extremely important to note that investment in Bitcoin core does not mean controlling Bitcoin in any way. More importantly, there's no evidence that Epstein influenced the team's technical roadmap or governance, and he does not appear to have steered Bitcoin's direction in any visible way. It's also important to note that Epstein wasn't always a strong believer in Bitcoin's potential. As is the case with speculators, his interest in Bitcoin fluctuated over the years. For instance, in 2014, he had an email exchange with billionaire investor Peter Teal. In that email, Epstein wrote that quote, \"There is little agreement on what Bitcoin is, store of or intrinsic value, currency, property, architecture, payment system, etc. Conflicting goals, anonymous but transparent.\" Before making a bizarre comparison to gender identity. After BTC's price surged in 2017, Epstein was asked directly if Bitcoin was still worth buying. He replied with one word, no. Now, keep in mind at the peak of the 2017 bull market, BTC didn't even top $20,000. Not financial advice, but there's probably a lesson in there somewhere. Right now, as you can imagine, social media was set ablaze after this was all discovered, creating the perfect environment for trolls to spread fake news and add even more to the chaos. One of the wildest rumors to go viral is the obviously false theory that Jeffrey Epstein was actually Satoshi Nakamoto. This rumor was sparked by an image that went viral, apparently showing a 2008 email from Epstein to now convicted partner in crime, Gileain Maxwell. The fake email reads, quote, Galain, the Satoshi pseudonym is working perfectly. Our little digital gold mine is ready for the world. Funding secured, Jeffrey. The post has millions of views, thousands of likes, and hundreds of retweets. And to be fair, it's easy to see why. At first glance, it looks like a legit email. On closer inspection, though, you'll notice that it has two two lines where one should be the subject line instead. And if you search the Epstein files on the DOJ's website, you'll find no such email exists. People really will do anything for likes these days. That said though, Epstein did claim to have contacted Satoshi Nakamoto. In 2016, he emailed two Saudi contacts proposing two ideas, a digital currency for the Middle East, likely a stable coin, and a Sharia compliant crypto based on Bitcoin. He then claimed to have quote spoken to some of the founders of Bitcoin, who were apparently very excited about the idea. Sure. To be clear, these emails don't prove that Epstein actually spoke with Satoshi or that he knew Satoshi's true identity. However, they do show that Epstein knew enough about Bitcoin's infrastructure to propose replicating and modifying it, either making it compliant with religious laws or making it a usable alternative monetary system. In any case, this raises the question, does it bring us closer to uncovering Satoshi's true identity? The short answer is yes and no. If Epstein did have contact with Satoshi like he claims, the fact that he referred to Bitcoin's founders plural suggests that Satoshi may actually be more than one person. Assuming that's true, which seems unlikely, then this aligns with years of speculation that Bitcoin was too complex for a single mind to come up with. Not to mention, the Bitcoin white paper repeatedly uses we instead of I. So, who could the real person or people be? Well, as you probably know, people have been guessing at Satoshi's identity for well over a decade, and numerous names have been tossed into the mix along the way. To bring you up to speed, here are some of the strongest contenders. The first is Hal Finny, who was involved in Bitcoin before it even launched and was even the first person to ever receive a Bitcoin transaction. Another contender is Nick Sabo, an OG cipher punk who suggested a digital peer-to-peer currency called Bit Gold in 2005. Another is Adam Back, who created Hashe, which Bitcoin's proof of work is based on. Back is even mentioned by Satoshi in the Bitcoin white paper. And there's also Len Sasserman, a cipher punk cryptographer with an interest in privacy tech, who sadly passed away in 2011, shortly after Satoshi stepped away from Bitcoin. And there are also theories that Satoshi was British based on British spellings he used in his writings and the fact that a headline from the Times, a UK newspaper, was engraved in the Genesis block, the first block ever mined on the Bitcoin blockchain. However, all of these are speculative guesses, each with their own evidence to suggest that they're not actually Satoshi. So, for now, the true identity of Bitcoin's creator remains a mystery, but we can be sure it wasn't Jeffrey Epstein. Now, something else that's been brought to light in the Epstein files is the various investments he made in different crypto companies. But before we get into those, I'll reiterate what I mentioned earlier. We're not here to pass judgment on anyone who interacted with Epstein in any way. In other words, any names mentioned from here on shouldn't be taken as accusations of any wrongdoing. All we're focusing on are the documented facts surrounding these investments and deals. With that in mind, one of the most talked about investments from the Epstein files involves Blockstream. As it happens, Epstein participated in the $18 million oversubscribed seedand for Blockstream back in 2014. Specifically, Epstein made a personal investment of $50,000 through a fund linked to Joyito, who you'll recall was the director of the MIT Media Lab at the time. That fund took a small minority stake in Blockstream seed round, but not before Epstein's initial investment was bumped up to half a million instead of $50,000. Anyhow, this investment raised several eyebrows. And shortly after the latest batch of files were made public, Blockstream's CEO, the aforementioned Adam Back, took to X to make a statement. back basically confirmed Epstein's indirect involvement with Blockstream, but also added that quote, \"A few months later, Itto's fund divested its Blockstream shares due to a potential conflict of interest and other concerns.\" Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein or his estate. Meanwhile, another controversial detail that's come to light is that an Epstein related entity invested around $3 million in Coinbase in 2014, the same year as the Blockstream investment. This isn't too surprising though. Epstein was known for putting money into just about anything. Intriguingly though, the investment opportunity was actually presented to Epstein by Brock Pierce, a co-founder of both venture firm Blockchain Capital and USDT issuer Tether. Now, at the time of Epstein's 2014 investment, Coinbase was obviously much smaller than it is today, valued at just $400 million at the time. Epstein reportedly sold 50% of his stake in 2018 for $15 million, a very nice return on his initial investment. It's unclear if or when he sold the remaining 50%, but by then he'd already pocketed millions in gains. Now, when it comes to Epstein's connections to altcoins, there are a few worth highlighting. The first is his connection to Zcash, a leading privacy coin. In 2018, Epstein received an email from Madars Verza, a research scientist who had worked with Joyito at the MIT Media Lab. In a nutshell, Viza wrote that Zcash was about to fork. He noted that all his coins were still held by the company and suggested they consider withdrawing their allocation to potentially benefit from both forks. The second and third altcoins Epstein had connections to are Ripple and Stellar. In a July 2014 email titled Stellar isn't so stellar, Blockstream co-founder Austin Hill told Epstein that Blockstream was unhappy about his investments in both Ripple and Stellar. In his words, quote, \"Ripple and Jed's new Stellar are bad for the ecosystem we are building, and it does our company damage to have investors who are backing two horses in the same race.\" Hill even added a warning, saying he'd been asked by other co-founders to quote, \"Reduce or take your allocation away.\" Now, at this point, you might be thinking that Ethereum probably also has connections to Epstein, given how it exploded onto the scene in 2015, right when Epstein appears to have been pretty active in the crypto space. However, ETH holders out there will be relieved to know that Ethereum is barely mentioned at all in the Epstein files. Although something that's truly fascinating is that Masha Draova, a Russian-born investor and US-based VC, wrote to Epstein in 2017 claiming to have found a young blockchain developer in Russia who quote could become better than Vitalic Buterin if he focused on technology and offered to connect the two. This makes you wonder whether Vitalik himself was contacted first but refused to be trapped, prompting Draova to try and find a Vitalik 2.0. go. But this is purely speculation and it's not clear if an alternative Vitalik was ever contacted. Still, it's good to know that Vitalik himself was never captured. Okay, so with everything we've covered today, you might be asking yourself at this point whether Bitcoin has been compromised in some way. Well, the short answer is no. Despite all the FUD circulating on social media, news flash, Bitcoin doesn't have a senior management position, and even if Epstein had financial involvement with Bitcoin Core, suggesting he influenced its code simply isn't true. Moreover, Bitcoin Core commits surged post 2015 due to debates around scaling, SegWit, and the Lightning Network. So, all of those GitHub commits were related to things that had no impact on Bitcoin's core ethos, pun intended. Still, all this Epstein talk does raise questions about Bitcoin's image, and honestly, it is a bit of a setback. Even if Bitcoin itself wasn't affected directly, the fact that it's mentioned in the Epstein files isn't exactly flattering. And let's face it, crypto has a bad enough image problem as it is. However, there is an important silver lining to this. Despite all the disgusting activity detailed in the Epstein files, there's no evidence that crypto was used to finance any of it. This may surprise some given Bitcoin's past ties to criminal activity. But thankfully, crypto isn't cast as a villain here, which, well, makes a change. This matters more than you might think because it means the investors paying the closest attention like institutions likely haven't had their perception of Bitcoin shaken by these events. If anything, this arguably strengthens Bitcoin's case. After all, if Bitcoin has survived the collapse of major exchanges like Mount Gaus and FTX, internal debates like the Block size wars, and monsters like Jeffrey Epstein, then a few regulatory changes in 2026 and beyond will be a walk in the park by comparison. Institutions are forward-looking. Once the Epstein dust settles, those decades old emails will barely register. Although, if more files are released in the future, we could see new information emerge. information that could potentially make things more challenging for the crypto industry. So fingers crossed, we've already seen the worst because all things considered, crypto hasn't come off too badly from all of this. Even if some key players in crypto have been implicated in the files in some way. Still, it's reassuring to know that even as we enter a bare market, it's not because of any cryptospecific failures. So, take comfort in knowing that Bitcoin will still be around in the future, stronger than ever and ready to rally to new all-time highs in the next bull market. Until then, though, we're probably going to see some crazy downside. So, strap in, folks, because it's going to be a bumpy ride. All right, that's all from me for today. If you want to see how institutions really feel about crypto in 2026, then check out the video right over here. And if you want to see what challenges Bitcoin could face in the year ahead, check out the video right over here. Okay, thank you all for watching and I'll see you again soon. This is Guy signing off."
