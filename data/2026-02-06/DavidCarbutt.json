        "transcript": "Okay, let's dive in. In clip one today, Dan Levy from Barclays breaks down why Tesla's robo taxi business comes down to one simple thing, cost. Then in clip two, we're looking at OpenAI's massive funding round and what it means that Microsoft is no longer the primary beneficiary of OpenAI success because their biggest cloud rival, Amazon, might be getting a stake. And then finally, we've got a bonus clip from Kathy Wood, who shares some big insights about how robo taxis can change the world economy forever. Let's get cracking. >> How do you though value or or how are you even thinking right now about a the prospect for the robo taxi and what you think that business ultimately looks like on one end. We can start there and then after that we should probably get into the Optimus robot story because that is the next real leg of this story. Yeah. So, right now the focus on uh Robo Taxi is going to be on making sure that they can have scaled commercialization. Really, that's the focus this year. They pulled the driver from Austin. And so, we want to see a you know, how much more widely they can expand the OD uh the number of cars and really start to take share and see whether this is a service that can really compete against uh a Whimo. and they do this in other locations, right? That's going to be the focus this year. And you can start to sketch out, you know, if they can get this done and they have a cost advantage, how this is going to unlock revenue. The humanoid robots is much more difficult because that's still really in an R&D and prototype phase. As Elon said, they're going to start production of the uh Gen 3 version later this year, but we still have to see, you know, really how they unlock that. That one is much more of a show me story. Uh but you can see where the TAM is quite large on that. >> In terms of the taxi piece, obviously we've seen the success of Whimo. They've gotten uh to some scale. How how scaled up do you think the robo taxi will ultimately be? You know, there's always been this question about liar and the like and sort of the the idea that they don't I mean the Tesla doesn't use LiDAR. Does it matter? Has he proved his point? Meaning, has Elon proved the point that you don't need lidar? >> Well, I think that's still getting proven, right? The the reality is is that yes, we've seen Tesla pull the driver. It's on a limited basis, though. If you compare this to where where is right now in uh one of the many any of the many cities where they are operating and they're now fully driverless in I believe it's it's three or four cities, right? Whimo clearly has proven they can pull the driver. So Tesla still has to prove that more widely, but the opportunity for Tesla is going to be on the cost side because remember each Whimo costs something along the lines of hundred to $150,000 per vehicle. The beauty of a cyber cab is that could be $30,000 or less. And so once you unlock uh that driverless capabilities and I think we're still seeing that you know liar versus no liar debate play out but if Elon can fully prove that this can be done on vision only you know and he can get some of the other commercialization pieces there is a significant cost advantage and that's why I think the market is treating Tesla as probably the only other competitor to Whimo here. And then and then finally, Dan, when you think about the robot piece of it, you know, what is the what is the timeline and what is the honeymoon? Uh when I say honeymoon, how much extra time the the sort of Elon Musk advantage, the Elon Musk honeymoon, which is to say, you know, he can give us a he can give us a timeline, but the market is also typically willing to give him extra time. And so what what's what's your timeline look like? And what how does that matter? Well, that that honeymoon phase right now uh at least as as to what the market is saying is quite quite long. The reality is is that you know we're only going to see initial production of what's more of a uh a closer to uh production version later this this year, right? As opposed to the prototype version that that we've had. So this is still very much in uh improving the concept phase. I think what the market really is focused on though is is the TAN capabilities. We just point out you went to CES a few weeks ago. Uh there are any number of other Chinese players that have humanoid robots. You have uh Boston Dynamics. Tesla obviously does have an AI advantage. She's talking about some of the the opportunities or the advantages on supply chain hand design and is actually a really tricky part of this. They've got the battery piece, right? That's why I think Tesla is being given uh a significant benefit here from from the market's perspective. >> Tesla's cost advantage in robo taxi is structural and permanent. They can put a vehicle on the road for a fifth of what it costs Whimo. So Dan's making a point that sounds simple but actually has massive implications. Each Whimo costs somewhere between $100 and $150,000 to put on the road. They don't make the vehicles themselves. They have to buy them from another company and that company takes a profit. Then Whimo has to outfit them with LAR, radar, and all these sensors. Cybercap, Tesla can probably build those for anywhere between 20 and $30,000. So that's a 5x cost difference before you even turn the car on. And this matters for how you actually run a robo taxi business. If you're Whimo and you want to meet peak demand, rush hour, people leaving bars at 2 a.m. big events, you need a massive fleet of idle vehicles sitting around doing nothing for almost all the time. That's terrible capital allocation. Tesla can afford to flood a city with cyber cabs because the cost of having one sit there waiting is almost nothing compared to what Whimo pays. Higher utilization, lower costs, better margins. The math just works differently. The LAR versus vision debate is still playing out. And I think Dan's right that Tesla still has to prove this works more broadly. But I do think they are pretty much there. Whimo is operating fully driverless in three or four cities now, but Tesla has that scalability advantage, which I think they're on the cusp of really ramping into. And that's because Tesla has just pulled the driver in Austin on a limited basis. But the thing is, even if we assume both systems achieve comparable safety and comparable weight times, meaning the service itself is identical from a customer's perspective, the cost structure still favors Tesla by a massive margin. You can't innovate your way out of paying five times more for your hardware. Plus, there's the fleet scaling problem. If Whimo had unlimited capital, trillions of dollars to spend, they still couldn't scale as quickly as Tesla because they don't make the cars. Tesla's pumping out just shy of 2 million vehicles per year. And here's another point. Tesla can supplement their own fleet with customerowned vehicles during peak demand. Just send a notification to every Tesla owner. Hey, we need more cars. You'll make 100 bucks today. Press yes and your car joins the fleet. Whimo can never replicate that. Where would they even start? If you want to understand how AI like FSD actually learns and improves, I've got a course called the AI landscape that breaks down all this kind of stuff. by today using the link in the description and you get lifetime access and the prices go up as we add new modules. So Tesla has this structural cost advantage in physical AI with robo taxis. But in the pure software AI race, the dynamics are shifting in a really interesting way. This open AI funding round tells us something important about how the AI landscape is reshaping itself. We've got some of the biggest players in tech betting that Open AI can reclaim the lead after months of sliding down the benchmarks. But the Microsoft relationship has gotten complicated and that changes the investment thesis for a lot of companies in this space. >> So the money lining up behind OpenAI, it tells you something. Some of the biggest players in tech, they're betting that OpenAI can take back the narrative of the next model cycle. An OpenAI comeback after Code Red, months of sliding down the technical benchmarks, rising pressure from Google's Gemini. Now its next model, GBT6, it's expected in the second quarter. And this is key. It's being trained on Nvidia Blackwell chips. That matters because Blackwell is supposed to change what's possible at the very top of model training. And just like we saw Gemini 3 flip the narrative and the investment thesis, that could plausibly happen again, but this time in the open AI univers's favor. So you're looking at these sort of different universes right here. The open AI one is Oracle, AMD, Microsoft, Nvidia, Coreweee, SoftBank. The infrastructure that's exposed to Open AI. It suddenly has a very different setup if GPT6 does reset the benchmark race. For Microsoft though, the relationship has become more complicated. It is no longer the primary financial or strategic beneficiary of OpenAI success. Its biggest cloud rival Amazon may be getting a stake through this new funding round according to that reporting. And Microsoft itself is already diversifying by giving customers more choice over which models they use and making an investment in Anthropic. By the way, OpenAI's rival. Now, you also heard some defensiveness on the earnings call last night. Amy Hood pointing out to analysts the mix of backlog as a glass half full. 55% Microsoft, 45% tied to open AI. Now, for big tech as a whole, the investors are looking for execution. And Microsoft may be losing the street an hour ago. Uh you guys were talking to Melius's Ben Reese's who has rated the stock a buy and he told you that Satia Nadell is playing catch-up to products like Anthropics Claude Co-work and they need to fix this narrative. So guys an open AI comeback if this does come to fruition change the investment thesis and the AI race as a whole but it won't be the same boost to Microsoft that it has been in the past. >> Microsoft is diversifying away from open AI. At the same time open AI is raising money from Microsoft's biggest competitors. that changes the entire investment map. So the funding round includes Oracle, AMD, Nvidia, Corewave, SoftBank, and according to the report, potentially Amazon. So think about that for a second. Amazon is Microsoft's biggest cloud competitor, and they might be getting a stake in the company Microsoft helped build. Meanwhile, Microsoft already has an investment in Anthropic, which is OpenAI's direct rival. Both sides are hedging their bets and the exclusive partnership that defined AI investing for the last two years is essentially over. GPT6 is expected in the second quarter trained on Nvidia's Blackwell chips and if it resets the benchmarks the way Gemini did, that changes the narrative again. But this is something which changes things. I think Microsoft isn't positioned to capture most of the upside anymore. Amy Herd pointed out on the earnings call that the backlog mix is now 55% Microsoft, 45% tied to OpenAI. That's a lot of exposure to a company Microsoft doesn't control and is actively diversifying away from. The other thing worth watching is OpenAI's actual business fundamentals. If you look at the numbers floating around, they're spending about $169 for every dollar they earn. The projections I've seen suggest they could be running at losses of tens of billions of dollars or more per year by 2028, as high as $40 billion. Compare that to Google, which is $34 billion in net profit last quarter alone. Open AAI doesn't have a sustainable business model that prints money. They have a product that requires constant fundraising to survive. It's a very different risk profile than investing in Microsoft or Google or Amazon, companies that are profitable despite their AI spending. And then there's the competitive pressure from multiple directions. Gemini has been eating into ChatG's market share went from about 8% to roughly 25% of the market. Claude from Anthropic keeps climbing the benchmarks. Microsoft is giving customers more choice which models they use. So even if GPT6 is great, OpenAI has to defend market share against wellunded competitors while burning billions of dollars. The question for investors is if they can build a sustainable business before the money runs out. Finally, let's see Kathy Wood and the members from the Moonshot podcast discuss the big impact that robo taxi might have on the global economy. This is a banger. >> You know, the one that came up with Elon, I don't know if you watched the whole Elon podcast, but I couldn't believe he told that story about the two economists walking through the woods and they pay each other to eat and it adds $200 to the global economy, but [laughter] nothing productive is created. And and that dubtales with Selen's law, you know, which is, hey, if if AI cures breast cancer, and millions and millions of people don't need radi, you know, radio um radiation or chemotherapy, that has the effect of looking like it reduces the GDP. In reality, if you wanted to, you could still go and hang out, you know, and not get the radiation and pay if you wanted to and then not have the cancer. And so it it adds huge net value to the world obviously, but it shows up as negative GDP. So the so the GDP metric is fundamentally broken in the age of AI. So maybe Kathy Wood's law fixes this. >> It it is. Um but there's there's another side to this. I I'm not going to say it's equal and opposite. Uh if you look at uh robotics and you look at the time we spend uh doing things for free, we're not paid to drive our children around. Uh we're not paid to make dinner and clean up afterwards. um we're going to unlock a lot of that and that will become paid in the form of we're going to be buying robots uh that will get into GDP and that never got into GDP for before. It's a little bit like uh what happened uh to the the farm economy here. The reason people at that time wanted to have lots and lots of children is they paid them room and board and and nothing else. Then we had the industrial revolution. Uh and of course their their work was not counted in GDP. Uh because there's GDP equals national income. National income is easier to measure in these days because of the tax system and so forth. And they have to equal they have to equal and so we will through robot uh um purchases uh see a lot of GDP coming back to us. >> That's a great point. So you take traditional things that aren't measured and you move them into the measured economy and that increases radically. Yes. Right. So this this reminds me of a specific data point. I remember talking to VCs who all many missed investing in Uber and I actually interviewed one of them and said why? And he said, \"We totally messed up because the taxi market in San Francisco is about 500 million a year.\" And we figured if Uber takes like 20% of that, that's just not a venture investment because then they only get some chunk of that revenue. What we missed was that the the ride sharing market quadrupled um and they took 80% market share from the taxis. So you ended up all these people taking rides that you never would dream would take rides, drunk people, etc., etc. And that totally changed the game. What's interesting about that is today Uber uh accounts for 1% of all urban miles traveled. This is in big ideas as well. Uh and we've done the analysis, talk about puts and takes here about uh GDP and so forth. We've done the analysis that uh to accommodate that 1% of urban miles traveled, it would take only 140,000 cars. Uh to to accommodate all urban miles traveled in the United States, this is um it would take 24 million cars. And when you put into context that uh the number of cars owned in the United States today is it's somewhere around 400 million and the number uh of autos sold every year in the United States is now roughly 15 million. That tells you the capacityization increase of the robo taxis is going to destroy the auto market as we know it. Most people pour money into ads people ignore. YouTube changes that. It builds trust, authority, and a real connection at scale. One law firm we worked with landed 33 clients in just 5 months worth $330,000 from their YouTube channel. If you run a business, this is one of the most overlooked opportunities right now. Book a call with me below and I can show you how we can make it"
