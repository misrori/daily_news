        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. And holy Toledo, the pain is still continuing across the street as the tech stocks and SAS stocks and crypto are looking to find a bottom, but they just cannot as the margin calls, the liquidations are continuing to roll in. Even though the S&P 500 was finally experiencing a little bit of selling pressure today, but isn't experiencing as much of a downtrend compared to some of these individual names. And that's what you can see some of these ETFs uh some of the hedges that they have within them in terms of the diversification of more energy utility stocks and things like that that can help bring some resiliency. But in terms of these individual assets, we're going to be talking about that especially with Palunteer as the technical breakdown here has been quite strong. Everybody's kind of waiting for the bottom as this week has been basically a blood bath. We're going to be talking about that, looking at where the current prices are of things and, you know, when do things start becoming really attractive because we're starting to see some names that are entering prices that we saw kind of like back in last summer. So, we'll be talking about that. If you are new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos. Let's pop it up in the channel here. Palanteer is currently at 129. Now, if you liked it at 170, you can get the same thing for basically about 130. I mean, it all depends on how you look at this. Yes, in the short term everybody is getting destroyed right now as we speak. Especially because look right here. Everybody was talking about this head and shoulders pattern for Palanteer and it got validated basically as that 150 got rejected kind of right at that 200 moving average and this is where you see the breakdown on Palunteer and Palanteer is currently at its last price that it was last June. Uh that's hanging out at that zone. So we'll see what happens. I mean, depending if this continues to break down, don't know where the bottom is. You know, we could have all these bottom callers out there, but anybody that's going to tell you where they think the true bottom is, I think they don't know what they're talking about cuz nobody knows what's going to be happening here. Um, Palanteer, though, comes down about another percent. For the people that are questioning, you know, how far will this fall? Uh, where are they looking to add in terms of their long-term perspective, that's with a lot of these high beta names right now, that's kind of what we can be expecting. But on terms of X and stuff and what you're seeing right here, a lot of people um talking about even here like 106 talking about an attractive level. So, we'll see what happens. Uh nonetheless, if we get any bounces there, we could have some short-term bounces, but like I said, be aware of that falling knife out there. Um especially a lot of these individual names and with a lot of these earnings, big MAG7 earnings, the moves are completely being faded. I mean just look at Palanteer after its earnings report got completely faded after one of the best earnings report that has been basically in the company's history. So this shows you nothing fundamentally is changing with Palanteer and with a lot of these companies not a ton of fundamental changes. It's more what the market's pricing them in right now. And I think a lot of this is starting to become a little over dramified. Uh we're starting to see a lot of very low RSIs, a lot of oversold territory. So possibly bounces in the near future we're going to be talking about here. Let's talk about some of the names first. Hood. Hood right here at $74. Now, this also had an interesting kind of breakdown where Hood is falling quite rapidly and is currently at the prices that we saw last June. So, we see here hood is well below its 200 moving average. A lot of this could be correlated to crypto's current move, which is also experiencing a lot of blood. If we see here, Bitcoin currently right now at 64,000 has had a little bit of a bounce cuz this dropped and tanked down to 60K. Quite crazy. And you see Ethereum here that is below 2,000. Those BMR holders that have been holding this whole time. Oh my gosh, the amount of community members out there. Uh, you know, I had BMR a long time ago and got out a long time ago and I'm glad that I did. Uh, but we'll see what happens. You know, BMR could be an interesting name once it does try to find its bottom here. once crypto finds its bottom. But we'll see what happens. Looking at some of these names that are really pulling back that we've been talking about on the channel, high beta names. You see Cipher right here at 1177 holding a little bit resiliency. It's still above its 200. Uh it's kind of trying to also find its bottom here. And this is after I ren's move after earnings got hit hard. Now with INE here, they missed their revenue by 19%. They just had re, you know, actually released a deal that they had, but miss revenue by 19%. Um, expected numbers right here at 226 million, that came in 184 million. So, even though revenue was up for 54% year-over-year, down 23% quarter over quarter. And you see this move that gets hit hard. So, a lot of these data center names are unfortunately following kind of some of the effect that they get from IEN. And you see Nbius coming down here even as 72. So, you know, Nebius, this could possibly get back into the 60s right here, depending on how these gaps kind of get filled in terms of what these moves are going to look like. You see Hood right here at 7392. Uh, you know, so when these names find a bottom, I like Robin Hood as a possible long-term potential here. However, though, you know, I'm not going to be adding with a ton of leverage right now because leverage during these times can be super super dangerous as you keep trying to catch that falling knife and just keep getting wiped out over and over again. That's how a lot of accounts can blow up. uh talking about agentic AI names that we'd like. Zetta right here also below its 200 at 1543 now. Now Zetta does have a decent amount of support right here at 15s, but if this gets failed too, I mean it's back to the 14s. It's back to the 13s for these stocks. So, you know, there's still room for these things to break down, they can still definitely fall. And you see even SoFi right here. So at 1907, very interesting to see here losing that $20 level of support that I was trying to hold at for quite some time. So, you know, the big question is, you know, what's happening with the general market? We see the overnight session that is still continuing to fall right here. SPY right now at 675 below its 50. You can see right here down about another 30 basis points in the overnight session. What we saw with the general S&P 500 index was down about 1.23%. We see today currently at 6,800. Now, 6,800 is a decent support level for the actual S&P 500. We'll see how it holds here at this level. We've seen a lot of dip buying at that 6,800. We'll see what happens in terms of resiliency. But this is what I'm talking about here. You know, the market actually does fully go red year to date. Uh we see it slightly red. Um talking about this, the Dow tumbles about 600 points and officially S&P goes negative for 2026. So, in terms of the AI buildout, let's talk about some of the big names in terms of the earnings reports from the MAG7 because that's what I like fundamentally behind the AI trade. Alphabet right here, uh, had the earnings report. We saw their name of course get, you know, these big M7s. Long story short, they're reporting these huge capital expenditures. You can see here for 2026, uh, they talk about 185 billion. And what we just got from Amazon today. Amazon stock drops 10% after 200 billion announcement for 2026 spending plan. Now they had recorded fourth quarter net sales up 14% beating estimates and revenue surging 24%. So these mag 7 earnings are actually doing quite well. That's what's keeping me bullish behind kind of the fundamentals. And right here, you know, with this quarter 4 reporting, you know, down 15% including the regular after, you know, regular move, these names I think are getting hit a little too hard. The big thing is here though with these names and these SAS stocks and especially these MAG7s, you know, with the capital expenditures, market really doesn't seem to care about that. It's being shot off. So, you know what? The big thing in terms of Google, in terms of these names, like I said, that are getting hit hard. The big question is, you know, unfortunately we don't have any headlines. Last year during liberation day type moves, that's, you know, where we had um the tariffs to point to and right now we don't really have any big headlines. Some of the speculation type of possible opinionated reasons for the move could be possibly the announcement of the new Fed. Um, as we do have, you know, he has more of a hawkish type of history with more quantitative tightening. Um and it can also be this whole kind of fear that for some reason uh AI and we see stuff with like cloud and anthropic and stuff is that going to take over SAS and is SAS going to be this highly disrupted type of uh sector and we've even seen Jensen and we saw Sundar from Google coming out and re repeating themselves that you know they don't think you know it's not like these software stocks and you know the actual softwares they're not going to be reinvented by AI that AI is most likely going to be embedded with imn and they're going to use these softwares as a tool. Um, he talked about, you know, as a robot using a screwdriver. It's not going to reinvent a screwdriver to utilize it. It's just going to use the current screwdriver. That's just the most simplest route. So, that's where I think this move could be kind of over just, you know, over dramified. Uh just depends though the market can very you know can be very unre you know unreasonable uh longer than you can basically stay emotionally um basically then then you can say solvent. So we'll see what happens uh in terms of the other names looking at things like more speculative names down to about 811 right here. So the same thing's happening especially with these highly uh favored X stocks. Uh, but keeping you guys on my radar, of course, we're making videos when the market's going up, when the market's going down, and kind of looking at what are some of the long-term names. So, right now, like I mentioned, my favorite one personally is Hood. However, I'm not going to possibly take any entries into Hood, depending on what's going to be happening here with crypto. What's going to be happening? Where's the bottom of this? You know, you see fear and free fear and greed at five. Uh, so it just kind of be sitting on the sidelines. Uh, sometimes doing nothing sometimes is the best position, especially when these knives are falling very, very rapidly. So, we'll see what happens. We'll see what the return looks like. Peace out. Take care and I'll catch you guys later. Let me know what you think down in the comments.",
