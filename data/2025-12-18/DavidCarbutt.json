        "transcript": "Legendary billionaire investor Ron Baron has just dropped some nuggets on Elon Musk, Tesla, and SpaceX in two very juicy clips I have lined up for you. Now, if you're following the Elon Musk space or an investor in these companies, this is a mustwatch. Ron, I I guess maybe the the followup to that is, do you feel as though the investment philosophy that you've evolved over the course of the last few decades still maintains that same kind of momentum power in terms of investing for the future? And and how exactly have you evolved your investing philosophy over the years to identify the star companies of then and then more more recently some of the star companies like Tesla and SpaceX these days? Well, we're investing in what companies are going to become, not what they are at this moment in time. And so we have to if you want to rely upon other people's advice, you will never outperform. You'll be the same as everyone else. And so what we do is we do our own research. We have 212 people at Baron Capital. 45 are analysts and portfolio managers. Portfolio manager actually senior analysts. And what we do is we visit companies every day. companies come to visit us every day. Uh we talk to them every evening, every morning, every day and we try to learn about their businesses. What I've described it as is that we take a company and we rip it apart in our heads and we try to understand and then put it back together again and we try to find out and understand about what it is that makes that company distinct and different than others and gives it an advantage that other people can't duplicate. for example in SpaceX uh that what they distinguishes them and they're about to go public and again in u I guess in next June is my guess. Uh and what's different about SpaceX is they've been able to have a rocket that can use over and over and over again. No one else has been able to do that. So other people would use a rocket one time it could cost a hundred million dollars. Right now it cost us maybe $10 million to get to space. It will cost us very soon soon a do a a million dollars. It's Elon thinks it's going to cost less to go to space than it will to go from New York to London. So it's an amazing uh revolution and nobody can catch us. So because of that low cost to space what that is enabled is to have 10,000 satellites uh providing Starlink services to every inch of this planet. So basically you can now get broadband anywhere because of Starlink. Uh NetJets I've been trying to get NetJets to use Starlink for five years and uh and they had to get this regulation. had but uh but basically the head of NetJets sent me a note I guess two or three days ago and said because of I've been doing this 5 years because of uh of you and several others we've now we're now installing netjets on our planes on 600 planes 50 a month and and uh and and we would go places and you would lose communications you can't do it on netjets when you have a Starlink you'll be able to to do this everywhere. So, one business that has distinguished us in Starlink in in SpaceX is Starlink. 10,000 satellites, going to be much more. There's 8 billion people on the planet. Three billion don't have the internet. We're going to give it to them. That's number one. Number two, they've just announced fairly recently that we're now going to go and build data centers in space. All you read about now is uh data centers, how expensive they are. Three or four or five years of to build, cost several billion dollars, four or five billion dollars to build. Um and shortage of energy, shortage of uh of land, permitting. And what we're going to do now is we're going to put them in space. So now cooling is a huge cost. Put them in space, no more cooling costs. Put them in space, no more electricity costs. So basically, you're running it for power for free and cooling for free, which are enormous expenses. And one of the companies that we've invested in as well, another Elon company is XAI. And what they're going to do is use these satellites that they have, this network going to be a million satellites, a million. Now we have 10,000. So now it's going to be a million. We're providing this data center in space. and uh and XAI is going to be a main beneficiary of that to provide services like chat GBT but better. >> SpaceX dropped the cost of reaching space by orders of magnitude through reusable rockets and that cost collapse is unlocking entirely new business models that were economically impossible before. Ron Baron walks through how SpaceX built rockets that fly over and over instead of being thrown away after one use. Elon believes space access will eventually cost less than a transatlantic flight, which is pretty incredible to think. Why does dropping launch costs matter this much? Because access cost determines what's economically viable. When something is expensive, you only do it when it's absolutely necessary. When it gets cheap, you start experimenting. When it gets really cheap, you can build entirely new industries around it. Look at what happened with computing. Early computers cost fortunes and filled entire rooms. Universities and governments could barely afford them. Then costs dropped. Businesses bought them. Costs dropped more. People put them in their homes. Then phones. Now computing is so cheap we throw sensors into everything from refrigerators to shoes. The core fundamental of the technology didn't change that much. The economics changed everything. SpaceX is doing the same thing for space access. When launches cost astronomical amounts, you only send things up which you absolutely had to. Expensive satellites carefully designed to last decades because you couldn't afford to replace them. Military reconnaissance, science missions with years of planning. Everything was precious because getting there was so expensive. Drop those costs and suddenly new use cases appear. Consumer broadband from space becomes viable. Before Starlink, satellite internet existed, but it was slow and expensive because the satellites were far away and launches were expensive. Get launch costs down and you can put thousands of satellites in low Earth orbit. More satellites means faster speeds, lower latency, better coverage. So, the NetJet story Ron Baron tells shows exactly how this works. They wanted Starink for years, but couldn't justify it. Now, they're installing it on hundreds of planes. That's because the economics finally made sense. Building data centers on Earth is brutal right now. Land is expensive, especially near power sources and fiber connections. Permitting takes years. Construction takes ages. Then you need massive amounts of electricity and cooling. Data centers are some of the largest power consumers in any region they operate. Cooling is a huge operational expense because all those servers generate heat and they need to stay cool to function. move the data center to space and half your operating costs disappear. Space is cold. Heat can radiate away naturally when not facing the sun. You don't need enormous cooling systems and power comes from solar panels that work better in space than on Earth because there's no atmosphere. There's no clouds and you can orbit in a way which means there's no night. You're not paying for electricity. You're not paying for cooling. The two biggest ongoing expenses just vanish. This only makes sense because SpaceX made launches cheap enough. If it cost what it used to cost to get anything to orbit, space data centers would be absurd. The launch costs alone would dwarf any savings on cooling and power. But when launch costs drop that dramatically, the math changes. Expensive real estate and operational costs on Earth versus cheap launch and free operations in space. The equation completely flips. Cheap launches enabled Starlink. Starlink creates a global network connecting everything. Space data centers need that network to be useful. They're processing data but need to communicate with Earth. XAI wants to use these data centers because they can scale compute without the bottlenecks that limit Earthbased AI development. Those energy constraints, cooling constraints, permitting constraints, all gone. A couple more words from me and we'll jump into the second clip. If you've been meaning to get a proper understanding of AI, I build a course that teaches everything from first principles to some more advanced ideas like compute and physical AI in a simple, approachable way. Once you join, you'll get lifetime access and pricing will go up each time we add new modules. So, if you want in at the lowest price, now's the moment. Link is in the description below. What Ron Baron is describing is a vertically integrated stack where each piece makes the others more valuable. SpaceX launches make Starink economically viable. Starink creates communication infrastructure for space-based operations. Space data centers leverage both cheap launches and the Starink network. XAI becomes the first major customer showing this isn't theoretical. Real companies are planning around this infrastructure. This is the difference between incremental improvement and platform shifts. Incremental improvements is making rockets slightly more efficient or slightly cheaper. Platform shifts is when costs drop so far that entirely new industries become possible. Space manufacturing might be next. If you can process materials in zero gravity and launch costs are low enough, maybe some manufacturing moves to space. Tourism obviously is another one. Research facilities. Who knows what else emerges once the infrastructure exists and costs keep falling? Which brings us to the question of what actually makes this possible? Because plenty of companies have bold visions, most fail. So, what actually separates the one that actually pull it off? Let's watch this next clip from Ron explaining why he believes in this massive project. >> What exactly is the secret for you on finding the people that you think are the ones that you want to invest in? >> Um you're trying to judge people's intellect, passion, leadership skills, knowledge about industries, uh unique uh ownership of a business. you know, we want to be in the same boat that they're in. Uh, and thinking about the individuals who are running those businesses, whether they are running them to benefit themselves or to benefit all the investors as well as society in general. So, we're trying to understand the personalities, you know, where do they live, what do their children go to school, do they work, uh, how how what's their lifestyle like? uh how long have people uh been tenured at their business? How come? So we're trying to understand all the different aspects about how business operates and what are the weaknesses and strengths and uh and and be very thoughtful about you know nothing's straight up and when you see things that are straight up uh and it's the same increase every quarter from a year ago what most likely you found is a scam. And so what we're trying to find are companies with open-ended opportunities. I was writing in one of my quarterly reports uh that Cliff Greenberg and I had a client a long time ago. It was Fred Stein and he used to talk about dimension uh as one element that separated out one business from another. You say the same thing for individuals, but there's something special about him that you can just say, \"Boy, that's someone who I would like to bet on. That's someone who I trust. That's someone who I believe is going to run a business in the best interest of the executives who work at that company and individuals who work at that company as well as for the society they're serving with the products and services they offer. >> Ron, one of those people that have fulfilled and checked many of the boxes that you just mentioned is one that you've been closely associated with for the past decade plus at this point and that's Elon Musk. >> 15 years. 15 years now. Elon Musk uh specifically with regard to investments as you point out in Tesla, SpaceX which is now the biggest holding that you have. You mentioned you invest in XAI as well. The Elon Musk story is an interesting one because he has become one of the people that has been maybe the figurehead of American technological innovation over the course of the last 20 years. What exactly is it about Elon Musk that first drew you to investing in him as a person and then the companies that he manages? >> Oh, he's brilliant. That's obvious. And when we first met him in 2010 when he was going public, um, we thought we'd like to invest with him, but I thought it was unlikely. We thought it was unlikely he was going to be successful where he's doing a couple thousand cars a year and he thought that he could do 20 million cars a year. That didn't seem reasonable. But we continue to after meeting with him for a couple or three hours the first time. Uh we continued to follow him, visit him, talk with him regularly and the executives who worked in his company. uh in 2014 when it became obvious that uh his cars were uh meeting very strong demand uh we invested between 2014 and 16 uh $400 million and we made about $8 billion in that so far and then 2017 we were following SpaceX all along. In fact when I was in in the 1960s I worked in the United States Patent Office. Uh, I chose to work there instead of going to Vietnam. I had a draft exempt job. Sounded like a better deal to me. Uh, so when I was there, my art was chemical with chemicals. I was a chemical graduate in college. And, uh, so I was the person who in the 1960s uh, gave patents for all the coatings that went on nose cones to that wouldn't burn up when they came back to Earth. Anyway, so 2017 started doing research in the 60s and 2017 we began to invest in Tesla in SpaceX and we've invested about um a billion and a half so far and that's now worth about $10 billion and we think that uh it's likely they could go public uh next summer sometime and the valuation has been reported in the press it could be a trillion half dollar valuation. Right now it's $800 billion. Uh a week ago was $400 billion. Uh so how come how what separates them apart? What separates them apart? You know, we're uh I attended a board meeting. They asked me to come to New York to meet with a number of of uh board members about u I don't know a few weeks ago and we're talking about Elon and uh how young people they are just dying to work there and so they get they hire they have about 120,000 people and maybe uh 30,000 hires a year and uh to to get 30,000 people there where several million people apply for 30,000 jobs a year. Several several million. And then uh the chairman of uh of Tesla was telling me that they come there. We were asking about what what do they come here for? And he goes into these meetings. So take 30 or 40 young people or senior people in any one discipline that they're working on, whether it's software, whether it's hardware, takes them into a room and for a couple hours and goes around and talks to everyone and and asks some questions about what they're doing and keeps getting deeper and deep. Initially, it's it's general and deeper and deeper and deeper. And then at the end of the meeting, the people walk out of that room, especially if they're first-time engineers. They walk out of the room and they're shaking their heads and say, \"Can you believe what we've learned? Can you believe what we've just heard? Can you I am so glad I survived that meeting.\" So basically, the people who work there, they're saying they come there because they want to work with this person. The difference between visionary founders and professional managers is that true visionaries operate at every level from setting impossible sounding strategy to understanding the deepest technical details. And that combination attracts talent that competitors simply cannot access. Ron describes Elon taking groups of engineers into rooms for hours asking questions that start general and progressively get deeper and deeper. Elon engineers walk out amazed, especially first timers, saying they can't believe what they learned and they're glad they survived. Ryan emphasizes that Elon is brilliant and that young engineers are desperate to work at Tesla and SpaceX. The companies get millions of applications for tens of thousands positions annually. People come because they want to work with this person specifically. There's a special type of founder that builds companies no one else can replicate. It's not about charisma or vision statements or inspiring speeches. Those help, but they're not the core of it. The difference is technical depth combined with operational excellence. Most people can do one or the other. The rare ones do both. Steve Jobs understood this. He was an engineer, but he understood design and manufacturing at a level that let him make decisions other CEOs couldn't make. He'd look at a circuit board and understand the aesthetic implications. He'd visit factories and see inefficiencies in the production process. When Apple was designing the iPhone, Jobs was involved in details like the feel of the scrolling motion, the exact materials for the case. That was someone who understood how every piece connected to the whole. The Google founders did something similar in a different domain. Larry Page and Sergey Brin understood search algorithms deeply because they invented them. When Google was making technical decisions about infrastructure, they could participate in those conversations at the engineer level. They knew what was possible, what was hard, and what was a waste of time. That let them make faster, better decisions that competitors whose CEOs had to rely entirely on what their technical teams told them. Alex Karp at Palanteer operates this way, too. He's the philosopher CEO, but he understands the product deeply enough to talk to customers about specific use cases and to engineers about technical architecture. Palanteer's products are complex because they're solving hard problems. Having a CEO who gets both the strategic vision and the technical reality means less gets lost in translation. What Ron Baron describes with Elon is the extreme version of this. Taking engineers into a room and going from highle concepts to granular technical details in the same conversation is not normal. Most CEOs can do highle vision. Some can do tactical execution. Very few can do both and switch between them seamlessly. When you can do that, several things happen that create lasting advantages. First, you make better decisions faster. Most CEOs set direction, executives interpret it, managers implement it, and engineers build it. At each layer, information gets filtered and distorted. The CEO doesn't fully understand the technical constraints, so they set impossible goals or miss opportunities. The engineers don't fully understand the strategic priorities, so they optimize for the wrong things. Communication overhead is enormous in complex technical organizations. When the CEO can operate at every level, that overhead collapses. Elon can talk to engineers about specific technical challenges and immediately understand the strategic implications. Should we pursue this approach or that one? What does it mean for the timeline, the cost structure, the competitive position? He doesn't need to wait for information to filter up through layers of management. The speed then compounds. Small decisions happen faster. So, the organization moves faster. Better decisions happen because the person making them has better information. Over time, the gap between a company that operates this way and one that doesn't becomes massive. The slower company is playing by normal corporate rules. Secondly, this attracts a specific type of talent. Really smart technical people who want to work with people smarter than them. That sounds obvious, but most companies can't offer it. They offer good competition, interesting problems, career growth. Those things matter, but they're not unique. Every big tech company offers them that. What SpaceX and Tesla offers is a chance to learn from someone who understands the technical work at a deeper level than most people in the field. Elon asks questions they haven't even considered. He saw problems from an angle they missed. He made connections between different technical domains that they couldn't make because he's working across more of the problem space than any individual engineer. That's magnetic for ambitious technical people. They're not coming for work life balance. They're not coming because the job is easy. They're coming because they want to get better at what they do. And working with someone who pushes them technically is how you get better. Ron mentions millions of applications for tens of thousands of positions. That select ratio means they're building teams that competitors literally can't assemble. Even if a competitor offers more money, they can't offer the chance to work with Elon. This creates a talent density that becomes selfreinforcing. The best people want to work with other best people. Once you have a concentration of top talent, it attracts more top talent. They get people who wouldn't consider normal corporate jobs because those jobs aren't technically challenging enough or leadership isn't technical enough to understand what they're doing.

        "transcript": "Bill Gates and Google DeepMind CEO Deis Assaris just gave us the clearest picture of where AI actually stands right now. If you're into AI and interested to get an insidider peak, get ready because this is going to be a good one. >> AI is the most important thing going on. And you know throughout the history of Microsoft, we always were thinking about okay, when could we make breakthroughs in AI? that digital revolution that you know created the internet uh got you know everything online that's the foundation uh that the AI is coming into you know for me personally and you know now my full-time work is the foundation and so uh because of my uh relationship with openai and Microsoft I stay very on top of the latest advances and one of the foundation's goals is to make sure the poorest in the world that people who never meet a doctor, don't get farming advice, don't have a good tutor, uh that we're going to have AI freed to them in their native language so they can explain their health challenge. They can explain, you know, what's going on with their crops and and what step they should take. So, making sure it isn't a 10 or 20 year leg uh before those most in need see the benefit. Uh that is a a huge priority for us. But are you worried like some that AI is going to be a bubble? >> AI is only a bubble in the sense that not all of these valuations will end up going up. Uh some of them will go down, but in the sense that behind it is a technology that's deeply profound that will reshape the world. There's not the slightest doubt about that. Does it mean all of these companies with high valuations will all be winners? No. It's going to be hyper competitive. uh a reasonable percentage of those companies won't uh be worth that much. So in the sense of some uh overvaluation, yes, in the sense of is this uh profound and real and is going to provide all of these benefits including uh the health, education, and agriculture that we're working on. Absolutely. Nobody should have any any doubt about that. Gates is making the case that some of these high valuations won't hold up and some will indeed drop. But the underlying technology is profoundly real and will reshape the world. Gates's foundation is already working on getting AI to the poorest populations for health, education, and agriculture. And he wants to make sure there's no delay before people who need it the most can access it. Let's take a look at what AI is already accomplishing right now today, not in some distant future. Take self-driving technology. Tesla and Whimo are operating actual robo taxi services in multiple cities. Real people are getting into the cars with no human driver and going places. This seemed like science fiction just not too long ago. The sensors, the processing power, the algorithms needed to navigate complex city streets with pedestrians and cyclists and unpredictable human drivers. All of that had to come together. And it did. Every mile these systems drive, they get better. Traffic accidents kill over a million people globally every single year. These are massive numbers. The vast majority of those accidents happen because humans get distracted, tired, drunk, or just make mistakes. Self-driving systems don't have those same problems. They don't check their phone. They don't fall asleep. The reaction time is measured in milliseconds. As this technology spreads, we're looking at potentially saving hundreds of thousands of lives annually. Plus all the productive time people waste sitting in traffic or the cost associated with accidents and insurance. Self-driving vehicles operating as a service could reshape urban transportation entirely. Then you have something like Alphafold which might even be more profound in terms of impact. This is what Google Deep Mind is working on. Proteins are the fundamental machinery of life. Everything your body does like fighting disease, digesting food, moving muscles all depends on proteins. And proteins are just long chains of amino acids that fold into specific threedimensional shapes. That shape determines what the protein does. For decades, scientists have been trying to predict how proteins fold. You can sequence the amino acids easily now, but figuring out what shape they'll fold into, that required years of expensive experimentational work for each protein. It was a very, very time consuming process. There are millions of proteins we knew the sequels for but had no idea what shape they took, which meant we didn't really understand what they did. Google Deep Mind's Alpha Fold solves this problem. An AI system that can predict protein structures from just the amino acid sequence with extraordinarily accuracy. Deep Mind released predictions for basically every protein known to science. Hundreds of millions of structures. They just handed this to researchers worldwide for free. Drug discovery relies on understanding protein structures. If you want to design a drug that targets a specific protein involved in a disease, you need to know that protein shape so your drug molecule can fit into it like a lock and key. Alpha fold accelerates this entire process. Research that would have taken years can now happen in days or weeks. We're already seeing results. Researchers are using Alpha to work on malaria vaccines, on understanding antibiotic resistance, on rare genetic diseases. The entire field of structural biology got fast forwarded by what might be decades. And this compounds over time. Every drug developed faster means the patients helped sooner means more researchers freed up to tackle other problems means the whole system moves faster. Bill Gates mentioned his foundation's work on health, education, and agriculture for the world's poorest populations. These AI applications connect directly to that mission. Imagine a farmer in rural Africa who can take a photo of their diseased crops and get an instant diagnosis and treatment recommendation in their own language. That's doable now. The computer vision to identify plant diseases exists. The translation technology exists. The mobile phone infrastructure exists in most places. Or consider health care in regions where there might be one doctor for tens of thousands of people. An AI system that can handle initial symptom screening that can walk someone through basic diagnostics that can identify when something is serious enough to warrant the long journey to see that doctor. It's triaging and education and providing a baseline level of care where none existed before. This is why Gates isn't concerned about whether AI is real despite acknowledging bubble dynamics in valuations. The technology is already saving lives and creating economic value in concrete, measurable ways. During the com bubble, pets.com failed spectacularly. But Amazon was in that same bubble with people calling its valuation crazy. The internet was still going to reshape commerce regardless of which specific companies succeeded. Same dynamic here. Some AI startups with massive valuations will disappear. Training these models takes enormous amounts of resources. Getting distribution is incredibly difficult when you're competing with Microsoft and Google. But that doesn't change what the technology enables. Self-driving vehicles will still transform transportation. Protein folding predictions will still accelerate drug discovery. AI tutoring systems will still help kids learn. Medical diagnostic tools will still catch diseases earlier. So Gates is confident in the technology despite some overvaluation. Deis Saris, Google DeepMind CEO and founder, takes this even further when he explains why Google specifically is positioned to win regardless of how the bubble question plays out. >> Um, and last time we spoke, you said that you thought AI was overhyped in the short term but underhyped in the long term. Um, and I know that this year there's been a lot of chatter about an AI bubble. >> Yes. >> What happens if there is a bubble and it bursts? what happens. >> Well, look, I I think yes that I still subscribe to it's overhyped in the short term still and still underappreciated in the in the medium to long term what's going to you know how transformative it's going to be. Um yeah, there is a lot of talk of course right now about AI bubbles. Um in my view uh I I think it there isn't it's not one thing binary thing are we or aren't we? I think there are parts of the AI ecosystem that are probably in bubbles. One one example would be, you know, just seed rounds for startups uh that basically haven't even got going yet and they're raising at tens of billions of dollars uh valuations just out of the gate. It's sort of interesting to see how how can that be sustainable. Um you know, my guess is probably not uh at least not in general. Um so there's that area. Then the people are worrying about obviously there's there's the big tech valuations and other things. I think there's a lot of real business underlying that. So um but it remains to be seen. I mean I think maybe for any any uh new unbelievably transformative and profound technology of which of course AI is probably the most profound. Uh you're going to get this uh overcorrection in a way. So when we started Deep Mind, no one believed in it. No one thought it was possible. People were wondering what's AI for anyway. And then now fast forward 10 15 years and now obviously it seems to be the only thing people talk about in business. And um so it's a but you're sort of going to get it's almost an overreaction to the underreaction. Um so I think that's natural. I think we saw that with the internet. I think we saw with mobile and I think we're we're seeing it or going to see it again with AI. Um I don't worry too much about are we in a bubble or not because from my perspective as you know leading Google deep mind and also obviously with Google as as and alphabet as a whole our job and my job is to make sure either way we uh come out of it very strong and I think and we're very well positioned and I think we are tremendously well positioned either way. So if it continues going like it is now fantastic. we'll carry on, you know, all of these great things that we're doing and experiments and progress towards AGI. If there's a retrenchment, fine. Then also, I think we're in a great position because, uh, we have our own stack with TPUs. We also have, um, all these incredible Google products and, you know, the profits that all makes to plug in our AI into. And we're doing that with search is totally revolutionized by AI overviews, AI mode, with Gemini under the hood. We're looking at workspace at email, you know, at YouTube. So, there's all these amazing things in Chrome. There's a lot of these amazing things that um AI we can see already are lowhanging fruit to apply uh Gemini 2 as well of course as Gemini app which is doing really well as well now and and and the idea of universal assistant. So, there's new products and I think they will in the fullness of time be super valuable but we don't have to rely on that. we can just power up our existing uh ecosystem. Uh which is all sort of I think that's what's happened over the last year. We've got that really efficient now. Demo service says that Google has the exact combination needed to dominate AI. They have all these existing products that already make massive profits. Search, Gmail, YouTube, Chrome, Workspace, and more. They're plugging AI into this existing ecosystem. There's a formula for winning in technology. You need two things that are both really hard to get. You need to build something that people actually want to use and you need to get a way of getting it in front of them. Product and distribution. Most companies only have one. Google has both. And overwhelmingly, Google search is used by billions of people every single day. People go to Google like a reflex when they need information. That habit is so integrated that Google became a verb. Gmail has over a billion active users. YouTube is the second most visited website on the planet. Chrome is the dominant web browser. Android runs on most of the world's smartphones. This matters enormously for AI because distribution is arguably the hardest part. You can build the most amazing AI model in the world, but if nobody uses it, it doesn't matter. Look at all the AI startups trying to compete. They build impressive technology, but then they face the brutal reality of customer acquisition. How do you get people to try your product? How do you break their existing habits? How do you get them to switch from what they already use? Google doesn't have this problem. They already have the users, billions of them, every day coming back repeatedly. When Google adds AI features to search, those features immediately get exposed to more people than most startups will reach in their entire existence. When they integrate Gemini into Gmail, it's instantly available to over a billion inboxes. Search is the obvious example. Google completely revolutionized search with AI overviews. Instead of just showing links, search now synthesizes information and gives you a direct answer. Gmail can now help you write emails. It suggests responses. It can draft messages based on brief prompts. Google Docs has an AI writing assistant. Google Sheets can analyze data and generate insights. These are tools people already use for work every single day. The AI features aren't asking people to change their behavior or adopt new software. They're just making existing workflows better. Maps, photos, calendar. Google has dominant products across so many categories. Each one becomes a distribution channel for AI capabilities. Their improvements to tools people already depend on. Now combine that distribution advantage with the product side. Demis mentions that Google has their own chip stack with TPUs. Training and running AI models requires massive computational power. Most companies rent this from cloud providers. They're dependent on AWS or Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud. They're paying by the hour for GPU access. Google makes their own AI chips specifically optimized for machine learning workloads called TPUs, Tensor Processing Units. Now, if you're a bit confused and if you've been wanting to learn about AI but don't know where to start, I built a course that walks you through everything step by step from the basics to deeper concepts like compute and physical AI. Once you join, you get lifetime access and as we add new modules, the price will rise. So, right now is the lowest price it will be. Link is in the description. So, back to TPUs. They've been developing these for years. This means their costs to train and run models are different than companies buying compute on the open market. When there's a downturn and everyone's worried about efficiency and unit economics, having your own chip infrastructure is an enormous advantage. It also means they're not fully dependent on Nvidia or other chip suppliers. There have been shortages of high-end AI chips. Companies waiting months for GPU deliveries. Google's making their own. They control their own supply chain for the most critical resource in AI development. Then Sarabis leads Google DeepMind, which merged Deep Mind and Google Brain, probably the two best AI research teams on the planet. Deep Mind was behind Alph Go, Alpha Fold, and countless other breakthroughs. Google Brain developed Transformers, the architecture that underlies basically all modern large language models. Gemini, their current model family, is competitive with anything else out there. The product quality is real. They're at the frontier of what's possible and they're continuing to push forward on AGI research while simultaneously shipping products. That combination, cutting edge AI research plus own infrastructure plus dominant distribution is basically impossible to replicate. Every other big tech companies don't have this complete package. Microsoft has distribution through Windows and Office and Azure, but they're buying the AI capabilities from OpenAI. They're a partner, not the builder. If that relationship changes, they're exposed. Apple has distribution through iOS and the App Store, but they're way behind on AI model development. Meta has strong AI research, but less dominant distribution channels outside of social media. Amazon has cloud infrastructure, but weaker consumer products. Google's the only one with worldclass AI research, owned chip infrastructure, and multiple billion user products across different categories. And this is what Deis means when he says they're well positioned either way. Disarvis also mentions this is a pattern we've seen before with the internet and mobile. During the com crash, most internet startups failed, but Amazon, Google, eBay, the ones with real products and actual users came out stronger. Same with mobile. Tons of app companies disappeared, but the platforms with distribution thrived. Companies raising at massive valuations before they've even built a real product. This is pure speculation. Maybe one of them becomes huge, but most won't. They're priced for perfection before proving anything. Google doesn't need to make those bets. They can watch what works, learn from it, and integrate the best ideas into their own products. Or they can acquire promising companies once valuations become more reasonable. One of our clients started with zero audience. Now they're doing $100,000 months thanks to YouTube. And they're not alone. We've helped three businesses hit that level just by growing them a YouTube channel. Want to see how this could work for your business?"
