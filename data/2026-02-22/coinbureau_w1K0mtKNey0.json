    "transcript": "On  the  5th  of  February,  Strategy  CEO   Fong  Lei  gave  investors  a  number  that   sent  a  chill  down  the  spine  of  the   entire  crypto  market.  He  said  Bitcoin   would  need  to  fall  to  $8,000  before  the   company  faced  a  critical  failure  point   on  its  debt.  Now,  on  the  surface,  that   sounds  reassuring.  $8,000  is  miles  away   from  where  we  are  today.  But  here's  the   uncomfortable  truth.  Strategy,  the   company  that  pioneered  the  Bitcoin   Treasury  model,  is  currently  underwater   on  its  massive  bet.  With  an  average   purchase  price  of  over  $76,000  per  coin   and  Bitcoin  trading  in  the  $60,000   range,  the  buffer  is  gone.  And  they   aren't  alone.  Dozens  of  copycat   companies  that  followed  Michael  Sailor   into  the  breach  are  now  sitting  on   massive  unrealized  losses.  The  digital   asset  treasury  sector  is  facing  its   biggest  stress  test  since  the  model  was   invented.  And  if  these  dominoes  start  to   fall,  the  selling  pressure  could  be   unlike  anything  we've  seen  before.  So,   is  the  corporate  treasury  model  broken?   Are  we  looking  at  a  cascading   liquidation  event  that  could  push   Bitcoin  to  the  stone  age?  Or  is  it  just   a  healthy  shakeout  of  the  weak  hands?   And  that  is  exactly  what  we  are  going  to   be  diving  into  today.  My  name  is  Nick   and  you're  watching  the  Coin  Bureau.   First  things  first,  let's  look  at  the   elephant  in  the  room,  Strategy,  formerly   known  as  Micro  Strategy.  As  of   midFebruary  2026,  Strategy  holds  a   staggering  717,131   Bitcoin.  That  is  roughly  3.4%  of  every   Bitcoin  that  will  ever  exist.  They   acquired  this  stack  for  a  total  cost  of   about  $54.5  billion,  which  puts  their   average  purchase  price  at  approximately   $76,027   per  coin.  Now,  with  Bitcoin  recently   trading  between  $66,000  and  $68,000,   that  means  the  world's  largest  corporate   Bitcoin  holder  is  officially  underwater.   They  are  sitting  on  an  unrealized  loss   of  nearly  $6  billion.  But  the  headline   that  grabbed  everyone's  attention  wasn't   the  unrealized  loss.  It  was  the  $8,000   figure  they  mentioned  during  their  Q4   earnings  call.  CEO  Fong  Lei  stated  that   if  Bitcoin  were  to  drop  to  $8,000,  the   value  of  their  Bitcoin  reserve  would   roughly  equal  their  net  debt.  At  that   point,  the  maths  breaks  down.  But  well,   what  does  that  actually  mean?  To   understand  this  risk,  you  have  to  look   under  the  hood  of  their  debt  structure.   Strategy  has  accumulated  about  $8.2   billion  in  convertible  senior  notes.   Now,  this  is  where  things  get  a  bit   technical,  so  listen  carefully.  Unlike  a   margin  loan  you  take  out  on  a  crypto   exchange,  these  convertible  notes  do  not   have  a  traditional  liquidation  price.   They  are  unsecured  and  that  means   Bitcoin  is  unencumbered.  No  one  can   force  strategy  to  sell  its  Bitcoin  just   because  the  price  drops  below  their  cost   basis.  The  $8,000  figure  is  a   theoretical  solvency  flaw,  not  a   liquidation  trigger.  Basically,  at   $8,000  per  coin,  their  $717,000  Bitcoin   would  be  worth  about  $5.7  billion,  which   is  roughly  equal  to  their  net  debt  after   you  account  for  their  cash  reserves.  So,   strategy  isn't  going  to  get  a  margin   call  tomorrow,  but  that  doesn't  mean   that  they  are  out  of  the  woods.  The  real   danger  lies  in  the  calendar.  The  first   major  hurdle  comes  in  September  2027.   That  is  when  holders  of  over  $1  billion   in  convertible  notes  can  demand  cash   repayment  if  the  stock  price  isn't   performing.  If  Bitcoin  is  languishing  in   a  bare  market  at  that  time,  Strategy   can't  just  print  more  shares  to  pay  them   off  without  diluting  shareholders  into   oblivion.  They  would  need  cash.  And  to   get  cash,  they  might  need  to  sell  some   Bitcoin.  And  remember,  Strategy  has   obligations.  They  have  roughly  $888   million  a  year  in  interest  and  dividend   payments  to  service.  Sure,  they  have   $2.25  $.25  billion  cash  reserves  right   now,  which  buys  them  about  2  and  1/2   years  of  runway.  But  if  we  enter  into  a   prolonged  crypto  winter,  that  runway   starts  to  look  a  lot  shorter.  There  is  a   caveat  here  though,  and  that  is  that   Michael  Sailor  came  out  a  few  days  ago   and  said  that  the  long-term  plan  is  to   quote  equitize  that  debt  over  time,  and   this  could  reduce  the  risk  of  debt   exceeding  the  size  of  the  available   Bitcoin.  But  while  strategy  has  a   fortress  balance  sheet  designed  to   weather  the  storm,  the  same  cannot  be   said  for  the  copycats.  You  see,  strategy   success  spawned  a  legion  of  imitators.   In  2025  alone,  public  companies  added   nearly  half  a  million  Bitcoin  to  their   balance  sheets.  But  many  of  these   players  are  smaller,  less  capitalized,   and  far  more  vulnerable.  Take  Bitmine   Immersion  for  example.  Bitmine  pivoted   hard  into  an  Ethereum  treasury  strategy,   accumulating  over  4  million  ETH,  but  uh   their  timing  was  well,  let's  just  say  it   wasn't  ideal.  With  an  average  cost  price   of  around  $3,800  per  ETH  and  prices   dropping  significantly  below  that,  they   are  sitting  on  unrealized  losses   estimated  to  be  over  $7.9  billion.  That   is  a  massive  hole  in  the  balance  sheet.   And  unlike  Strategy,  which  has  a  legacy   software  business  generating  cash,  many   of  these  copycat  firms  are  pure  play   crypto  bets.  If  their  assets  drop,  their   equity  value  evaporates  and  their   ability  to  raise  money  to  service  their   debt  vanishes.  And  we  are  already  seeing   the  smart  money  head  for  the  exits.  Just   a  few  days  ago  on  the  17th  of  February,   filings  revealed  that  billionaire   investor  Peter  Teal  and  his  founders   fund  fully  exited  their  position  in   ETHZilla.  They  sold  everything.  Now,   when  one  of  the  smartest  macro  investors   in  the  world  dumps  his  entire  stake  in  a   digital  asset  treasury  firm,  it  sends  a   signal.  It  suggests  that  the  easy  money   phase  of  the  treasury  trade  is  over.  And   it  gets  worse.  Galaxy  Digital  recently   warned  in  their  annual  report  that  five   or  more  of  these  digital  asset  treasury   companies  are  at  a  high  risk  of  a   failure  or  forced  liquidation.  And  this   brings  us  to  the  systemic  risk.  The   nightmare  scenario  isn't  just  one   company  failing.  It's  the  contagion.  And   speaking  of  staying  ahead  of  contagion   and  market  risks,  you  need  to  be  where   the  news  breaks  first.  The  Coinbau   Telegram  channel  is  where  we  share  the   latest  breaking  news,  provide  deep  dive   alpha,  and  give  you  the  most  important   market  updates,  all  pinged  directly  to   your  device  so  you  don't  miss  a  thing.   Whether  it's  Peter  Teal  selling  out  of  a   digital  treasury  company  or  a  new   regulatory  crackdown,  our  members  knew   about  it  first.  So,  sign  up  today  using   the  link  down  below  or  by  scanning  this   QR  code  over  here.  Now,  back  to  the   risks.  We  are  looking  at  a  dual  threat   to  Bitcoin's  price.  A  demand  shock  and  a   supply  shock.  First,  the  demand  side.   For  the  last  2  years,  these  corporate   treasuries  have  been  a  massive  source  of   buying  pressure.  Strategy  alone  bought   41,000  Bitcoin  in  January  2026.  If  these   companies  stop  buying  because  their   stock  prices  are  tanking  and  they  can't   raise  capital,  that  is  a  huge  chunk  of   demand  that  just  vanishes.  Second,  the   supply  side.  And  this  is  the  scary  part.   If  companies  like  Bitmine  or  the  smaller   players  identified  by  Galaxy  Digital  run   out  of  cash,  they  become  forced  sellers.   It  creates  a  feedback  loop.  Prices  drop,   companies  get  margin  called  or  they  need   the  cash.  They  sell  Bitcoin.  Prices  drop   further  and  further  companies  get  margin   called  or  need  the  cash.  We've  already   seen  this  movie  play  out  before.  We  saw   it  with  Luna.  We  saw  it  with  Three   Arrows  Capital.  Forced  sellers  don't   care  about  chart  support  levels.  They   sell  because  they  have  to.  And  we'd   already  seen  signs  of  this.  Onchain  data   shows  that  Marathon  Holdings,  another   major  player,  recently  moved  about  1,400   Bitcoin  to  exchange  wallets.  Now,  moving   to  an  exchange  wallet  doesn't  mean  that   they're  automatically  going  to  sell,  but   it  usually  means  they  want  the  option  to   sell.  So,  is  it  a  time  to  panic?  Are  we   heading  to  $8,000?  To  be  blunt,  almost   certainly  not.  And  here's  why.  The   $8,000  scenario  is  absurd.  The  average   production  cost  for  a  Bitcoin  right  now,   just  the  electricity,  is  estimated   between  40,000  and  $87,000,  depending  on   the  miner's  efficiency.  If  Bitcoin  fell   to  $8,000,  it  would  be  trading  at  a  90%   discount  to  its  production  cost.  The   entire  global  mining  network  would  shut   down  overnight.  It  would  be  a   catastrophic  failure  of  the  network   incentives  that  has  never  happened  in   history.  Furthermore,  the  institutional   flaw  is  much  higher  than  people  think.   Black  Rockck's  IBET  ETF  alone  holds  over   $54  billion  in  Bitcoin.  Sovereign  wealth   funds  are  buying.  Pension  funds  are   buying.  These  players  are  not  momentum   traders  using  100x  leverage.  They  are   allocating  for  the  next  decade.  If   Bitcoin  were  to  drop  to  $30,000,  let   alone  $8,000,  the  institutional  capital   on  the  sidelines  would  likely  step  in   aggressively.  So,  what  is  actually   happening?  We  are  likely  witnessing  a   healthy  consolidation.  The  Treasury   model  isn't  broken,  but  the  copycat   model  is.  In  2025,  it  was  just  too  easy.   Any  company  could  just  buy  some  coins   and  watch  their  stock  pump.  That  was  a   bubble.  Now  that  bubble  is  deflating.   The  underc  capitalized  players,  the  ones   who  bought  high  with  bad  debt,  they're   the  ones  that  are  going  to  get  washed   out.  And  frankly,  that  is  good  for  the   ecosystem.  It  transfers  Bitcoin  from   weak  hands,  companies  that  bought  it  for   marketing  purposes,  to  the  strong  hands,   like  long-term  institutional  holders.   Strategy  with  its  unencumbered  coins  and   massive  cash  runway  will  likely  survive   even  if  their  stock  price  takes  a   beating.  they  have  prepared  for  this.  Uh   the  tourists  they  have  not.  So  while   headlines  about  $8,000  and  insolveny  are   scary,  they  are  largely  noise.  The  risk   is  real  for  specific  companies  that   overleveraged.  But  for  Bitcoin  itself,   this  is  just  another  Tuesday.  But  what   do  you  think?  Is  the  Treasury  model  a   ticking  time  bomb  or  is  Michael  Sailor  a   genius  playing  4D  chess?  Let  us  know   your  thoughts  in  the  comments  down   below.

    "summary_hu": "Fong Lei, a Strategy vezérigazgatója, figyelmeztette a befektetőket, hogy a Bitcoin ára 8000 dollárra zuhanna, mielőtt a cég adóssága kritikus szintet érne el. Jelenleg a Strategy közel 6 milliárd dolláros nem realizált veszteséggel küzd, miközben 717,131 Bitcoin-t birtokol, ezt 54,5 milliárd dolláros összköltségen szerezték be. A közelgő kamat- és osztalékfizetések kockázata, valamint az induló költségek miatt a piac alapvető veszélyekkel néz szembe. A kisebb konkurenciák, mint a Bitmine, óriási veszteségekben szenvednek, miközben a nagyobb cégek, mint a Strategy, felkészültek a közelgő piaci nyomásokra. Az elemzés megkérdőjelezi a vállalati treasury modell fenntarthatóságát, de valószínű, hogy a Bitcoin piaca nem fog 8000 dollárra zuhanni. A jelenlegi helyzet inkább a gyengébb kezek kilépését jelenti, ami hosszú távon erősítheti az ökoszisztémát.",
    "summary_en": "Fong Lei, CEO of Strategy, warned investors that Bitcoin would need to fall to $8,000 before the company's debt would face a critical failure point. Currently, Strategy is grappling with nearly $6 billion in unrealized losses while holding 717,131 Bitcoin, acquired at a total cost of about $54.5 billion. The upcoming risks associated with interest and dividend payments, along with their cash flow concerns, present significant challenges. Smaller competitors like Bitmine face immense unrealized losses, while larger firms like Strategy are better prepared to cope with the looming market pressures. This analysis questions the sustainability of the corporate treasury model but suggests that the Bitcoin market is unlikely to drop to $8,000. The current scenario seems to signal a shakeout of weaker hands, which could ultimately strengthen the ecosystem in the long run.",
