        "transcript": "Gold and silver are both at all-time highs, and your gut is telling you that you've missed the boat. But here's the problem. Central banks are buying gold at levels we haven't seen since 1967, right before the entire global monetary system collapse. You have the biggest metal exchange in the world. Comx fighting the rise in prices. They just raised margin requirements again. And then you have the Basel 3 banking rules reclassifying gold from risky speculation to cash. And 11 nations representing half the world's population are looking to launch a gold back currency to challenge the dollar. So the real question isn't whether you're too late, it's whether you understand what's actually happening here. Because this isn't just about precious metals. This is about the biggest money shift since Nixon took us off the gold standard in 71. Stay with me because by the end of this video, you know exactly what the data says, what the legendary institutions are doing and whether you should be buying, selling, or sitting on your hands. My name is Felix. I used to be an investment banker. That's Winston back there. He does all the hard research around metals in this channel. Um, I'm also the founder of the Go Academy. We've taught well over 20,000 students how to navigate these markets. also the co-founder of tradevision.io. And if you want to just see what institutions are doing in the paper markets, well, look at what they did yesterday as I'm recording this. Massive, massive, massive institutional unusual trades in the dark pools where you don't usually see it. You can see that inside trade vision. I'll put a link down below to give you guys a free trial to that as well. And we're dedicating our time to help retail investors like you, like me, to understand what's actually happening. So, I want to talk about something that's making a lot of investors uncomfortable right now and is making a lot of other people a lot of money. You're watching gold and silver hit record highs and every instinct is telling you you're buying at the top if you buy now. But what if I told you that the institutions, the central banks, the people who actually move these markets, they're just getting started in my humble opinion. So, let's dig into the data, the history, and figure out what you might want to be doing right now. So, let me hit you with the facts. No sugar coating here. Gold's performance last year was extraordinary. All-time highs, 65% increase in the year. A very powerful sustained bull market action. Silver also at all-time highs, 163% gain. It outpaced gold last year. But here's what you need to understand. You and I aren't really driving this. Retail investors buying a few coins are not moving these markets. I know all the gold bugs tell you you do. It's bollocks. Who's moving it? Central banks. They're driving this. And they don't buy gold for fun. They don't buy to speculate. They buy because something is coming. Central banks are buying about a,000 tons of gold per year. The highest level in modern history by far. The last time we saw this kind of aggressive gold buying from the central bankers was 1967, right before the Bretonwood system collapsed. So who's buying this? Who are the biggest buyers out there? Well, National Bank of Poland, 95 tons last year. Brazil, by the way, they increased their target gold allocation to 30% of our reserves. Brazil bought gold for three consecutive months in a row. Other major buyers are Usbekiststan, Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Turkey, the Czech Republic, Kyrgystan, China. Why does this matter? Because the last time you saw this pattern, the entire global monetary system changed within a few years. They're not buying gold because it's shiny. I mean, I like that it's shiny. You might do, too. They're buying gold because they're preparing for a world where the US dollar is not the sole dominant reserve currency because the dollar's dominance is cracking. And yes, central bankers will always tell you the dollar is strong, the system is stable, everything is just fine. But the actions tell a different story. The dollar's declining reserve status, the share of global reserves, so what banks, central banks hold in 2008 was 65%. In 2024 was the latest data I could find. They might not want us to know where it is right now. That's a significant drop. A very significant drop. Seven percentage points doesn't sound like a lot, but it's more than a 10% drop. Trillions of dollars. So, countries are actively diversifying away from US dollar holdings. Now, before we dive deeper into this, I want to give you something even better, and it's free. We put out a daily and a weekly newsletter on gold and silver, like really in-depth, it's short, it's brief, it's free. You can sign up to that at felixfriends.org/metals. I'll put a link down below in the description as well. It'll be the first link, and you can just grab yourself either the weekly or the daily or both if you prefer. Um, and you can get that. That was my first free offer to you to make sure you're not just informed today, but you're going to keep being informed throughout 2026. And then the second part, if you're actually serious about your portfolio, news and the latest data is not going to make you into a great investor. It just won't. What will? Well, actually learning from the people who've traded this stuff, whether it's stocks, whether it's gold, whether it's silver, right? One of my mentors is a former London Metal Exchange market maker. you know, it's more about gold and silver than we'll ever learn and forget. Uh so, how do you how do you get access to someone like that? Well, you can. We literally offer a mentorship program with my mentors, including Elliot. And uh if you wish to learn more about that, we offer you a free call. I call it a freedom call. You can book that here. Find out more about how that works. Um the length, the details, all the questions that are running through your head. And um that's for people who are serious. So if you want to do that, go to phoenix/freedom, book yourself a call there. You can just select it on the calendar. It's very, very easy, very quick to set up. Now, diving deeper, countries are bringing their gold home. Does that sound like confidence in the US government? Germany repatriated hundreds of tons from New York. This is where I was born. Turkey moved gold from overseas to home. Poland moved 100 tons home. But in a Swed tried to get their gold from the UK and it was refused, which tells you everything, right? That's why people are doing this. Think about it. If you're a country, any country, and you own usually US dollars, that's normally what all of your reserves are in. Now, you don't actually hold the the the notes. That would be silly. It would take up like too much space. What do you buy instead? You buy government US government government bonds with it because they'll pay you, you know, 4% interest or something. You might as well get some interest. So, you buy those, but you don't physically hold those anymore. It's a digital thing, right? So, who controls that? Well, the US government because they issued it. So, they can take it away from you. It's the same like if your gold sits in New York, the US government can say, \"No, you can't have it.\" So, that's why these countries are doing this. Not because they don't like the US. It's just like prudent risk management, right? You want to have some assets that you control, which is why many people store, you know, gold under their mattress or something. I'm not a big fan of that. I think it's hugely risky. Put it into some professional storage. Um, cost you a little bit, but that way you're not going to get mugged, right? Broken into. So, that's what's going on with these guys. They don't want to get broken into either. So, it gets more serious than this. There are trade agreements in place that bypass the dollar. There are most of international trade has been happening in dollar right you want to buy oil you want to buy gas you want to buy you know some mining product coal or whatever you pay for it in US dollars because everyone's like yeah okay you know we're Zimbabwe or whatever you don't want our currency we want dollars you want dollars you've got dollars everyone's got dollars and it means that the countries have to have dollars but it's changing China and Russia are trading oil in local currencies not US dollars India and Russia are doing the same thing for more US dollars. China and Saudi Arabia looking at UN China and Saudi Arabia are discussing remmbbased oil trading. So every one of these deals reduces dollar demand and just chips away a little bit at the petro dollar system and that's supported the US since the 70s. On top of that, the BRICS countries are developing an alternative to the Swift system. What's the Swift system? Well, maybe if you're in the US, you don't really use it much because you just transfer things within the US mostly. But any international transfer around the world goes through the swift system. There's a swift code to every bank account in the world. And that system is owned and operated guess by who? The United States. Most innovation, most systems, internet and so on are actually US dominated and US owned and US run, right? US comes up with most of the innovation in the world, which is why it's such a great country. But if the Americans don't like you, they can exclude you from it. What does that mean? It means you could no longer trade with anybody in the world. That's the ultimate sanction play. We exclude you from the Swift system. Now you got to go and pay in cash or in gold, which is just not very convenient, right? Say you want to buy oil from the Saudis. They're 10,000 miles away. Are you going to bring them the gold? And they're like, I don't want your physical gold. Just send me the dollars. So the BRICS countries are developing bricks pay a backup plan. They are operational system though is already being used for billions in transactions. So central banks here are buying gold reducing dollar reserves moving their gold back home and they're building alternative payment systems. So the evidence is pretty overwhelming. The question is just like are you ready for it? Are you preparing for it? So this bricks goldbased currency called the unit. This happened in October 2025 and we talked about this last year. Bricks nation launched a pilot for a goldbacked settlement currency. They call it the unit. What is it? Well, it's a digital trade currency designed for again crossber transactions between bricks countries. It's not replacing the national currencies or it's not going to be used by the consumer for you know buying stuff online. The goal is simply listen to this reduce reliance on the US dollar for international trade. How's it structured? 40% of it is physical gold. 60% is a basket of bricks currencies. Brazilian realal, Chinese UN, Indian rupee, Russian ruble, South African rand each 12%. So all deposits and daily pricing run on a blockchain and the value is recalibrated daily based on the market price of gold and the exchange rates for these currencies. Now, why does that matter? Well, it allows these countries to settle transactions without using the US dollar. They can store their value using gold instead of foreign reserves. And it reduces their exposure to the dollar. So, it's a strategic move because they're worried about what? Dollar debasement and having their savings stolen right now. Is it going to replace the dollar tomorrow? No, of course not. It's a prototype. It hasn't been adopted yet. But there are significant and there are significant challenges to it. But this is the preparation phase. We're not in the crisis yet, right? But I don't like to plan for a crisis when I'm in it. We're in the stage where the world's most powerful nations are building the infrastructure for a postdoll world and they're backing it with gold. Right now there's a gold and silver ratio if you understand that. One goes up, the other moves in line with it over time. Now the next part and this is also really really really dull but incredibly important to understand. So give me a minute and I'll break it down for you in terms anybody can understand. This is probably the most important thing in this entire video and there's just one more thing that's also coming up. It's very very important. I need you to understand this because it explains why gold is rising and why I'm very bullish on gold for 2026 and beyond. What is Basel 3? Well, these are international banking regulations. They're created after the financial crisis of 2008. Um, they're named after a Swiss town called Basil. They used to go there because go skiing there. And the goal was to make banks safer and more stable. Allegedly, the rules basically tell banks how much money, how much capital do they have to hold and how do they classify their risk. Now, before this Basel 3 thing, you won't believe this. Gold was classified as a risky speculative asset of the lowest quality. Seriously, right? It's some sort of crazy Ponzi scheme investment. It's like Bitcoin equivalent. And then after Basel 3, gold is now a tier one asset, which is the highest quality, which is equivalent to cash, which is kind of funny really because cash is trash. But let me be very clear about what this means. The global banking system reclassified gold from crazy risky lunatic speculation to the equivalent of the safest asset there is. That's the most significant regulatory global change in financial history and no one's talking about it. Why? Because their eyes glazed over when I said Basel 3, right? So why does this create the mark? Banks holding gold are now incentivized by regulation. Gold has no counterparty risk. So if the government stops paying you on your bond, there's still some risk. If you own physical gold, there is literally no risk other than, you know, George Clooney nicking it out of your basement. It's just you and your gold. So banks globally are buying gold not just for speculation but to strengthen their balance sheets under these regulatory requirements. European banks are increasing allocated gold holdings. Asian banks have significantly expanded their gold reserves. So let me give you some numbers here. The total demand from Basil 3 compliance is about 2,000 tons. This is real structural demand. doesn't care about the price. It's not speculative dividends are requirement by law. And by the way, the regulation says no paper gold, no futures, no certificates, no ETFs, no physical gold in your own vault. Now, the annual gold production is about 3,000 tons. Industrial demand and jewelry takes about 2,000 tons, which leaves about a,000 tons available for you and me and the banks. Now the basil free demand is if you split it over the years to hit their deadline is 500 tons per year. On top of that central banks are buying about a,000 tons per year. So we have an actual shortage of gold which is pretty good if you own gold because it's just going to drive prices higher and higher and higher and higher. But this is where it gets even better. Europe implemented Basil 3. Asia implemented Basel 3. The US, guess what? They delayed it until when? They delayed it until 2028. The official reason, US regulators said they needed more time for banks to prepare. But the real reason in my humble opinion and Winston's research, the US delayed implementation because it would have created a massive instant crisis in the paper gold market. So let me explain to you COMX. It's a little problem that's called Comx. Comx is the Chicago Merkantile Exchange. It's the world's largest paper, gold, and silver market. Hundreds of billions of futures and options trades happen there. Most US banks have significant exposure to this paper gold which is unallocated gold. There's no real gold attached to it. It's leveraged to the hilt. And if Basel 3 was implemented immediately, the US banks would need to convert the paper gold to physical gold. But COMX doesn't have anywhere near enough physical gold to satisfy all these paper claims. There are somewhere between literally you gota you got to write this down as believer this somewhere between 100 to 200 ounces of paper gold for every ounce of physical gold in existence. So they would need 200 times or 100 times what they have. So why are they delaying it? It allows the system to slowly unwind these fake paper gold positions, quietly accumulate the physical gold and avoid a sudden crisis. But the problem is the rest of the world has been waiting. The Europeans and the Asian banks have been buying physical gold. US banks are going to wait. So when 2028 arrives and all these gold, all these US banks need gold. Where the heck are they going to get it from? Maybe from Asia, maybe from Europe. But when the US is finally implementing this Basel 3 thing, we'll have the demand shock of a lifetime. Now silver, my little silver bugs, is different. Why? Because sh silver should be following gold high, possibly outperforming it did so last year. The fundamentals are there. So why is the price still relatively modest? Well, we actually have a massive physical deficit of silver. Why? Industrial demand is exploding. Solar panels, EVs, AI chips, they all need silver. Now, if we get into solid state batteries for EVs, which would make batteries that last, you know, forever, um, you would require like a kilogram or more per vehicle of silver. So, the EV industry alone is about 3% of global demand. That's going to explode. Solar industry is about 16% of demand and growing very rapidly. Now mine production, so mining has actually been decreasing. Why? Well, particularly in Central and South America, we've seen that. Now, China has put export restrictions in on silver and it's creating against additional supply pressures. Elon Musk has said silver is important for most industrial processes and he's warning about potential problems here. So physical buyers in Asia are literally paying $35 more per physical ounce of silver than the paper price in the US. London silver balls are basically empty volumes that are falling by about a third over the last year. So the physical market is screaming there's real demand. So what's going on here? So I actually called some of the bigger silver dealers in Asia and Singapore particularly and they said to me, \"Yeah, you can buy some silver or gold, but delivery time is 3 to four months. So they haven't got any. There is no one in between. He's got some. It still needs to be like refined and melted. So what's going on here? Why is this being suppressed?\" Well, to understand the difference, you need to understand who owns gold and silver. Gold is held by institutions and by the wealthy by central banks. Gold prices rising strengthens all these people's wealth and their balance sheets. Silver is held by regular people. Silver is more volatile. Silver is sort of the people's warning system. So when silver explodes, which it clearly is, people start to notice and that's why it must be suppressed. also to save the institutions billions who happen to be short on it. You want some evidence on that? Have a look at this. CME Group has just done what they have increased their margins for gold and silver. Why are they doing that? Well, let me explain in a way that you can understand. The CME, the exchange raised their margin requirements. And what does that do? Well, anytime they do it, silver crashes. It means the leveraged retail traders and the smaller institutions get forced to liquidate. It's the same playbook they used in 1980s, in the 1980s, and in 2011. And the purpose here is that this suppression will allow the bigger players who were also short silver to unwind their positions with less losses or maybe make some money on it. But it can only last for so long because the physical metal demand is really strong. So when we get to the point where Comx can't deliver on its paper contracts because you have a contractual right to ask for the metal when you buy paper metal, the paper price will become irrelevant. Comx actually has about two weeks of global supply of physical silver. Sounds like a lot, but when that runs out, the paper price will become an irrelevance in Winston's opinion. And that's the moment when I think silver could actually explode. I don't think it's exploded yet. If you go back in history, silver was a lot more valuable compared to gold than it is right now. There are about 17 ounces of silver for every 1 ounce of gold. So this is silver. This is gold. Right? That ratio seems to be broken right now. I could come up with a calculation that would take us to 250 on silver. Not promising you that. I'm just saying in history that ratio has been very very different. So what does it mean for you? Let's connect all the dots. We're living through the early stages of the next global currency reset. The triggers are very clear. The petro dollar system is ending certainly shifting. Saudi Arabia is accepting currencies other than the US dollar. Russia is selling oil in rubles and remb. The dollar oil link is definitely breaking even though Venezuela will buy the US some more time there at least in its backyard. So where are we? We're in the preparation phase. Well, I put 2021. You know what I mean? We're in early 2026. We're going to see this bricks currency expanding. The China silver restrictions are going to get stricter and US basil 3 implementation will create a massive demand shock leading up to 2028. Now, the big banks are not dafted, right? Sounds like it, but they make billions of dollars, so they're not. Uh they're going to start buying gold going into that, in my humble opinion. And the alternative currencies are going to come to life. We're going to end up in a world where there are multiple reserve currencies, no single dominant currency. The dollar is not going to disappear, but its dominance will end. So, what does it mean for you? The dollars in your bank account will buy less and less every year. And in my humble opinion, the US government is doing everything it can to make sure you don't notice. So they're lowering the price of oil, right? That's what Venezuela is about. They're now lowering credit card rates, what Trump just announced, right? They're basically taking over the Fed to lower interest rates, which just means your mortgages, your car payments, all those things get cheaper. And what's the purpose there? The purpose is that you don't feel the inflation because your gas bills have gone down. But what they're hiding from you is the massive money printing that's going on, which will drive what? It'll drive the asset prices up, right? Look at the stock market last year. What did they do? 17%. That's inflation. Somebody got 17% wealthier. Some people are a lot more, but most people are a lot less because they didn't have their money in assets. The year before was 25%. The year before that was 25%. You add that together, you add almost 100% inflation over three years. So people got doubled their wealth in three years. And the things that those people buy have gone up significantly in price. But your ordinary items, they're going to try and suppress those prices so that Tom, Dick, and Harry doesn't find out. And when they do find out, it's going to be too late. Inflation is guaranteed. It is much, much higher than the government will acknowledge. and your retirement because your pension funds are tied to dollar is at risk here I think. So should you put everything into gold? No, I'm not saying that or even silver. I'm saying you want to be in high quality assets. What are highquality assets? This is real estate with a good return. They're quality stocks. Think about the ones with a good margin, the pricing power and so on. Although did you see Trump just saying he came out today and said um the big tech stocks need to pay for their electricity. He wants electricity prices to be lowered again. So Tom, Dick, and Harry don't notice what's going on. So Microsoft and Google and Amazon and these guys are going to have to pay more for their electricity. Um, which they can absorb, but again, it's going to impact their margins a little bit. Gold and silver doesn't really play part in these shenanigans. It is just physical, right? It's just physical. Now, for a metals portfolio, personally for me, I'm a fan of having more gold than silver. I think silver might have a stronger run up because of the the paper price manipulation quite frankly. So, but that's more of a trading thing than a long-term holding thing. It's also a lot more expensive to store it because it takes up a ton of space, silver. And um you know, I pay for storage. Now, gold also has the Basel 3 thing going for it, which is what I like. Uh but I do think silvers could outperform us in the gold in the short term. Um so, what what percentage do you put in it? Look, it really is a personal decision. I don't give you personal financial advice. Um, we have a lot of these conversations of course with our students. What do we then ask them about? Well, we say like, well, how many income streams have you got? How long until your retirement? Um, how are you presently set up? What is your allocation? What's your overall plan? Right? What are we looking at here? Um, and that kind of determines it. There is always a personal but I do think gold and silver has a place in most portfolios. Do I think paper gold and silver is a good idea? Not particularly. Now the ETFs in theory and do double check this for me before you make any decisions on anything. Obviously you got to come to conclusions. Um in theory they're meant to hold physical golds as a backup. But do they or do they just hold futures or something? That's what I would look into in more detail. And I haven't done that quite frankly. Maybe we can do that on another video if you guys be interested in that. Um, for the moment, stay informed. Um, get yourself our free newsletter. It's honestly completely free. I just think there's so little information out there. And most information out there, most people have very good intentions, but most people are selling gold or silver, right? Or storage services or some sort of financial services around gold and silver. We don't do that. So, it's just news, unadulterated news with no no product attached to it or anything like that because I think that way it's a bit more independent perhaps than what some of people are putting out there. So, grab yourself that free newsletter and if you're actually serious about really making a plan and really like becoming the investor you've always wanted to be, I think the only way to do that is to learn from people who've done this institutionally for decades. And that's what we do. So, if you want to learn from my Wall Street mentors, uh, book yourself a free strategy call. Uh we'll walk you through what mentorship would look like. Answer all your questions. There's zero pressure. Um the calls are about 30 minutes long. Felix/Freedom where you can do that. The link is also down below. And just bear in mind the central banks are buying because they they know what's coming. And Winston and I Winston Winston Winston. There he is. He's waking up. He's had a lovely hike this morning with his pal. That's why he's a bit sleepy. We wish you a glorious 2026. And may you profit. If I had to start investing today from scratch, knowing what I know about the $ 37 trillion debt crisis, the crypto reset, and what's coming in the next few years, I would do everything differently. Most people think"
