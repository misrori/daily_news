        "transcript": "Nvidia just dropped their Alpha Mayo self-driving platform and everyone's treating it like some revolutionary breakthrough. But this is Jensen playing catch-up to what Tesla's been building for years. Meanwhile, Peter Demandis and the Moonshots crew are calling 2026 the year autonomous driving becomes real transportation and why the next 12 months could fundamentally reshape how millions of Americans get around. >> Tell me your thoughts about that. You saw those headlines. I mean does it how does it kind of compare and contrast to to Tesla to Whimo Pros walk me through it. >> So with regards to Alpameo it's you know that mentioned it's the reasoning mix added to their self-driving platform. So you know you you you traditionally have these there can be some systems that are pretty rudimentary. They're rules based. They kind of simple but they can't handle complex things. Now uh Nvidia is adding this Alpameo reasoning to the mix. Basically what it says what it means is that you know you have sensors bringing in input uh you have training from the real world video simulation things like that that the the system learns but now it can also sort of reason to solve a particular problem like for instance what to do if if a traffic signal is out right what what now if you've add what it'll do is it'll it'll reason it'll it'll show text showing you that reason like like an LLM would right I see that this this light is out I should probably stop here then then move proceed cautiously so you see that stuff it's pretty to kind of have the ability to to to see the reasoning of the system. Now, Tesla's a little different. They have an endto-end neural network. It's all trained on the millions of hours of video that they collect u from their drivers. So, the system can just see and react to it. It's a black box, right? So, you can't really see why or how it made a decision. That was a change that Tesla made. Now Elon Musk said in response to seeing what um Nvidia did that they do also have reasoning but we we can't really check that because we don't have the ability to check in a closed system right so we don't really sure what's going on there but two different ways to sort of you know skin the cat here for self-driving right do you want to have a more like a more less complex a more a quicker and less computational taxing system that potentially Tesla has in place or do you want a more reasoning foundationbased model that is can can solve those edge cases potentially but it could also take a lot of computational power, cost a lot more money, need a lot more sensors, etc. I think you know, you think you know where this is going, right? >> It's January again, and by now you've started making resolutions to make the new year better for you. But the smartest people are already on the road to master that one skill that matters most in 2026, AI. From just a simple text model in 2019, AI has evolved to detecting diseases, automating work, and even running tasks in your sleep. And that's why I want to introduce to you the sponsor of this video, Outskill. They are hosting a 2-day AI mastermind training session live this Saturday and Sunday, 10:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Eastern on both days. And right now is the perfect moment to join because you can get in absolutely free. This 16 hours AI training has already built 10 million plus AI first professionals worldwide and is rated 4.9 out of five on Trustpilot. This is where you learn how to build AI agents that plan, write, execute, and report for you. Automate workflows that even run while you sleep. Use AI to save hours every week and get an unfair advantage at work. Not just that, you'll also learn how to profit from these skills. Seats are limited. Use the link in the description to join. >> Well, let me ask you, I mean, what what is do you think you saw? What is Jensen's endgame ultimately? I mean, do you would you expect okay, he launches his own robo taxi or no, he sells this tech to others? >> I don't think so. I mean, I think a big part of this is what people are are excited about is it's open source, right? all the all the models, all the the information, it's all on GitHub. You can see it. You can actually tinker with it. You can you and I can actually tinker with it right now if you wanted to, right? But that's still, you know, it still needs to be deployed in the real world. And I think that's why he wants to have partners like like Mercedes, which is the first car is going to get the full Alpameo stack in it, right? Uh you have GM, you have Hyundai that are going to use Nvidia's chips, right? So they'd rather build the chips and the modules, make money off that, have your have your companies like Mercedes, GM, and Hyundai implement it. uh and you mentioned robo taxi even a lubber and Uber and Lucid uh are partners with Nvidia and they're going to be doing a you know 20,000 unit robo taxi business that's going to be powered by Nvidia chips. So I think if you're a Jensen you like the ability to just keep cranking out the chips and the modules and not get into the business of running a robo taxi company for instance. Nvidia leaving Alpha Mayo isn't them leading the autonomous revolution. It's them acknowledging that Tesla was right all along and now everyone else needs a way to catch up. So, let's be clear about what's actually happening here. Nvidia is building a product for car companies that spent the last decade telling everyone autonomous driving was a fantasy. Remember all those legacy auto executives saying full self-driving was 20 years away? That Tesla was overpromising? Now suddenly Mercedes needs Alpha Mayo. GM needs Nvidia chips and everyone scrambling to catch up to a company they dismissed as a niche EV maker. Jensen's in the business of selling life rafts to companies that missed the boat. The data gap is the part nobody wants to talk about. Tesla has 7 billion miles of FSD data collected from their fleets. That's actual driving behavior captured from millions of vehicles operating in every conceivable condition. snow, rain, construction zones, weird intersections, pedestrians doing unpredictable things. Every edge case you can imagine, Tesla's neuronet network has probably seen thousands of examples. Mercedes is launching their Alpha Mayo vehicle in 2026. How many miles of training data will they have? A tiny fraction of what Tesla's been accumulating for years. This is why the approach matters so much. Alpha Mayo uses reasoning layers to think through novel situations. That sounds impressive until you realize it's a workaround for not having enough data. If you've seen a million examples of humans navigating broken traffic lights, you don't need to reason through it. Your neural network just knows what to do because it's pattern matched against real world behavior. Tesla's endto-end system learns from watching how humans actually drive. The real story here is validation. 5 years ago, the consensus view was that Tesla's vision only approach was reckless. That you need liar, HD maps, and geoence operating areas to do autonomous safely. Now, Nvidia's biggest partners are rushing to build autonomous systems, and the entire industry has shifted towards the approach Tesla pioneered. Jensen's making good money selling infrastructure to the later rivals. But the fact that legacy automakers are suddenly desperate for autonomy solutions tells you everything about who was right about the future of transportation. So Nvidia's building the catch-up gear for everyone who dismissed Tesla's autonomy vision. But what does the actual deployment timeline look like? Peter, dear Mandis, and the Moonshot crew have some thoughts on when this stops being a tech demo and starts being a real transportation. >> All right. Uh our next topic here, robots just crossed the line from demos to deployment. Uh and there's a lot going on. Uh let me hit with robots in cars first. So Elon's projection that FSD will be 100 times safer than humans in 5 years. I love this uh image here that I grabbed off the internet. Uh it's a billboard for those of you who are listening and it says, \"A car's weakest part is the nut holding the steering wheel.\" I love that. >> That is awesome. Uh so I mean listen FSD for those of you who have a Tesla right uh version 14.2.2 that's out I think is the latest is amazing. I'll take you pointtooint. Uh the other article here is Tesla's FSD completed a 2732 mile US coast to coast in 2 days with no interruptions no touching of the wheel. But I know Selene, you did a similar situation going from uh >> Yeah. So back in 2016 and 2017 and 2018, I did four trips from Miami to Toronto and back. >> Yeah. >> And I would get in the car, hit the autonomous driving. This is just basic autopilot. And it carried me across the country 80% of the time by itself. And what blew my mind back then was I'm essentially in a first class train cabin and it's 80% driving itself. Um, and because of the promotion I had when I got the car, the charging stations were free. The entire trip of 2,500 km cost me zero. >> Yes. >> Zero cognitive and zero financial. >> Uh, here's what's also going on in the autonomous space. Uh, we've got Zuks on the road. Uh, we have uh Whimo uh, you know, increasing their footprint. And this is at CES. They announced uh yesterday in fact that Lucid, Nurero, and Uber unveiled their global robo taxi fleet. So, it's a beautiful car if you're looking at it here. Uh you know, Lucid's had difficulty finding its place in the electric uh you know, automotive uh industry, but this partnership could be massive for it. So, they're going to be uh deploying this in late 2026 in the Bay Area. Uh, and it's a beautiful design and they're really focused on what they call luxury market, premium market, and they're pricing it close to Uber Black versus Uber X. So, um, anyway, a lot going on in this field. At the same time, we've got, uh, uh, we've got Tesla deploying its cyber cabs in Austin. Uh, and, uh, >> can I channel Alex for a second? >> Yeah. >> Driving is the first mass skill to be obsoleted. >> Yeah. Alex will channel Alex and say for many people I would predict that the first generalpurpose robot most Americans will ever encounter will be a robo taxi. I I think history will look back at at this decade, the the the soaring 20s, if you will, and say this was a seminal moment in time when we saw the first auton it's it's like the the first transatlantic railway. We saw the first trans or a transcontinental railway rather. We we saw the first transcontinental autonomous drive with no interventions. And we're going to see much more of that. >> I can't wait for the autonomous electric vehicles to come out that have beds in the back. So, if I'm in Las Vegas at, you know, at 3:00 a.m., it's instead of going to the hotel room and getting a flight in the morning back to LA, I just hop in one of these and they drive me while I sleep back to my door. The robo taxi market is about to fragment into distinct tiers. And the winners will be determined by cost structure and infrastructure, not just who has the best software. Peter mentioned Lucid and Uber's robo taxi partnership targeting the premium market pricing closer to Uber Black than Uber X. Meanwhile, Tesla's pushing towards unsupervised FSD with 10 million capable vehicles already on the roads. So, there's a really interesting market segmentation happening here. Lucid and Uber are explicitly going after the premium segment. They're building beautiful vehicles with luxury interiors, pricing them at Uber black rates. That's a real business. Plenty of people will pay premium for a nicer experience, especially in markets like San Francisco where Uber Black already does significant volume. But it's not going to replace mass transportation. It's going to serve the slice of the market that already pays more for comfort. The economics tells you everything about competitive positioning. Whimo and these premium robo taxi services are operating at roughly a dollar per mile in operational costs. That includes the expensive sensor arrays, the high-end compute, the remote monitoring staff, all the infrastructure required to run a small fleet in geoffenced areas. Tesla's Model Y's are predicted to be able to operate at around 50 cent per mile. The Cyber Cab when it hits production could be as low as 30 or even 20 cents per mile. That's difference between a $32 ride downtown and a $15 ride. At scale, that cost gap becomes insurmountable. The comparison to the transcontinental railway is actually pretty spot on here. We're talking about restructuring how hundreds of millions of people move through their daily lives. Right now, transportation is the second largest household expense after housing for most Americans. The average person spends over $10,000 per year on car ownership, payments, insurance, fuel, maintenance. If you can replace that with a ondemand robo taxi service that costs less than owning a vehicle, you're fundamentally changing household economics. This is a total paradigm shift. The next 12 to 18 months will tell us a lot. Tesla is targeting unsupervised FSD in Austin with some empty seat robo taxis already driving around Austin. They've been floating around since last month. They're moving from supervised autonomy to a genuinely driverless operation. Whimo's expanding to Miami and other cities. Lucid and Uber launch in late 2026 in the Bay Area. We're about to see whether the technology actually works at scale and whether consumers are ready to trust it. My sense is that once people experience truly hands-free transportation where you can sleep, work, or watch content while traveling, it's going to be very difficult to go back to staring at brake lights for an hour each way.
