    "transcript": "Banks  have  launched  a  secret  ad  campaign   to  kill  crypto  and  Coinbase  is  their   primary  target.  The  independent   community  Bankers  of  America  group  is   running  aggressive  ad  campaigns,   labeling  Coinbase  CEO  Brian  Armstrong  as   public  enemy  number  one  on  Wall  Street.   They  are  urging  senators  to  side  with   banks  and  ban  stable  coin  yields   entirely.  But  why  the  sudden  aggression?   Well,  according  to  the  bank's  own  data,   stable  coins  could  drain  $1.3  trillion   from  community  bank  deposits  and  reduce   lending  by  $850  billion,  which  are   pretty  terrifying  numbers.  But  is  this   actually  true,  or  is  it  a  desperate   attempt  to  try  and  protect  business   models  that  rely  on  underpaying  you  for   your  savings?  Today,  we  aim  to  find  out.   My  name  is  Nick  and  you're  watching  the   Coin  Bureau.   First  things  first,  let's  talk  about   this  ad  campaign  because  it  is  nasty.   Usually,  bank  lobbying  is  done  quietly.   It  happens  at  stake  dinners,  in  strip   clubs,  or  on  golf  courses,  and  behind   closed  doors  in  Washington.  But  this   time,  the  Independent  Community  Bankers   of  America,  or  ICBA,  has  gone  scorched   earth.  They've  latched  onto  a  narrative   that  frames  Brian  Armstrong  not  as  an   innovator,  but  as  a  threat  to  the   American  economy.  The  ICBA  represents   the  small  banks,  the  local  lenders,  the   guys  who  sponsor  your  little  league   team.  But  uh  don't  let  the  wholesome   image  fool  you.  This  lot  are  fighting   for  their  lives  and  they  have  identified   a  specific  enemy.  Their  campaign  is   targeting  the  Senate  Bank  Committee  with   a  very  simple  strategy.  If  you  let   crypto  companies  pay  yield  on  stable   coins,  you  are  going  to  destroy   community  banking.  and  they  have  the   numbers  to  back  it  up.  According  to  a   data  analysis  released  by  the  ICBA  in   December  2025,  allowing  crypto   intermediaries  to  pay  interest  or  yield   on  stable  coins  could  reduce  community   bank  lending  by  $850  billion.   >> Why?   >> Well,  because  they  estimate  it  would   trigger  a  $1.3  trillion  reduction  in   deposits.  Now,  to  put  this  into   perspective,  total  community  bank   deposits  sit  at  around  $4.8  8  trillion.   So,  they're  claiming  that  stable  coins   could  wipe  out  more  than  a  quarter  of   their  entire  deposit  base.  Yikes.  The   logic  goes  like  this.  If  you  move  your   money  from  a  local  bank  to  USDC  to  earn   a  5%  interest,  that  money  leaves  the   community.  It  can't  be  lent  out  to  a   local  bakery  or  used  to  fund  a  mortgage   for  your  neighbor.  Instead,  it  sits  in  a   Treasury  bill  backing  a  stable  coin,   effectively  funding  the  US  government's   debt  rather  than  your  local  economy.   It's  a  compelling  argument,   >> but  here's  the  thing.   >> It  relies  on  the  assumption  that  you,   the  consumer,  owe  the  banks  your   deposits  regardless  of  how  poorly  they   treat  you.  And  this  brings  us  to  the   real  reason  banks  are  scared.  It's  not   just  about  lending,  it's  about  the   spread.  As  of  February  2026,  the   national  average  savings  account  yield   in  the  United  States  is  a  measly  0.39%.   Meanwhile,  Coinbase  offers  up  to  5%  on   USDC  rewards  for  certain  customers,  and   through  their  new  onchain  lending   integrations,  yields  can  hit  as  high  as   10.8%.   That  is  a  massive  gap.  Banks  take  your   deposit,  earn  5%  from  the  Federal   Reserve,  pay  you  0.4%,  4%  and  uh  pocket   the  difference.  Coinbase  and  other   crypto  platforms  are  essentially  saying,   \"Hey,  we  will  give  you  the  5%.\"  And  that   is  why  Brian  Armstrong  is  public  enemy   number  one.  He's  giving  away  the  secret   source.  Now,  Coinbase  isn't  just  doing   this  out  of  the  goodness  of  their   hearts.  Of  course,  stable  coin  revenue   is  now  a  massive  part  of  their   operations.  In  the  third  quarter  of  2025   alone,  Coinbase  earned  $355  million  from   stable  coin  revenue  annualized.  That  is   roughly  1.3  to  1.4  billion  a  year.  And   that  is  a  serious  chunk  of  change.  And   it  effectively  makes  Coinbase  a  bank  in   everything  but  name.  And  the  banks   actually  hate  it.  Now,  if  you've  been   following  the  channel  for  some  time,   you'll  know  that  this  isn't  the  first   time  that  banks  have  tried  to  ban   competition.  In  fact,  this  is  almost  an   exact  replay  of  the  1970s.   Back  then,  banks  had  a  monopoly  on   deposits  thanks  to  something  called   regulation  Q,  which  kept  the  interest   rates  they  could  pay.  When  inflation   spiked,  consumers  were  losing  money  by   keeping  it  in  a  bank.  Sound  familiar?   >> It  sounds  familiar.   >> Then  came  money  market  funds.  They   offered  higher  yields  and  banks  screamed   that  they  would  destroy  the  financial   system.  They  lobbied  to  ban  them.  They   said  it  would  kill  housing.  They  used   the  exact  same  public  enemy  rhetoric  we   are  seeing  today.  But  guess  what?   Innovation  won.  Regulation  Q  was   repealed  and  consumers  benefited.  So  the   ICBA's  campaign  is  essentially  an   attempt  to  bring  back  regulation  Q  for   the  digital  age.  But  this  time  the   stakes  are  higher  because  the   legislation  that  would  decide  the  battle   is  currently  on  life  support.  And  this   brings  us  to  the  Clarity  Act.  If  you've   been  keeping  up  with  the  headlines,   you'll  know  that  the  digital  asset   market  clarity  act  was  meant  to  provide   clear  rules  of  the  road  for  the  crypto   industry  in  the  US.  But  in  mid  January,   everything  fell  apart.  Coinbase,  led  by   Brian  Armstrong,  pulled  their  support   for  the  bill  after  the  Senate  Banking   Committee,  under  pressure  from  the  ICBA   and  other  banking  lobbies,  inserted   language  that  would  effectively  ban   stable  coin  yield.  Armstrong  tweeted   that  quote,  \"No  bill  is  better  than  a   bad  bill.\"  Coinbase  calculated  that  a   ban  on  yield  was  an  existential  threat   to  their  business  model.  Remember  that   billion  dollars  a  year  in  revenue?  Yeah,   they  aren't  going  to  give  that  up   without  a  fight.  However,  not  everyone   in  crypto  agreed  with  this  tactic,  and   the  upshot  has  been  a  massive  split  in   the  industry.  On  the  one  side,  you  have   Coinbase  standing  alone,  refusing  to   compromise.  On  the  other  side,  you  have   heavyweights  like  A16Z  and  Ripple  who   will  still  back  the  Clarity  Act.  Their   perspective  is  that  some  regulation  is   better  than  none  and  they  can  fix  the   yield  issue  later.  But  for  Coinbase,   yield  isn't  a  side  order  of  fries.  It's   the  main  course.

But  back  to  the   fight  in  Washington,  where  things  have   escalated  quickly.  The  White  House,   realizing  that  crypto  legislation  was   about  to  implode,  called  for  an   emergency  meeting.  The  first  meeting   happened  on  the  2nd  of  February,  and  it   was  attended  by  the  ICBA,  the  American   Bankers  Association,  and  crypto  trade   groups.  By  all  accounts,  it  was  a   nothing  burger.  The  banks  thanked  the   administration  for  the  quote   constructive  conversation  but  gave  zero   ground.  And  then  came  the  second  meeting   on  the  10th  of  February  and  this  one  was   tense.  According  to  reports,  the  banking   lobby  showed  up  with  absolutely  no   intention  to  compromise.  They  held  the   line  ban  yield  or  no  deal.  The  crypto   side,  including  Coinbase,  Ripple,  and   the  blockchain  association,  reportedly   came  ready  to  deal.  They  offered  guard   rails  and  consumer  protections,  but  the   banks  weren't  interested.  And  why  would   they  be?  They  have  the  public  enemy   number  one  narrative  running  in  the   press.  And  they  have  the  Senate  Banking   Committee  terrified  of  what  a  supposed   $1.3  trillion  deposit  drain  could  mean.   And  as  if  to  spice  things  up  even   further,  the  White  House  has  given  both   sides  a  deadline.  They  have  until  the   end  of  February  to  reach  a  deal,   literally  days  away.  But  uh  why  the   rush?  Well,  it's  because  of  the  midterm   elections  in  November.  If  this  bill   doesn't  move  now,  it  runs  into  a  buzzsaw   of  election  season.  And  if  Republicans   lose  control  of  the  Senate  or  if  the   political  winds  shift,  we  could  be   looking  at  years  before  legislation   resurfaces.  We're  talking  2027,  maybe   2028,  a  lifetime  in  crypto.  So,  what   happens  if  the  banks  win?  Well,  uh,   let's  look  at  some  possible  scenarios.   Scenario  one,  the  Clarity  Act  passes   with  the  yield  ban  included.  In  this   world,  your  5%  yield  on  USDC  vanishes   overnight.  Coinbase  and  other  platforms   would  be  forced  to  stop  offering   rewards.  You  would  be  forced  back  into   the  0.39%  savings  accounts,  or  you  would   have  to  move  your  funds  offshore  to   risky,  unregulated  platforms  just  to   beat  inflation.  Scenario  two,  the  bill   dies  entirely  and  this  leaves  the  US  in   a  regulatory  limbo.  The  SEC,  which  is   admittedly  much  more  pro-  crypto  these   days,  would  still  be  largely  responsible   for  overseeing  the  industry.  If  another   Gary  Gensler-like  figure  replaces  the   current  chair,  Paul  Atkins,  at  any   point,  that  could  be  bad  news.   Meanwhile,  banks  could  continue  to   debank  crypto  companies,  and  the  US   would  continue  to  lose  ground  to   jurisdictions  like  Europe  and  the  UAE   who  have  already  figured  this  stuff  out.   Scenario  three,  a  compromise  is  reached.   Maybe  they  cap  the  yield  and  maybe  they   limit  it  to  accredited  investors.  But   given  the  bank's  posture  at  the  10th  of   February  meeting,  this  seems   increasingly  unlikely.  And  this  brings   us  to  the  uncomfortable  truth.  The  banks   aren't  trying  to  protect  you.  They're   trying  to  protect  their  spread.  They   know  that  if  you  realize  that  you  can   hold  a  digital  dollar,  send  it  instantly   anywhere  in  the  world,  and  earn  the   risk-free  rate  on  it,  well,  why  on  earth   would  you  ever  need  a  savings  account   again?  It's  the  Blockbuster  versus   Netflix  moment  for  banking,  and   Blockbuster  is  currently  lobbying   Congress  to  ban  streaming.  But  before  we   get  too  carried  away  bashing  the  banks,   we  have  to  acknowledge  one  thing.  That   $1.3  trillion  number,  while  it  is  the   worst  case  scenario,  the  logic  isn't   completely  flawed.  If  everyone  pulled   their  money  out  of  community  banks   tomorrow,  small  business  lending  would   dry  up.  That  is  a  fact.  And  yes,   community  banks  fund  local  construction,   small  businesses,  and  farms,  while   stable  coin  issuers  just  buy  US  treasury   bills.  So  there  is  a  legitimate   macroeconomic  question  here.  Do  you  want   our  capital  funding  the  federal  debt  or   do  you  want  it  funding  local  businesses?   But  the  answer  shouldn't  be  to  ban   innovation.  It  should  be  for  banks  to   compete,  offer  better  rates,  build   better  technology,  don't  just  run  as   calling  your  competition  public  enemy   number  one.  So  then  what  does  all  of   this  mean  for  the  future  of  your  money?   Well,  if  the  banks  succeed  in  this   campaign,  it  sets  a  very  dangerous   precedent.  It  says  that  in  America,  you   aren't  allowed  to  earn  a  fair  return  on   your  money  if  it  threatens  the  profit   margins  of  a  politically  connected   industry.  It  says  that  the  0.39%  you   earn  on  your  savings  account  is  all  you   deserve.  So,  the  next  few  weeks  are   critical.  If  the  end  of  February   deadline  passes  without  a  deal,  we  are   likely  stuck  in  the  mud  until  the  2026   midterms.  The  stakes  then  are  very   clear.  If  the  banks  win,  users  will   never  earn  5%  on  their  digital  dollars   again.  And  that  is  a  direct  attack  on   your  ability  to  earn  a  fair  return.  The   status  quo  persists  and  ordinary  savers   lose  out.  Love  crypto  or  lob,  that   doesn't  sound  like  a  win  for  anyone  but   the  bankers  who  will  celebrate  by   spending  the  money  that  should  buy   rights  be  going  to  you.  Now,  I  want  to   hear  from  you  guys.  Uh,  do  you  believe   the  banks  claim  that  stable  coins  are  a   threat  to  the  economy?  Or  are  they  just   scared  of  competition?  And  would  you   keep  your  money  in  a  bank  if  you  could   safely  earn  5%  on  a  stable  coin?  Let  me   know  in  the  comments  down  below.  And  if   you  want  to  understand  more  about  the   specific  mechanics  of  how  stable  coins   actually  generate  that  yield,  then  you   can  check  out  our  video  on  that  right   over  here.  That's  all  from  me  today.   Thank  you  guys  very  much  for  watching   and  I'll  see  you  again  soon.  This  is   Nick  signing  off.",
