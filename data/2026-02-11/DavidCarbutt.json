        "transcript": "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I've got a big one for you today. I firstly have a clip from Jensen Hang explaining why $660 billion in hypers scale spending this year is completely justified and Brad Gersonner chips in as well in that clip, no pun intended. In clip two, Kathy Wood breaks down why this AI cycle looks nothing like a bubble and why Bitcoin falling actually makes perfect sense. And we've also got a bonus clip at the end from the all-in crew talking about the recent SAS crash. This is a juicy one. All of a sudden, AI over the last couple of years went from being curious to super useful. The inflection point also came with it. Profitable tokens. Anthropic is making great money. OpenAI is making great money. If they could have twice as much compute, the revenues will go up four times as much. I mean literally these guys are so demand cons so compute constrained and the demand is so incredibly great the number of uh enterprise users the number of consumer users the number of startups are being built on top of these companies it's just going through the roof. >> So when you see numbers that are frankly remarkable that $660 billion this year will be spent by the hyperscalers as we continue to learn like we did from Amazon last night. you sit back and think to yourself that's completely justified based on what you see. >> It is appropriate and sustainable and the reason for that is because all of these companies cash flows are going to start rising. You know people are comparing it to cash flows. One of those numbers are wrong. It's just the cash flow is wrong. We are addressing the largest software opportunity in history. For the very first time software is not just a tool. A tool is like Excel. Now software uses tools. So these AIs use Excel. And so I think the the uh the opportunity to to uh for this new new era of software is incredible. And we're seeing it already uh moving the earnings of Meta. Nobody uses AI better than Meta. And so if you look at the way that they're using AI, AI went from a recommener system running on CPUs to now a generative AI agentic system that is making recommendations. Everything from the way they social media works and the way they they recommend ads and help uh advertisers create content has fundamentally been changed and their earnings show it and that's the reason why they're investing so hard. They see just a much larger future potential for it and not just one company. This is going to affect AWS is shopping and the way they recommend goods. This is going to affect how Microsoft's enterprise software works. Every single company is is sees the same inflection point and that's why everybody leaning in so hard. >> I feel like that's the point that you were it's an interesting point. It sort of turns the way you you need to think about these businesses on its head that if you're just fixated on the spending side as you were talking earlier about oh they're spending such a huge portion of their free cash flow you're kind of missing the story. The market needs to get its arms around that. Do you as well as an investor? >> Yes. I if you turn the clock back Scott to 2008 2009 right Amazon could have taken their profits and sent them back to us by way of dividends. Instead, Jeff Bezos said, \"I'm going to invest in this thing called AWS.\" Think of it as digging a gold mine. You have to spend a lot of money to dig the gold mine before you get the money before you get the gold out. These guys are digging the biggest gold mine in the history of software, right? But it costs something up front. Now the question is do you believe Andy Jasse and Mark you know Mark Zuckerberg and Sundar and Jensen that this opportunity is that big or do you have a special insight that causes you to understand there's no gold in the bottom of the gold mine. As an investor I'll just tell you this. I want my personal net worth I want my funds net worth levered against AI because all human progress is going to be derived from machines helping humans think and augment human thinking. So whether it's owning Nvidia, which is our largest public position, or whether it's Anthropic or OpenAI, all of these companies are going to be tremendous beneficiaries, and they're doing it at scale. There are increasing advantages to scale, right? And so I think it's hard for people to get their arms around now, just like it was in 2008 and 2009. But thank god Jeff Bezos did that. Now it's $140 billion business generating 30 billion a year in annual profits that people criticized him for investing in back then. How can I just It's incredible that OpenAI and Anthropic are 20 billion run rate companies pro generating profitable revenues and accelerating growth all at the same time. These are extraordinary things and it makes perfect sense from where we sit. How can we be so certain that the amount of compute we think we'll need and that we continue to hear from CEOs like you that we will need is actually going to come to fruition. Isn't it inevitable that we're going to at some point overdo it, but we're not going to know that until it's too late? >> It's not like roads. Roads once you lay it down, it stays fairly useful for a long time. The way computers work is you build up the infrastructure, but then you start replacing it five, six, seven years later. And so I think it's going to take us some seven years, eight years to build up to the level that we have to sustain. And after that, we're going to be refreshing and slightly growing. And so we've got several years of build out ahead of us. >> Every major AI company is hitting the same wall. They can't buy compute fast enough. And that constraint is what Jensen claims proves the market is real. Before we jump in, if you're trying to understand the AI infrastructure side of things, the chip, the compute, and why it all matters, I made a course called the AI landscape. This course is designed to break AI down in a digestible way. Links in the description. You get lifetime access, and the price goes up as we add new modules. So, Jensen drops this number, $660 billion in hypers scale capex this year. And yeah, you're not wrong to hear that and think bubble. I mean, that's a massive number, but Jensen's argument is that Anthropic, Open AAI, these companies are starting to make real money. And he says they're so computed that if they had twice as much infrastructure, their revenues would go up by up to four times. So, in his mind, this is a demand problem, not a supply problem. And he uses Meta as his proof. He says, \"Nobody uses AI better than meta.\" They went from a basic recommendation system on CPUs to a generative AI system. They went from a basic recommendation system on CPUs to a generative AI agentic system and now the earnings back it up. Now, does every company see those same returns? That's a different question, but Meta's numbers are hard to argue with. Then Brad Gersa jumps in with the AWS thing. Back in 2008, 2009, people were tearing into Amazon for pouring money into cloud infrastructure instead of giving cash back to shareholders. Bezos was basically saying, \"Trust me, bro. There's gold at the bottom of this mine and AWS is now a $140 billion business doing $30 billion a year in profit. Brad Gler is saying we're at that exact moment again. You can stare at the spending and freak out or you can look at what it's producing. Though, and this is worth remembering, for every AWS, there were a lot of companies that spent big on infrastructure and got absolutely nothing back. Jensen also talks about timeline. He says it's going to take 7 8 years to build our AI infrastructure to where it needs to be and then you're refreshing and growing from there. So if he's right, this spending wave has a long way to go and compute infrastructure is completely different because it gets upgraded constantly. Brad's clearly all in. He says he wants his entire net worth leveraged against AI. So that's Jensen and Brad making the bull case from the supply side. Kathy Wood comes at the same question but from a different angle. In this next clip, Kathy's addressing the thing holding a lot of investors back, the dotcom comparison. She's got a chart showing tech capex as a percent of GDP, and it's back at bubble levels, but she makes the case that the similarities end there, and then she gets into Bitcoin and gold where something kind of weird is going on. One thing we can say about this cycle is the demand for GPUs is voracious and they are landing in these data centers uh which are saying we need more capacity, we need more chips. Uh those GPUs are not dark. Uh and I'm stealing that from uh Brad Gersonner at Altimter. I thought that was a very good analogy. The fiber went dark. GPUs are alive and there's a big scramble for them. Now, the risk here is, and you know, I have an economics background and I'm always looking for those risks. Whenever I hear the word shortage, uh I usually um believe that there's going to be a glut, an inventory glut at some point. And I'm sure there will be in the chip space. Uh but I don't think it's going to be for a long time. Uh you need to listen to Elon Musk who's talking about uh chips and power as uh you know for as far as the eye can see u being in short supply. uh and uh now that he's thinking about putting data centers into space perhaps even more so. So on this next chart this this is getting uh to investors. Um so you can see on the left here the the tech sector capital spending as a percent of GDP and you can see that it has gotten up to uh bubble days uh and that's a little bit unnerving to investors and here's why many of the most seasoned investors today um were very young when the Tekken telecom bubble took off and now they are the gray hairs uh and I'm friends with a lot of them uh and many of them are saying been there done that I'm leading uh this organization now and I'm going to protect it from this bubble uh and uh we understand that um but as I just described We have really just started this journey and we expect the capital spending cycle to go much further for much longer. Uh and uh the reason is the technologies are ready. You know uh back in the '9s we didn't get the cloud even until 2006. uh but there were visions of you know eyeballs uh uh in 10 years uh being the source of valuation today uh we didn't get the cloud till or or back then we didn't get the cloud until ' 06 we didn't get the first big breakthrough in AI until deep learning imageet in 2012 even bigger and more profound found transformer architecture in 2017 and even off of that we didn't get chat GBT the aha moment until the end of 22 early 23. So we have just begun this journey. Uh now one other difference very important you can see from this chart is the valuations today are much different than they were at the peak of the bubble. Uh so the dash line there you can see are uh that is the valuation of the mag six. Uh and you can see how crazy the valuations did get uh at a time when the technologies weren't ready and the costs were too high. Uh so the multiples being paid today are nothing like back then and in fact since this chart was done the multiples have dropped even lower uh because it is the mag six uh and and fears around what are they doing with all of this capital spending return on invested capital is going to go down that's why I own this stock uh and that's why a lot of quants or quantitative research is a little bit uh um I would say a little dangerous here uh because a lot of it's momentumdriven and here we are uh there's a great disruption taking place uh called AI and these companies must invest in it uh if they want to remain relevant and they must seize the moment uh but short-term oriented shareholders don't really want to hear that. So on this next chart, we're heading into crypto. Uh and we'll loop back to AI at the very end. Uh crypto here I think the disconnect and this is also from big ideas. Uh is hey look at what the gold price has done in the last few years and look at what's happened to Bitcoin. Uh now this is a log chart. So, um, you can see, uh, gold has had a massive move to the upside. Uh, this chart ends in at the end of 25. And of course, uh, I think last night we got down to roughly $60,000 in in Bitcoin. So, really cut in half since its peak in October. What is going on here? Isn't Bitcoin supposed to be digital gold? If it's digital gold, why isn't it behaving like gold? Uh, and a a couple of points to make here. If you do the correlation between Bitcoin and gold, their returns uh since 2019 and and I put this in uh my New Year's letter. You can see the matrix there if you'd like. Um the correlation has been 0.14. Uh one is perfect correlation. Uh and here we are at 0.14 very low almost no correlation. Uh so that is very important to understand. AI capex has hit.com levels as a percentage of GDP and Kathy Wood argues today's earnings and multiples make this a completely different situation. So Kathy borrows this line from Brad Gersonner. The GPUs are not dark. In the com era, companies laid fiber optic cable everywhere and then nobody used it. The GPU version of that would be data centers full of chips with no workloads. Every GPU that shows up gets used immediately and the companies want more. Kathy does say though as an economist whenever she hears the word shortage she starts looking for a glut. She thinks one is coming eventually in chips just not for a while. Tech capex as a percentage of GDP is back at bubble levels and that makes people nervous especially the fund managers who were young during the 2000s who are now the gray hairs running these organizations. Their instinct is protect the portfolio. We've seen this movie before. Kathy gets that, but her counter is the technology timeline. Back in the '9s, the vision was years ahead of what was possible. People didn't get cloud until 2006. Deep learning was 2012. Transformers came in 2017 and chat GBT that actually made AI useful to normal people was in late 2022. So, we've had like 3ish years of real usable AI. Her point is we're still super early. Then she gets to valuations, and this is probably the strongest part of what she's saying. During the dotcom bubble, companies traded at crazy multiples on zero earnings. Like literally no revenue. The mag six today, Meta, Apple, Nvidia, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, their multiples have actually come down over the past year because earnings keep growing faster than stock prices. These companies print cash. That is different from 1999. Now, whether current prices are reasonable for what happens next, that's still a fair debate. But if you're just looking at the spending charts and going bubble, Kathy says you need to also look at the earning charts. You can't compare one with the other. And then Bitcoin. Kathy asked the question everyone is asking. If it's digital gold, why is gold ripping to all-time highs while Bitcoin dropped to around $60 70,000? The correlation between Bitcoin and gold since 2019 is 0.14, basically zero. They don't move together. Bitcoin trades more like a risk asset. It moves with tech stocks and liquidity. Gold moves on central bank buying, geopolitical stuff, currency fields. So, comparing them side by side is kind of misleading. They're doing different things for different people. Right now, macro just happens to favor gold. Whether that flips again is another question. Now, let's jump into that bonus clip I promised you. But if you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing and I'll catch you in the next one. Now, enjoy the all-in boys. SAS companies are crashing out. $300 billion dollars of value was wiped from the S&P Tuesday in the software and data stocks category. Uh people are calling this the Claude crash. I don't know if I buy that, but on Monday, Anthropic, which has been on a bit of a heater, as we talked about, announced that they added a legal tool to Claude Co-work. If you don't know what Claude Co-work is called, this is different than the Claudebot that we talked about last week. This is a essentially what uh claude code or a coding agent is. This is for knowledge workers to automate work and do multi-step instead of just asking you a query to a large language model. It would do a number of actual actions on your behalf that you can automate and run as cron jobs as regular jobs every day, every hour, every week, whatever it happens to be. This one specifically is kind of like a plugin that allows you to do tasks uh related to legal drafts and research. What that meant to I guess retail investors and we'll get into this Brad since this is your specialtity is that a lot of legal tech startups and uh public companies were hit hard. Thompson Reuters down 20%, Lexus Nexus which is a database of case law uh was down 15%. Legal Zoom which gives legal advice um and documents down 15%. At the same time, SAS uh has continued to be negatively impacted by this concept that uh software will be made bespoke in uh tools and be wiped out. Figma down 13%, Salesforce 11, Service Now 11, Adobe 8%. And even before Tuesday's drop, and you can get into this, Brad, software was already the worst performing S&P sub section for the year. >> By the way, the numbers you report are dramatic understatement. We we've went down trillions of dollars in market cap. Figma's down 80% from the high. Uh you know, all the big names. >> Let me be clear. Those were two-day numbers. That was this week since these are two-day numbers. And that's you can give us the bigger picture. >> This is this is a real train wreck. And I was on CNBC at the start of the year, I think on January 6. Nick can can can kind of pull that up. And I was asked the question, you know, what do you think about all these stocks being down? And I said, listen, they're all down and 90% of them deserve to be down. So, let's look at these charts. Uh, David, I know this is Sachs, this is your favorite chart. You and I were looking back in 22, but now we're at an all-time low. We're we're trading at 3.9 times forward revenue. If you go to the next chart, Nick, you know, on a free cash flow multiple, also at an all-time low. So, now software is trading not just at a low on revenue, but it's trading at a low on free cash. Very profitable businesses. We've got a another slide here that I think is important which is you know when when you look at what why they're going down right they're going down and this this is for Salesforce it shows it's been cut in half in the last couple weeks but the final slide they're going down not because revenue is falling look at this revenue is actually stable to increasing for software companies revenue growth they're going down because we're discounting that future uncertainty When something as profound as AI comes along, all of a sudden it causes you to question whether or not there's as much certainty and durability in those future free cash flows. So in the case of take Salesforce, it's gone from 30 times free cash flow multiple to 15 times. That means somebody buying it today says listen, I think 15 years into the future, I can count on these free cash flows. Right? Before they were willing to pay 30 years into the future. Well, hell, with AI today, we don't know what's going to happen seven years into the future. So, for people at home to understand why are these companies hitting their numbers, but their stocks are going down, they're two totally different things, right? >> Okay. So, they're hitting their numbers, but the headwind of AI means people don't believe that they'll be strong in the future. Sax or >> Well, okay. I mean, I think there's a little bit of a handwave going on here when people say that AI is going to wipe out SAS. I I don't think that's true. You take a SAS product like Salesforce, right? It's a very large system that deals with all of your customer contacts and your revenue. You're not going to want to replace that with code that's just been spit out of a coding assistant that hasn't been fully vetted. Think about how many bug reports have been filed on Salesforce's codebase over the last 25 years, maybe millions of them. That system has been tested across thousands of large customers and enterprises. The idea that you're just going to rip out that system and replace it with code that's been probabilistically generated by an AI engine yesterday with a small team to maintain it internally just doesn't seem realistic to me. >> Picture this. A potential client searches for what your business offers and your YouTube video appears. Before they've even booked a call, they've built trust with you, turning them into a warm lead. That's why our clients are hitting $100,000 months because YouTube turns attention into authority. If you run a business, book a call and I'll show you exactly how to make this",
        "summary_hu": "A videóban Cathie Wood és más elemzők a mesterséges intelligencia (AI) növekvő gazdasági hatását és az iparági környezetet elemzik. Wood szerint a szoftverfejlesztés sohasem volt ilyen jelentős, és a vállalatok kamatoztatják az AI-ban rejlő lehetőségeket, ami indokolttá teszi a magas capital expenditure-t, amely elérheti a 660 milliárd dollárt. A Meta példáján bemutatja, hogy az AI ujraértelmezi a keresletet és a felhasználói tapasztalatokat, különösen a hirdetések terén. Az AI infrastruktúra fejlődése lassú, de tartós növekedést jövendöl. A Bitcoin piacán ellentmondások mutatkoznak, mivel az ára csökkent, teljesítménye nem tükrözi a sárga fémval fenntartott kapcsolatát. Általánosan a videó pozitív kilátásokat mutat a technológiai szektor, különösen az AI területén.",
        "summary_en": "The video analyzes the economic impact of artificial intelligence (AI) through insights from Cathie Wood and other experts. Wood argues that software development has never been more significant, and companies are capitalizing on AI opportunities, justifying high capital expenditures that could reach $660 billion. Using Meta as an example, she illustrates how AI redefines demand and user experiences, particularly in advertising. The development of AI infrastructure is slow but predicts sustained growth ahead. There are discrepancies in the Bitcoin market, as its price has dropped contrary to its expected correlation with gold. Overall, the video presents a positive outlook for the technology sector, especially in the AI domain.",
