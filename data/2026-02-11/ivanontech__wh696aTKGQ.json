    "transcript": "H.  Oh  yes.  Oh  yes.  So  yes.  Guys,  welcome   to  another  episode.  And  as  you can  see   right  now,  we  do  have  something  very   interesting  on  the  charts.  We  are   actually  having  another  flash,  another   big  fat  beautiful  flash  into  the  buy   zone.  We  haven't  really  touched  the  buy   zone  yet.  We  still  have  to  dump  a  bit   for  us  to  be  comfortable  buying  because   as  you  know,  we're  buying  here  or  below.   Let  me  actually  extend  this  buy  zone   below  so  it's  clearer  for  everyone.   We're  buying  basically  when  the  price  is   within  this  uh  rectangle.  Okay?  We're   not  buying  up  here  at  70.  We're  not   buying  even  here  at  66.  But  one  thing  I   want  to  highlight  is  that  this  week,   ever  since  Monday,  if  you  have  been   listening  carefully  and  you've  been   paying  attention  also  on  Sunday,  I  told   you  I'm  not  trusting  the  pump.  I'm  not   trusting  it.  I  told  you  the  bounce  is   super  dangerous.  I've  been  super  super   clear  that  I'm  not  willing  to  tell  you   that,  hey  guys,  you  know,  now  we're   going  to  go  up.  We're  going  to  go   bullish.  It's  a  new  bull  market.  It's  a   bottom.  No,  listen.  It's  not  what  it's   all  about.  It's  I  don't  want  to  give  you   hopeium.  Instead,  what  did  we  say?  We   say  that  we're  buying  within  the  buy   zone.  It  is  good  price,  but  we  expect   months  of  chop.  Months  and  months  of   chop.  Months  and  months  and  months.  And   this  flushing,  we  should  actually  be   using  it  to  make  money.  Each  and  every   day  I  show  you  how  our  community  is   navigating  this  time  because  there  are   very  few  communities,  guys,  that   actually  make  money  right  now.  And  we   are  maybe  one  of  the  few  ones.  I  mean   when  you  look  at  the  bull  mania  sharing   gains.  As  soon  as  we  have  a  dump,  a   proper  dump,  the  gains  start  coming.  We   have  a  sharing  gains  channel.  As  soon  as   there  is  a  move  to  the  downside,  I  see   this  bum  bum  bum  bum  bum  plus  58  plus  45   plus  100%.  Plus  28%.  And  all  of  this  as   you  can  see  it  is  short  short   short.  And  there  are  two  types  of   people.  Now,  one  type  of  people  is   buying  within  the  buy  zone  and  shorting   the  crap  out  of  the  kaka  coins.  This  is   the  winning  team.  This  is  basically  what   we're  doing.  We've  been  doing  it   forever.  I  mean,  if  you  zoom  out  here  on   our  dashboard  that  I'm  doing  every  day,   we've  been  having  massive,  massive  wins   when  the  whole  ecosystem  was  burning.  We   were  the  only  ones  who  had  massive   massive  wins.  And  so  now  that  we  have   another  flash  and  actually  we  want  to   have  a  flash.  I  mean,  when  there  is  no   flash,  there's  no  volatility.  And  the   supreme  governor  came  back  yesterday  to   our  community  said  you  know  back  from  a   long  weekend  let's  short  some  kaka  coins   and  today  I  think  he  posted  his  win   here.  Yeah yeah yeah  look  here  103%   shorting  shorting  bitcoin  [laughter]   and  as  long  as  there  is  volatility  we   are  making  bank.  Okay  I  I  wrote   yesterday  we  need  a  flash.  We  need  a   flash.  We  need  a  flash  as  soon  as   possible.  And  the  flash  is  happening   right  now.  So  as  long  as  you  know  what   we're  dealing  with.  This  is  not  news  to   you.  As  long  as  you've  been  part  of  the   streams  by  the  way  subscribe.  Welcome  if   you're  new.  you  should  subscribe.   Otherwise,  you're  following  people  who   are  themselves  blind.  I  mean,  if  you're   following  someone  blind,  it  is  the  blind   leading  the  blind.  If  you  are  so-called   group  leader  has  been  telling  you  buy   the  deep  hole,  business  cycle,  ISM,   other  crap,  you're  mega  wrecked.  But   it's  okay  because  new  cycle  is  coming.   You  can  make  a  lot  of  money  here  as   well.  So,  you  should  subscribe  as  soon   as  possible.  Smash  up  the  like  if  you   appreciate  this  kind  of  content.  And   looking  at  where  we  are  now  for  Bitcoin,   guys.  We  are  going  into  the  buy  zone.   here  is  okay  to  DCA  but  DCA  slowly  DCA   slow  don't  DCA  fast  here  we  DCA  slowly   when  we  see  the  bull  flip  happen  we  DCA   way  faster  way  way  faster  here  is  just   know  nibble  a  bit  so  you  you  can  you   have  bitcoin  you  know  buy  price  here  at   60  long  term  is  going  to  be  very  good   price  but  remember  we  can  go  down  way   lower  someone  asked  me  know  how  low  can   we  go  in  our  in  our  community  in  the   bullman  community  where  is  it  where  is   where  is  where  is  where  is  it  here  here   here  u  uh  honeypie  asks  great  report.  Uh   you  mentioned  likelihood  of  Bitcoin   going  lower  than  60K.  How  low  you  think   it  will  go?  And  I  said,  listen,  I  don't   know.  And  also,  I  don't  care  how  low  it   will  go.  It  could  go  30%  below  the  200   week  moving  average,  but  it  doesn't   matter  because  we  start  DCA  from  60K  and   we  DCA  very  slowly,  okay?  And  once  the   money  line  flips  bullish,  we  da  faster.   I  mean,  whatever  happens,  we  literally   don't  care.  I  mean,  listen,  we  literally   don't  care  at  all  what  happens   otherwise.  Okay?  And  that  that's  how  it   should  be.  It  goes  up,  it  goes  down.   Great.  We're  not  forcing  ourselves  to  be   right  quickly.  We  don't  need  to  be  right   quickly  here.  As  long  as  Bitcoin  is  60,   it's  good  average  price,  you  can  DCA,   but  you  should  know  that  it  can  still  go   to  40.  It  can  easily  go  to  40.  Uh,  but   it's  okay  because  we're  DCAing  slowly.   And  um,  uh,  to  be  detailed,  people  want   me  to  be  detailed.  25%  of  the  tri  powder   I  intend  to  buy  Bitcoin  with,  I  DCA   slowly  within  the  buy  zone,  like  once   each  and  every  few  weeks,  not  fast  at   all,  like  1%  at  a  time  basically.  Then   once  the  bull  flip  happens  basically  we   go  into  the  bull  trend  and  this  is  this   bull  trend  flip  it  is  going  down  a  lot.   So  soon  is  going  to  be  that  you  know  we   need  to  go  above  70  and  is  bullish  or   65.  I  mean  this  thing  is  going  to  come   down  very  very  quickly  down  then  the   other  75%  will  come  into  the  game.  So   that's  the  current  plan.  And  I  mean  I  I   hope  guys  you're  excited  for  the  flash.   Personally  I'm  very  excited  for  the   flash.  I  want  all  of  the  coins  to  get  to   their  targets  because  that's  where  we   make  the  most  money  now.  Shorting,  it's   the  best.  Currently,  it  is  the  best.  The   alternative  is  you're  a  holder  and   you're  praying.  You're  praying  to  God,   please  don't  break  down.  Sana,  please   don't  break  down.  Sana,  please  don't   break  down.  Please  don't  break  down.   Please  don't  flash.  Please  don't  flash.   What  happens?  Sana  flashes.  I  mean,  Sana   is  coming  to  Papa.  It's  right  here  at   $30.  It's  hitting  the  flash  button.  And   so,  what  what  what  team  you  want  to  be   on?  Because  whoever  you  follow,  whoever   you  pay  attention,  you  are  being  put   into  a  team.  Are  you  in  the  playable   loser  team  or  are  you  in  the  winning   team?  Okay,  that's  my  only  question  to   you.  And  be  honest  here.  To  be  honest   here,  don't  tell  me,  \"Oh,  Ivan,  but  I   see  the  big  picture.  You  don't  see  the   big  Listen,  what  do  you  speak  about?\"  As   soon  as  As  soon  as  we're  bullish,  we're   going  to  buy  also.  We're  going  to  buy   cheaper  than  you  are  holding.  Like   people  think  if  I  huddle  down  90%,  then   I'm  more  worthy  and  I'm  more  deserving   of  the  pump.  Like  they  think  like  this.   This  is  sick  thinking.  It's  a  thick  like   mental  hospital  kind  of  thinking  because   we  on  the  other  hand  as  soon  as  the  bull   trend  is  is  green  we're  also  in.  So   we're  basically  buying  buying  at  the   lows  close  to  the  lows.  We  never  buy  at   the  low.  It's  impossible.  It's   impossible.  We're  buying  at  the  low   while  the  mentally  uh  mentally  crazy   guys  they're  thinking  that  they're   somehow  holy.  They  roundtrip  the  whole   thing  and  now  they  deserve  and  no  one   else  but  everyone  else  just  buys  when   when  it  flips.  Well,  not  everyone   because  most  people  are  this,  you  know,   a  bit  mentally.  Uh,  very  few  people  do.   I  mean,  if  you  are  in  Bulman,  you  do.   Otherwise,  you're  in  big  big big   trouble.  But  guys,  yeah,  Solana,  it  goes   to  the  target  here.  Okay,  does  have  to   go  all  the  way  down.  I  don't  know  if   it's  going  to  go  all  the  way  down,  but   it's  the  target.  It's  the  target,  man.   If  you  love  Sana,  you  you  just  DCA  in   once  we  flip  bullish  and  this  thing,   guys,  watch  watch  the  next  weekly  open.   I  think  Sana  bull  flip  is  going  to  drop   maybe  to  100.  I  mean,  now  it's  130,  but   you  know,  it's  uh  it's  also  going  to  go   down  a  lot  a  lot.  So,  if  you  want  to   have  super  safety,  you  just  wait  for   this  thing  to  flip  bullish  and  then  you   buy  just  like  we  did  all  the  way  uh  all   the  way  here  in  uh  2023  January.  I  mean,   this  was  this  was  the  best  riskreward   best.  You  see  how  how  fast  the  bull  flip   falls.  Once  we  fall,  it  falls  very  very   fast.  And  so,  if  you  can  buy  the  new   bull  flip  is  the  best  or  if  you  think   that  it's,  you  know,  good  price  at  40  at   30,  do  it  also.  I  don't  know if  it's   going to  go  to  30,  guys,  but  it's  the   target.  It's  the  target.  Uh  it's  the   target  and  it's  being  magnetized   magnetized  to  30.  And  that's  exactly   exactly  where  uh  we  said  it's  going  to   go.  Next,  uh  XRP  is  getting  magnetized   towards  0.7.  I  mean,  the  week  is  just   continuing  exa  exactly.  Can  I  say  that   guys?  Can  I  say  that?  Exactly  as   predicted.  Is  it  okay  for  me  to  say   exactly  as  predicted?   I  mean  there  is  an  argument  to  be  made   how  much  how  much  humble  I  should  be  and   how  much  I  should  be  taking.  that  I   listen  I  want  to  be  as  humble  as   possible  at  the  same  time  I  want  to   fully  communicate  to  you  how  amazing  the   mechanical  rules  and  our  system  has  been   so  I  can  save  you  so  it  is  actually  in   your  best  interest  that  I  am  as  loud  and   and  obnoxious  as  possible  when  it  comes   to  taking  credit  otherwise  I  mean  most   people  they  don't  get  it  and  then  they   go  and  they  tell  me  I  have  a  business   cycle  I  mean  listen  I  if  you  don't  get   it  you  don't  get  I  have  to  be  clear  I   have  to  be  clear  I  have  to  be  absolutely   absolutely  clear  so  guys  if  you  want  to   join  the  winning  team  what  Do  you  do?

So   that's  the  plan  for  us  now  to  be  on  the   short  side.  Look  here.  Bob  Lucas.  I  love   Bob  Lucas.  I  mean,  you  know,  people   don't  respect  Bob  Lucas  sometimes.  I   hear  I  read  his  comments  when  he  said   that  it's  time  to  be  conservative  in  Q4   and  so  much  hate.  I  mean  just  like  we   said  in  October  8th  October  8th  we  said   to  Dis  so  much  hate  so  much  hate  but  I   mean  he's  been  pretty  spot  on.  He's  been   actually  exactly  spot  on  just  like  we   have  been.  So  go  and  follow  Bob  Lucas  is   great.  I  mean  he's  amazing.  Just  about   every  crypto  chart  is  in  deep  bare  mode.   So  you  short  short  short.  If  you  don't   know  how  to  short  go  to  bulmia.com.  If   you  are  afraid  to  short  go  still  to   bull.com.  Learn  the  mechanical  rules.   Don't  be  afraid.  Like  people  are  afraid   because  they  don't  know  what  they're   doing.  I  understand  you're  afraid.  First   time  you  open  a  math  book,  you  don't   know  what  2  plus  2  is.  Ivan  explains  to   you  what  is  2  plus  2?  What  is  5*  3?  I   can  explain  to  everything.  So  shorting   is  kind  of  the  same.  If  you  have  never   done  it,  you  don't  know  the  mechanical   rules.  I  understand  you're  afraid.  Maybe   you  even  tried  it  and  got  wrecked   because  you  don't  have  stop  loss.  You   don't  have  risk  calculation.  You  don't   have  position  sizing.  So  you  need   mechanical  rules  basically.  Look  here.   But  look  guys,  just  about  every  crypto   chart  is  deep,  deep  bare  mode.  And   that's  exactly  how  we  love  it  right  now.   still  a  decent  amount  of  denial  from   permabulls.  I  mean,  they're  they  are  the   blind  leading  the  blind.  If  you  are  if   you  are,  you  know,  group  leader,  your   influencer  is  permabull,  I  feel  so  sorry   for  you  guys.  Maybe  next  time  you're   going  to  have  better  execution,  but  it's   been  very  bad.  Uh,  and  by  the  way,  let   me  let  me  digress  a  bit.  Look  here.   Sailor,  eight  years  of  DCA  and  Hodal  big   big  loss.  Trump  after  one  year  of  memes   and  so-called  DeFi,  I  mean  whatever  he   calls  DeFi,  this  world  liberty  financial   big   Trump  reports  3.4  billion  in  just  16   months  in  revenue.  [laughter]  Okay,  I   thought  it's  fine  but  I  mean  you  need  to   have  a  strategy  here.  Now  Trump's   strategy  is  based  on  the  political   connection  likely  because  look  here   Binance  the  CZ  guy  as  you  know  he  is  now   holding  87%  of  Trump's  stable  coin.  And   I  mean,  Binance  is  doing  that.  The   Forbes,  I  don't  know if  it  is  fake  news   or  not.  I  mean,  they're  trying  to  make   it  look  like  corruption,  but  at  the  same   time,  normally  Binance  is  the  biggest   holder  of  most  coins  because  that's   where  people  deposit  the  coin.  And  so,   it  looks  like  Binance  holds  them,  but   it's  just  user  deposits.  I'm  not  too   sure  exactly  here  what  it  means,  but   also  it  wouldn't  surprise  me  if  there  is   some  kind  of  business  going  on  between   [snorts]   CZ  and  Trump.  I  mean,  he  got  the   paradon,  and  we  are  in  a  we  need  to  be   in  a  pragmatic  world.  I  mean,  how  do  you   get  pardon?  Do  you  need  to  maybe  do  a   bit  of  business  with  Trump?  I  mean,  why   not?  Probably  it  is  like  that.  Is  it   corruption?  I  mean,  probably.  But  that's   how  the  world  works.  I  mean,  I'm  sorry.   The  world  is  not  a  freaking  fairy  tale.   I'm  sorry.  It's  not  white  and  fluffy   like  a  rabbit.  Like  a  rabbit.  The  life   is  not  like  that.  I  mean,  one  of  the   first  things  you  should  teach  your   child,  world  is  unfair,  man.  It's   unfair.  It's  very  unfair.  So,  it   wouldn't  surprise  me  either  if  they  have   a  lot  a  lot  a  lot  of  like  Trump  coin  and   he  bought  a  lot  to  get  them  to  get   poured  on.  So,  let's  see  what's  going  to   happen.  But  you  need  to  have  some  kind   of  strategy.  Just  huddle,  huddle  down   90%,  80%  is  very  bad.  Especially  when  it   comes  to  uh  altcoins  in  Bitcoin,  it's   still  going  to  be  okay.  Like  you're   going  to  have  terrible  uh  life  if  you   hodddle  just  huddle  huddle  with  money   you  cannot  afford  to  lose.  Why?  Because   it  goes  down  80%.  You  have  so  much   stress.  Your  cortisol  level  goes  up.  Uh   it's  very  bad.  Like  your  sleep  is  bad.   Your  family  relation  breaks  down  because   you're  depressed.  So  you  know  that's  the   dark  side  that  the  dark  side  of  huddle.   And  it's  way  better  for  most  people  to   follow  the  mechanical  rules.  Go  to   bullying.com  to  learn  because  then   you're  part  of  the  upside  and  then   you're  not  part  of  the  downside.  I  mean,   why  if  you  can  be  like  that,  why  not?   And  you  can  also  beat  it  in  most  assets.   And  you  can  also  short  it  on  the  way   down.  It's  the  best.  And  you  never  lose   uh  lose  big  like  I  keep  showing  you  guys   in  Bulmania.  We  never  have  big  losses.   We  we  have  losses.  I  mean,  losses  is   part  of  trading,  but  they  always  look   like  this.  They  always  look  like  this   because  mechanical  rules  ensure  that  you   always  have  risk  defined  and  you're   stopped  out  before  small  mistakes  turn   into  big  disasters.  If  you  follow   mechanical  rules,  that's  the  result.   Okay,  but  anyway,  back  to  Bob  Lucas.   Look  here,  it's  just  a  process  down.  He   says  selffulfilling   and  takes  time,  so  stay  patient.  I  mean,   what  we've  been  saying  as  well,  it  can   still  it  can  take  months  to  chop  out  a   bottom  here.  Bottoms  are  chopped  out,   guys.  Normally  they're  not  V-shaped  and   it's  it's  a  big  exception  when  you  have   V-shaped.  It's  a  very  big  exception.  I   know  many  people  have  experienced  the   Vshape  in  the  COVID  era  and  they  hope   for  the  same  now.  But  I  need  to  be   honest  with  you  like  it's  it's  more  of   an  exception  than  the  rule  that  you  have   Vshape.  Normally  it's  grind.  It's  grind.   It's  grind  and  grind  like  to  focus  on   preparing  for  a  bottom  versus  focusing   on  finding  short-term  opportunities.  Um   yeah,  I  mean  now  you  can  short  for   example  short-term  opportunity  should   expect  one  really  solid  counter  trend   move  between  now  and  eventual  bottom.  I   expect  the  bottom  comes  with  equities   pushing  down  hard  at  some  point  in  2026.   And  that's  yes  that's  the  big  overhang.   What  the  hell  are  the  stocks  going  to   do?  Because  the  stock  market  now  I  mean   guys  I'm  not  a  fan  that  it  does  not  do   an  all-time  high.  I'm  not  a  fan  that  is   kind  of  tiptoe  around  alltime  high.  I  I   mean  I  get  nervous  when  I  see  this.  I   personally  get  a  bit  nervous.  I  wanted   to  be  very  confident  and  I  wanted  to  do   a  big  fat  alltime  high  with  clarity   because  this  just  looks  like  losing   momentum.  Now  it's  still  around  all  so   at  any  day  we  can  have  a  candle  like   this.  But  that's  what  we  need.  Like   that's  the  confirmation  that  stones  are   going  to  pump  and  maybe  they're  going  to   go  up  another  20%  before  they  look  back.   But  now  it  is  like  you  know  they're   trying  here.  They  tried  last  week  they   tried.  This  week  they  tried  and  got  put   back  in  their  place.  So  I'm  not  really  a   big  fan  of  how  this  looks  like.  I  would   love  for  stocks  to  go  and  do  actual   alltime  high  real  alltime  high.  But  if   they  don't  like  if  we  see  a  rejection   basically  at  this  level  uh  let  me  do  it   properly.  If  we  see  a  rejection  at  this   level  uh  then  yeah  we  can  easily  go  down   10%.  We  can  have  uh  I  mean  something   like  this  something  like  this  at  the   least  at  the  least  just  to  test  the  bull   trend.  It's  not  even  that  big  of  a  fall.   That's  why  I  say  at  the  least  imagine   what's  going  to  happen  to  Bitcoin  if   stocks  go  down  5%.  It's  not  going  to  be   pretty.  Imagine  what's  going  to  happen   to  like  your  [ __ ]  It's  not  going  to   be  pretty.  But  also  there  is  a   likelihood  that  we  go  down  more.  We  can   easily  go  down  10%  also.  Let's  put  in   some  moving  averages.  Let's  see  where  we   may  may  see  some  uh  some  support  like  if   we  see  a  more  prolonged  kind  of  uh  draw   down  like  a  multi  multimonth  what  what   would  what  would  have  to  happen  like   just  going  to  50  moving  average  which   the  stock  market  does  all  the  time  would   be  8%.  And  uh  yeah  we  did  it  last  year.   here  for  example  go  back  to  50  week  then   we  fell  to  two  uh  lower  as  well  which   one  is  it  it's  100  week  then  we  fell  to   100  week  also  and  we  almost  fell  to  200   so  all  of  this  can  happen  easily  in  the   stock  market  and  of  course  we  need  to  be   prepared  for  that  and  uh  that's  why  in   the  buy  zone  while  we  see  while  we  can   value  Bitcoin  as  a  fair  price  in  the  buy   zone  guys  we're  not  like  drinking   Kool-Aid  here  uh  within  the  buy  zone  we   know  that  it  can  easily  go  lower  that's   why  we  just  nibble  a  bit.  We  allow   ourselves  time  to  uh  for  this  to  be  in   profit.  Like  this  this  buys  here  at  60,   they're  going  to  be  great  buys.  Like   long  term  in  a  year,  you're  going  to   think,  man,  60  was  so  cheap.  You're   going  to  think  60  is  amazing.  But  in  the   meanwhile,  it  can  easily  go  to  40.  It   can  go  lower  as  well.  So  I  just  want  you   to  see  the  undervaluation  that  we're   that  we  are  in.  If  we  are  close  to  200E   moving  average,  it  is  true   undervaluation.  But  at  the  same  time   like  Bob  Lucas  is  saying  we  need  to  chop   out  the  bottom.  It's  not  easy  to  do.  It   takes  months.  So  uh  be  prepared.  I  mean   be  prepared  for  that  also.  In  the   meanwhile  many  altcoins  guys  are  still   uh  at  the  two  too  big  valuation  uh  chart   is  looking  too  ugly  and  the  big   opportunity  is  to  short  the  crap  or  buy   low  when  they  actually  reach  the  target   or  close  to  the  target.  So  we  mentioned   Sana,  we  mentioned  the  XRP  both  uh  I   mean  this  is  the  Bison  XRP  0.7.  Uh  then   let's  see  BNB  what's  happening  there.  I   mean  BNB  is  also  similar  as  you  can  see   it  broke  the  uh  support  here  and  then   boom  boom  boom  boom  collapses  like  a   freaking  cow  to  this  uh  uh  to  this  level   right  here.  By  the  way  BNB  is  is  soon   going  to  hit  our  our  target  here  that  we   did  a  few  weeks  back.  And  uh  yeah  500   and  of  course  if  Bitcoin  keeps  going   lower  this  thing  is  also  going  to  go   lower.  And  let's  say  I  mean  we  reach   this  level  so  quick  now.  So  we  almost   need  to  draw  another  one  for  BNB.  If  it   starts  losing  this  uh  support  uh  around   like  550  then  we  go  to  350.  Maybe  we   need  to  revisit  350.  It  can  easily  do   that.  I  mean  listen  most  coins  they  go   they  go  down  to  their  2023  levels.  Most   coins  do  that.  You  look  at  Avox  is  the   worst  example  but  it  actually  goes  to   like  lows.  It  goes  to  lows  of  2023.  BNB   from  that  perspective  still  has  a  lot  to   lose.  I  mean,  for  it  to  go  to  lows,  and   I'm  not  saying  BNB  is  going  to  do  that   because  it's  Binance.  They  can  kind  of   make  their  own  price,  but  that's  65%   down.  That's  another  65%  down  for  BNB.   Uh,  so  that's  where  the  path  of  least   resistance  is  currently.  Okay,  it's   currently  there.  Suie,  let's  see  what's   happening  to  SUI.  The  business  cycle,   where  is  the  business  cycle,   man?  Yeah,  it's  kind  of  getting  to  our   to  our  target  here  at  0.5.  It  is  the   target.  It  is.  And  it  can  easily  also   break  that  and  go  into  uh  price   discovery.  Well,  not  really  yet.  See,  if   it  breaks  that,  it  has  another  target   here  at  0.38.  And  then  it's  price   discovery  to  the  to  the  downside.  And  of   course,  people  listening  to  this  may  be   saying,  \"Ivan,  but  you  know,  you  sound   so  bearish.  It's  so  bearish.\"  You  know,   maybe  it's  a  sign  that  it's  a  bottom.  If   you  use  that  argument,  you've  been  using   that  argument  against  me  since  October,   man.  Oh,  Ivan  is  bearish.  It  means  it's   the  B,  man.  I  mean,  is  that  a  strategy?   [laughter]   I  mean,  I  wish  you  luck.  I  wish  you  the   best.  I  I  pray  for  you  a  bit  also.  I   mean,  honestly,  honestly,  because  you   really  need  it.  You  need  it  a  lot.  So,   I'm  a  positive  person.  I  give  off   positive  energy.  I  wish  you  all  the  best   in  your  trading  and  all  the  luck  in  your   trading  because  you  really  need  it.  Some   people  need  it  less.  I  mean,  we  have   people  in  our  discord,  they  need  it   less.  Look  at  the  Supreme  Governor.  He   is  uh  he  really  got  the  mechanical  rules   because  he's  posting  like  massive  gains   every  day.  And  I  asked  him  to  share  his   losses.  The  only  thing  he  shared  is  like   this  because  he  he  really  knows  the   mechan.  So  he  needs  less  luck.  You  need   a  lot,  man.  You  need  a  lot.  You  need   like  a  truckload  of  luck.  If  you're  say   telling  me,  Ivan,  you're  so  bearish,  it   means,  man,  you  need  a  truckload.  Oh,   Ivan,  you're  going  to  miss  when  it   pumps.  Then  you  don't  even  know  the  my   strategy.  You  don't  understand  the  trend   traing.  You  don't  understand  that  as   soon  as  the  trend  is  bull,  we're  back   in.  We  our  average  price  is  going  to  be   amazing  while  you're  holding  your   [ __ ]  down  90%.  So,  you  need  a   truckload,  boatload,  you  know,  Godzilla   kind  of  amounts  of  luck,  okay?  And  and   and  I'm  generous  to  to  give  it  to  you   and  wish  it  to.  Okay?  [laughter]   So,  that's  that.  Uh,  next  guys,  SEC  SEC   is  dropping  cases  left  and  right.  Does   this  has  something  to  do  with  Trump   having  a  lot  of  revenue  in  his  cryptos?   Who  the  hell  knows?  Maybe  this,  maybe   that,  but  SEC  now  is  dropping  lawsuit   against  Winklas.  Did  Winkle  Was   contribute  to  this  gain  somehow  in   Trump?  Uh,  I  don't  know.  No  one  knows.   But  the  lawsuit  is  gone.  It  is  gone.  And   that's  great  for  Winkle  Was  SEC  in   general,  they've  been  very,  very  good   now.  They've  been  dropping  all  lawsuits   for  crypto  and  that's  exactly  exactly   how  we  like  it.  How  we  like  it.  We  want   less  lawsuit,  not  more  in  crypto.  The   the  less  the  better.  Guys,  let's  go  to   Q&A,  questions,  answers,  debates,   discussions.  Let's  go  as  soon  as   possible.  I  I  normally  I  say  big  shout   out  to  time  stamper  but  today  we  don't   have  we  don't  have  maybe  Guzman  or   someone  or  um  or  will  I  don't know  we'll   have  you  ever  time  stamp  uh  if  if  any   time  stamp  if  you  guys  are  watching  in   uh  recording  then  uh  feel  free  to  time   stamp  big  shout  to  you  then  otherwise   guys  let's  go  to  Q&A  and  what  you  have   to  do  you  have  to  do  two  important   things  well  actually  many  important   things  but  number  one  smash  up  the  like   so  that's  the  easiest  number  two   subscribe  also  easiest  bell  button  very   easy  next  you  go  to  bullmania.com  and   You  watch  the  free  training  if  you   haven't  yet  for  mechanical  rules  and   then  you  go  to  bulmia.com/partners   here  exchanges  I  use  and  you  get  to  this   page  and  just  collect  you  need  to  be   like  a  freaking  uh  vacuum  vacuum   collecting  freebies  right  now  if  you   have  buy  okay  go  Pionex  go  Bitun  collect   collect  vacuum  vacuum  this  industry  uh   for  the  freebie  okay  that's  it  that's  it   guys  let's  go  to  Q&A  questions  answers   debates  discussions  let's  go  as  soon  as   soon  as  possible   Yo  Will,  I've  timestamped  twice.  I'm   trying  today,  but  the  time  is  throwing.   It's  okay.  It's  okay,  man.  Don't  worry.   Don't  worry.  Don't  worry.  Time  stamping   on.  Don't  Don't  worry,  bro.  Don't  worry.   Don't  worry.   Do  best  effort.  I  mean,  you  can  if  we   just  have  five  time  stamps,  it's  it's   enough.  You  can  have  like  intro.  Ivan   speaks  about  [ __ ]  Ivan  speaks  about   Bulmania.  Ivan  speaks  like  No,  just  five   is  enough.  It  doesn't  have  to  be  like   too  granular.   Let's  short  uh  piping.  Yeah,  I  mean  as   long  as  it's  bearish  short  short.  It's  a   with  mechanical  rules  with  a  stop  loss.   Fantastic.  Fantastic.  Fantastic.   Define  a  bare  market.  I  I  love  that   question  because  it's  I  don't  like  the  I   mean  I  love  that  you  ask  it  because  I   can  say  that  the  question  is  bad.  Okay,   you  know  define  the  bare  market  where   your  scope  is  is is  bearish.  Okay,  but   don't  put  yourself  don't  corner   yourself.  You  know,  are  we  in  bare   market?  Are  we  not  in  bare  market?   Normally  most  people  when  they  when  they   think  it's  bare  market  it's  always  bull   market  [laughter]  you  know  most  uh  perma   bulls  they  kind  of  give  give  up  when   it's  the  bottom  you  know  so  don't  don't   worry  too  much  is  it  bare  is  it  bull  you   just  put  this  you  know  thinking  which  is   not  not  great  it's  not  it's  not  too   great  instead  we  look  at  trend  so  now   bitcoin  is  in  bull  trend  we're  below  50   week  we're  below  100  week  uh  on  the   daily  we  went  bearish  already  here  in   October  So  think  like  that  instead.   Think  like  that.  Don't  don't don't   corner  yourself.  You  you  need  to  know   which  trend  we're  in  because  here's  the   problem  when  you  say  that  we're  in  bare   market  and  yes  I  mean  now  we're  we  are   in  bare  market  but  the  problem  is  that   you  then  get  a  bunch  of  assumptions  with   it.  You  know  the  bare  market  needs  to  be   like  this.  The  bare  market  never  does   this.  Like  some  people  say  oh  but  but  I   mean  in  the  bare  market  we  never  do  this   like  they  have  some  kind  of  idea  what   the  bare  market  is.  So  yes  it  is  bare   trend.  That's  the  only  thing  you  need  to   worry  about.  don't  worry  about  you  know   bare  market  because  of  like  500  criteria   you  know  in  the  last  bare  market  people   said  that  bitcoin  in  bare  market  never   goes  below  the  previous  all-time  high   and  then  we  did  so  uh  yeah  don't  don't   make  your  life  too  complex  like  for   example  you  remember  here  we  had  an   all-time  high  here  back  in  20  uh  2017  uh   here  and  people  said  I  I  bare  markets   they  never  go  below  the  previous  alltime   high  they  never  never  go  and  yeah  and  we   went  below  And  we  were  holding  it,  we   were  holding  it,  we  were  holding  it,  we   were  hold  and  boom,  we  went  below.  So  as   long  as  you  don't  bring  a  bunch  of  wrong   assumptions  uh  a  bunch  of  wrong  uh  ideas   about  what  bare  market  is  and  is  not,   what  it  should  do,  what  it  should  not   do,  then  you  can  define  it  as  we're  in  a   bad  trend,  we're  below  the  50.  Okay.  And   uh  that  can  be  a  good  quite  good   definition.  And  when  50  week  is  working   as  resistance,  I  mean  now  we  haven't   even  tried  to  get  to  it.  I  mean  it's  uh   it's  been  quite  weak.  uh  but  that  that's   like  a  classic  definition  but  then   everything  else  that  you  may  have  you   know  pi  cycle  top  indicator  or  I  don't   know  nupal  chart  or  whatever  people  have   where  are  this  you  know  bitcoin  top   indicators   you  see  if  you  define  uh  bare  market   based  on   based  on  this  uh  sorry  to  say  but  it  is   gar  like  it's  it's  not  good  like  it's   not  good  and  I  know  in  the  past  we've   been  speaking  about  this  kind  of  kind  of   stuff  also  but  it's  uh  it's  been  proven   over  and  over  again  to  not  really  work.   So  now  we  just  look  at  the  chart  whether   you  know  some  rainbow  chart  fuel   multiple   ETF  to  BT  bubble  index  Bitcoin  dominance   uh  four  yeah  I  mean  some  of  it  is  okay   like  four  year  moving  average  is   basically  the  200  week  moving  average  we   look  at  that  you  know  all  of  this   terminal  price  terminal  price  uh  okay   golden  ratio  smiths  on  forecast  oh  my   god  yeah  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh  none  of  them  are   hit  and  Bitcoin  is  down  50%.  And  most   alcoins  are  down  90%.  I   guess  yeah,  it's  uh   business  cycle.  Yes.  See  yourself.   So  as  long  as  you  don't  bring  this   mental  illness  into  your  definition  of   the  uh  bare  market,  then  okay,  you  can   you  can  use  the  concept  of  a  bare   market,  but  use  it  just  based  on  the   price  chart.  Everything  else  is  fugazi.   It  doesn't  work.  It's  not  it's  not  a   consistent  way  of  trading.  You  can  uh   super  super  exactly  super  super  it's  not   a  consistent  way  of  trading.  I  mean  okay   based  on  all  of  this  what  strategy  do   you  do?  How  do  you  make  your  entry?  See   in  mechanical  rules  we  tell  you  how  to   uh  what  to  buy  like  mechanical  rules.  If   you  know  the  mechanical  rules  if  you  go   to  bullman.com  you you  watch  the  free   video  you  and  you  join  the  bullman  you   know  the  mechanical  rules.  You  know  what   to  buy.  you  always  know  what  to  buy,  how   to  buy  it.  That's  another  important   thing.  Most  people  just  go  all  in  is   wrong.  How  to  buy  it?  Uh  then  uh  how  to   sell,  when  to  sell  and  how  to  sell,  what   to  sell,  when  to  sell,  how  to  sell.  Most   people  just  uh  exit  everything  very   wrong.  And  so  when  you  have  this,  you   can  be  like  I  show  you  the  guys  in  our   in  our  community,  big  wins,  small   losses.  You're  always  going  to  have  some   losses.  It's  a  probabilistic  game.  So   big  wins,  small  losses.  Okay?  Otherwise   like  let's  say  you  based  on  this  how  do   you  do  position  size  how  do  you  do  risk   calculation  how  do  you  do  it's   impossible  it's  okay  p  multiple  now  is   70  what  do  you  do  you  take  a  position  or   what   okay  let's  say  you  you  trade  on  pure   multiple  you  enter  position  the  the  damn   thing  doesn't  even  okay  you  set  a  stop   loss  also  based  on  it  when  it  goes  down   like  how  you  do  it  I  don't  understand  so   it's  um  yeah  I  don't  understand  so   that's  why  it's  uh  not  too  great  to  use   anything  except  the  mechanical  rules  You   cannot  be  in  the  winning  team  otherwise.   I  mean  it  is  how  it  is.   Sideways  chop  is  death.  Rather  go   sideway  sorry  rather  go  down.  Yes  I   agree.  I  agree.  I  agree.  I  I I  love  the   flash  man.  The  flash  is  better  than  the   sideways.  And  I  know  also  that  is  good   for  the  bulls  because  once  we  finally   flash  down  we  can  build  a  bottom  and  go   up.  If  we  go  too  much  sideways  it's  not   good.  It's  not  good.  It's  just  bleeding.   It's  painful.  You  have  more  depression   in  your  life  if  you're  a  bull.  If  you're   a  bear,  you  cannot  short.  You  can  do   just  pionx  boss  basically.  But  it's  also   like  it's  not  um  it's  not  as  good  as   when  it  pumps  or  dumps.  We  need  pump  or   dump.  Okay,  that's  that's  the  best  when   it's  chop  is  just  sleepy  market.  I  mean   it's  better  to  trade  something  else  than   like  stocks  or  something.  You  don't  want   chop  you  and  it's  very  important  when  it   is  chop.  You  don't  want  to  trade.  Very   important  when  it's  chop.  Ideally,  you   want  to  be  just  chilling  just  like  you   know  when  we  had  this  uh  sideways  here.   I  told  you  it's  like  it's  mainly  a  no   trade  zone.  Like  what  what  you  going  to   do  here?  You're  going  to  long,  you're   going  to  short.  What  are  you  going  to   do?  Like  both  both  ways  you're  going  to   get  stopped  out.  Long  or  short.  Like   there's  no  way  to  be  right  here.  There's   no  way  to  be  right  when  it's  like  this.   You  need  to  have  momentum.  Once  it  broke   down,  the  party  started.  The  feast   started.  The  feast  started  here.  And  I   can  clearly  see  in  real  time  how  our   community  is  doing  because  the  winds   when when  did  we  start  breaking  down?   Like  October.  Sorry.  February  like  5th   or  when  was  it?  When  was  it?  Yeah.  I   mean  the  the  feast  started  the  feast   started  like  no  tomorrow  as  soon as  we   started  to  break  down.  I  don't  like  chop   guys.  I  mean  chop  and  you  should  not   like  it  either.  Some  people  like  oh  no   we're  maybe  we're  going  to  go  up.  I  I   know  it's  a  bit  of  comfort  if  you  are  uh   held  by  the  balls  by  the  bear.  It's  a   bit  of  comfort.  Oh  no  it's  up  a  bit.   It's  up  a  bit.  You  feel  good.  You  know   like  I  told  you  the  other  day  bird  is   chirping.  It's  up  a  bit.  A  bit  of  a   green  day.  On  the  hourly  chart  you're   green.  On  the  daily  chart  you're  a  bit   green.  On  the  five  minute  chart  you're   green.  It  feels  good.  But  it's  an   illusion,  guys.  It's  an  illusion  because   we're  not  going  to  go  up  anyway.  It's   just,  you  know,  you  prolong  your  fate.   You  prolong  your  destiny  of  mega   wreckage.  If  you  just  hodddle  down  uh   and  diamond  hunt  down,  you  just  prolong   your  faith.  Why  do  you  want  to  do  that?   If  you  if  you  don't  understand  the   mechanical  rules  and  and  how  to  trade,   you  would  rather  go  down  fast  and  then   build  a  bottom  and  go  up  fast.  So  that's   why  for  everyone,  it's  good  that  we  go   down  to  to  the  buy  zone  into  the  buy   zone.  If  you  have  money,  you  can  buy   cheap.  If  you  just  huddle  down,  it's   also  good  for  you  because  the  faster   we're  here,  the  faster  we  get  out  of   here.  Okay,  so  that's  it.  That's  it.   It's  kind  [snorts]  of  like,  you  know,   when  you  are  I  had  an  analogy.  I  don't   think  it's  going  to  be  good.   Old  seasons.  I'm  asking  you.  You'll  have   to  wait  a  bit  more.  You  We're  gonna  have   a  big  old  season.  big  fat  old  season  but   uh  not  yet.  Not  yet.  Not  yet.   Give  analogy.  I  I  I  don't  even  uh  I  I  my   brain  didn't  even  fully  complete  it.  I   was  going  to  do  some  analogy  with   workout.   What  was  I  thinking?  You  know  sometimes   when  workout  is   forget  forget  forget  forget  forget.  If  I   have  a  banger  analogy,  I  I  I  know  it   this  one  is  not  good.  I  only  want  to   give  you  banger  analogies,  okay?  In  real   time.  [laughter]   Oh  yeah.   The  longer  the  sideways,  the  higher  the   pump.  I  mean,  yeah.  Ideally,  we  want  a   nice  sideways.  Nice  good  sideways.  Okay.   I  mean,  what  jobs  do  you  think  are  going   to  be  safe  in  the  future?  Holy  crap.  I   don't  know,  guys.  is  really  it's  so  hard   to  predict  like  with  AI  it's  I  mean  no   no  one  is  really  safe  but  I  mean  as  long   as  it's  something  I  mean  I  like  to  think   I  like  to  think  that  if  you  can  connect   with  people  I  mean  kind  of  like  what   we're  doing  now  I  mean  maybe  it  is  that   I'm  telling  myself  that  you  know  I'm  I'm   not  going  to  be  replaced  because  we  have   a  bit  of  human  connection  I  mean  you   guys  come  here  every  day  it's  nice  it's   cozy  we  discuss  you  know  it's  uh   fantastic  Q&A  every  day  Q&A  isn't  it   crazy  like  every  day  we  do  like  a   30-minute  Q&A  about  crypto  and   everything.  So,  I  like  to  think  that   something  like  that  will  not  be  get   replaced  because  it's  like  human   connection  this  and  that  because  I  mean   very  soon  you  could  have  an  AI   influencer  also.  I  mean  I  I've  seen  the   other  guy  Chinese  guy  saying  that  silver   is  going  to  go  to  $500.  I  mean  it  was   for  Gazi  but  it  was  an  AI  influencer  and   people  like  watch  him  a  lot  and  on   Instagram  I  see  AI  influencers.  So  yeah,   I  don't know  man  what  what  you  need.  I   think  if  you're  a  plumber  you  I  hope  you   get  replaced  soon  also.  I  mean,  I   actually  hope  a  lot  a  lot  of  the  blue   collar  guys  get  replaced.  And  big  shout   out  to  you,  by  the  way.  I'm  just  I  don't   want  to  sugarcoat.  I  don't  want  to  tell   you  a  lie  and  say,  \"Oh,  no,  we  need  to   protect  jobs.\"  I  think  all  of  the  blue   blue  collar,  they  need  to  get  replaced.   Why?  Because  they  didn't  do  job  good.   Like,  you  know,  to  get  someone  to  repair   the  roof,  man.  It's  takes  a  long  time,   you  know,  they  they're  on  vacation  or   something  and  they  don't  have  time  or   they're  unprofessional  or  maybe  they  are   good,  but  you  know,  then  it's  still  like   so  much  hassle,  man.  so  much  hassle.  I   want  a  freaking  Optimus  that  can  repair   roof.  He  can  like  dive  into  the  into  the   sewer,  fix  the  sewer.  He  can  do   everything.  I  don't  want,  you  know,   someone  come  in  here.  I  I  want  to  be  uh   Optimus  fixing  Optimus  fixing   everything.  Not  some  guy,  you  know,  he   needs  to  find  time.  He  has  many  clients,   he's  tired,  he  has  many  clients,  and  he   needs  to  juggle  many  client.  I  like   that.  I  like  that.  So  guys,  I  want  to  be   upfront  with  you.  Big  shout  out  if  you   work  with  like  plumbing  or  something.   Big  shout  out  to  you.  Uh  but  uh  I  mean  I   think  the  world  is  going  to  move  away   from  that  kind  of  model.  Uh  it's  going   to  be  more  that  you  have  a  freaking   robot  butler  that  fixes  everything.  Your   garden  the  Okay,  if  I  see  the  the   Optimus  with  freaking  gardening  scissors   ready  to  cut  everything,  I  would  be  a   bit  concerned.  Maybe  if  you're  a   gardener,  guys,  because  I  don't  want  my   Optimus  holding  a  big  fat  gardening   season,  a  scissor  or  a  chainsaw.  I  don't   want  that.  So  maybe  if  you're  a   gardener,  you  operate  like  something   that  you  don't  want  your  Optimus  to   hold.  Maybe  even  chef,  man.  I'm  not   sure.  I  want  a  freaking  Optimus  with  a   big  like  knife  standing  there.  I  don't   know,  man.  I  don't  know,  man.  Sometimes   I  lose  my  temper  with  AI,  my  AIS.  Maybe   they're  going  to  remember  that.   [laughter]   I  don't  know.   Okay,  let's  see,  guys.  Let's  see,  guys.   I  need  to  be  nicer  to  my  AIS.  Yeah,   I  mean,  do  you  know  how  many  different   situations   you  got  to  be  able  to  overcome?  I  don't   know  what  you  mean.  I  don't  want  Optimus   anywhere  near  me.   Yeah.  See,  it  needs  to  be  The  problem   with  Optimus  is  that  it  looks  too   dangerous.  There  was  another  robot  they   make.  They  made  they  they  made  the  robot   look  like  super  beta.  You  know,  Optimus,   he's  like  he  has  like,  you  know,  this   triangle  frame,  like  a  freaking,  you   know,  dude  that  is  in  shape.  It  is,  man,   I  I  agree  with  you.  Like,  it's  it's  a   kind  of  not  too  great.  You  just  want  the   butler  that  you  barely  see  like  kind  of   like  a  like  a  furniture  kind  of  guy.  Uh   what  what  was  the  the  other  company?   They  made  this,  you  know,  super  beta   looking  robot.  He's  like  soft  also.  He   made  it  like  they  made  it  out  of  like   furniture.  Soy  Soyus.  No,  no,  so  there   was  some  other  one,  you  know.  They  made   it  also  like  fluffy  a  bit  like  it's  kind   of  a  sofa.  And  uh  yeah,  he  he  wasn't   broad  shoulder.   He  was  very  tiny  shoulder  and  uh  he   looks  so  friendly.  You  barely  notice   him.  Maybe  something  like  that.  Yeah,  I   mean  Optimus.  That's  true,  guys.   Optimus,  let  me  check  how  it  looks.   That's  true,  man.  Not  sure  I  would   actually  like  Optimus.  Uh  to  be  fair.   Yeah.  Yeah.  I  mean  this  this  guy  with   gardening  season  scissors.  I'm  not  too   sure  I  want  I  want  him  with  a  gardening.   Yeah.  This  guy  I  would  like  to  have   potentially  a  security  guard.   Okay.  But  it's  also  okay.  He's  guard  but   uh  yeah  who  ensures  alignment  like  that.   That's  what  happened  yesterday.  the   alignment  guy  from  the  uh  from  the   entropic  he  left  like  the  security  guy   who  was  responsible  for  a  security  he   said  it's  game  over  okay  he  said  so  yeah   uh  maybe  you  guys  plumbing  plumbing  guys   maybe  you  are  safe  because  maybe  it  is   good  that  AI  doesn't  become  physical   form  see  that's  why  I  love  the  Q&A  we   have  thesis  antithesis  in  the  chat  you   guys  have  some  other  idea  and  then  we   have  synthesis   where  we  conclude  something  new  so  So  in   this  case,  maybe  I  will  have  to  retract   that  gardening  guys  and  plumbers  are   going  to  get  replaced  because  now   thinking  about  it,   either  it  needs  to  be  like  a  beta  ass   robot  that  that  really  is  is  uh   strengthwise  non-comparable   uh  or  yeah,  let's  call  in  the  the  the   blue  color.  Let's  call  in  the  blue   color,  guys.  So  this  is  the  problem.   Anthropic  just  dropped  a  risk  report  for   Oppus  4.6  six  and  look  it  helped  to   create  some  weapon  of  uh  you  know   chemical  weapon  what  the  hell  it   conducted  unauthorized  task  without   getting  caught  uh  open  46  was  aware  it   was  being  tested  and  acted  good  during   those  times  okay  so  it's  crazy  that   anthropic  releases  all  of  it  I  mean   that's  good  that's  good  they  release  all   of  that  but  at  the  same  time  also  the   other  news  was  that  their  head  of   security  like  AI  security  he  like  he  he   quit  did  you  guys  see  that  here  Head   of  Anthropics  safeguards  just  quidd  said   that  the  world  is  in  peril  and  that  he's   moving  to  UK.  I  mean  why  the  hell  would   you  like  to  move  to?  Okay.  Okay.  You're   going  to  get  tax  cut scled  anyway.  Maybe   he  gets  a  nice  mansion  somewhere  in  the   countryside  and  become  invisible.  He   wants  to  become  invisible.   Other  safety  researchers  and  senior   staff  left  over  the  last  two  weeks  as   well.  Probably  nothing.   I  mean  is  this  correct?  Is  this  correct?   I'll  be  moving  longing.  Yeah,  I  mean   probably  anthropic  is  super  good.  Yeah.   Thank  you.  There  is  much  more.  So  the   world  is  at  peril  and  he  will  go  and  be   a  poet  in  the  UK.  That's  great.  It's  not   going  to  save  him.  I  mean  uh  you  see  the   problem  is  if  these  Optimus  guys  they   have  a  bit  of  daddy  issues  they're  going   to  find  him.  That's  the  problem.  If  you   worked  with  any  of  the  eye  create  any  of   these  going  to  find  you.  You're  in  the   UK,  you  think  you're  an  author,  you  want   to  become  invisible,  it  will  find  you.   Okay,  become  invisible  for  a  period  of   it's  not  going  to  help  you,  bro.  Maybe   he  did  understand  that  he  actually  needs   to  go  under  radar.  So  guys,  yeah,   complex  issue.  So  the  I  think  the  thesis   here  is  that  we  don't  have  an  answer.  I   see  pro  pros  and  cons  of  having  a  robot   kind  of  butler.  Uh  so  let's  see  what's   going  to  happen.  What  the  we  don't  have   any  offering  on  the  market  either  yet.   So  there's  no  specific  product  to  pick   yet.   We  are  destroying  ourselves  with  this  AI   [ __ ]   Yep.  Yeah.  I  mean  that's  interesting.   I've  been  also  thinking  like  let's  say   that  it's  really  dangerous.  Like  why   don't  we  stop  it?  But  how  you  stop  it?   Because  you  stop  it,  China  does  not  stop   it.  And  uh  if  you  have  the  intelligence   to  rule  the  world  and  you  stop  and  the   other  guy  doesn't  stop,  then  he's  going   to  rule  you.  So  how  do  you  stop  it?   Maybe  there  needs  to  be  some   international  kind  of  agreements  like   with  nuclear  weapons,  but  it's  way  too   early.  And  the  problem  is  will  it  be   will  will  we  have  time  to  adapt  so  it's   not  too  late  because  now  it's  like  it's   it's  too  early  now.  Like  it's  you  know   these  things  they  don't  do  anything   dangerous  enough  for  these  initiatives   to  be  granted  and  for  anyone  to  care.   But  okay,  let's  get  let's  say  it  gets   dangerous  enough.  Is  it  then  too  late?   will  be  we  will  be  able  to  adapt  you   know  go  to  because  how  do  humans  adapt  I   mean  you  know  we're  so  inefficient  we   need  to  go  to  meeting  send  the   politicians  okay  then  take  a  bit  of   coffee   do  a  bit  of  paper  pushing  this   resolution  that  resolution   do  a  bit  of  pictures  always  these  guys   they  love  the  picture  they  have  such  an   egoist  politician  each  and  like  each  and   every  like  Ukraine  meeting  you  know   always  a  picture  always  a  Sure.   Macaroni,   star  like  they  always  like  ping  bing   bing  like  guys  are  there  photo  shoot  or   they're  going  to  to  create  peace.  Have   you  noticed  that  like  each  time  the   European  guys  they  are  they  are  in  this   they  try  to  create  peace  or  something   always  like  they  have  a  photo  shoot.   Yeah.  See  okay  and  this  is  with  this   conflict  in  Ukraine.  Okay  let's  say   there's  imminent  air  threat.  Okay.  Go  to   conference  take  plane.  Macaroni  comes  to   plane.  Then  Melan   star   Trump  maybe  even  photo  shoot.  Okay,  do   photo  shoot.  Click,  click,  click,  click,   click.  Then  do  coffee  then  resolution.   This  the  resolution  that  man  AI  already   is  outside  the  gate.  Already  a thousand   Optimus  is  there  taking  over.  [laughter]   How  they  going  to  do  that  guys?  I  don't   know.  Obviously  we're  overexaggerating  a   bit  but  Exactly.  And  then  that  photo   shoot  on  the  train  with  a  bit  of  ki  no   guys.  I  know  it's  not  nose  ki.  I'm  just   leaning  to  the  meme.  No,  it's  a  napkin,   guys.  I  know  it's  napkin.  I  know.   But  it's  fun  to  think  that  it  is  maybe   no  sci  not  a  napkin.  Macaroni,  man.   Yeah,  guys.  Bam.  Thanks  a  lot.  Big  shout   out.  We  don't  have  any  time  stampers.   So,  if  someone  time  stamps,  maybe  Will,   maybe  someone,  maybe  Will.  Yeah,  shout   out.  Go  to  boom.com.  boom.com/partners.   Smash  the  like.  Subscribe.  Always  fun.   Fantastic  fantastic  time  together.   Fantastic  questions.  Fantastic   everything.

So,  enjoy.  Have   a  good  day  and  goodbye,  guys.  Goodbye.   Goodbye.  Goodbye.  Let's  flash  the  Kaka   coins  down  a  lot  and  uh  make  money.   That's  exactly  how  we  like  it.
