        "transcript": "Big short Michael Bur is now issuing a warning about Palunteer. Basically, he just posted a chart that says that Palunteer is going to $50 per share. So, don't click nothing, don't smash nothing, don't buy nothing. Just listen, pay attention, and let's get started. So, this is not the first rodeo of Michael Bur being bearish or rather bullish on Palunteer. We heard these arguments from him before. He laid this out in an interview where he covered all of his issues with Palunteer and I'm going to go over them one by one and I'm going to share with you my opinion. Now, of course, you know what they say, opinions are like buttholes. Everybody's got one. But if you're here on this channel, you probably value mine. So, here's what I think about Michael B's argument. I'm not going to talk about the shortterm technical aspects of what he's saying. I'll actually surprise you at the end of this video because I kind of agree with him. Kind of. Hang on. You have to wait till the end to find out what exactly I mean. But on the grand scheme of things, Michael Bur is basically claiming that number one is that Piloter is nothing but a consultancy business masquerading as some sort of an AI superpower company. And this is an argument that we heard many times in the past. Essentially the core of this argument is that piloter is essentially building customtailoring software solutions for clients and essentially they are similar to a deoid or one of the other consulting or McKenzie or a centure. It's basically a consulting company that's trying to get the evaluations of software and that is nothing but a misunderstanding and I'll explain why. Now of course consultancy companies who sell you manh hours essentially you have a partner or an associate or some sort of a junior guy or an intern working and then you get billable hours much like in a law firm much like in any consultancy that is not a very scalable business. It is very lucrative and you can make a lot of money in these businesses but they're not as scalable as selling a software solution because a software is pretty much a something you can replicate almost non-stop with very minimal little cost. So for you guys and I'm going to educate here the difference how you spot the difference between a consultancy and a software company is very very simple. No matter how much you masquerade your business, one thing you cannot do as a consultancy business, if you're selling manh hours, you simply cannot present mathematics and numbers of software companies. If I'm selling you a downloadable product, a PDF, and I keep charging you $10 for that PDF, and let's say a million people buy that PDF, I can scale this 2 million, 10 million. I almost don't have to do any extra work to sell you this extra PDF file. Right? On the other hand, if I'm selling you my own time or my partner's time or my firm's time, well, we can make a lot of money, but we cannot scale it to infinity. So, the margins, whether it's gross margins, operating margins, free cash flow margins will not be the same in a software business, in a digital product, and a consultancy. And all you have to do here is just look at the numbers. Follow the money, not the arguments. Now, Palanteer is operating at 80% gross margin. That is simply not possible with a consultancy business where you have to pay salaries and travel and you have to pay for offices and supplies and furniture and whatnot. At 80% gross margin, it's very difficult. But if you also look at the revenue growth, it is virtually impossible for any consultancy, law firm, accounting firm, whatever you call it, a consultancy cannot grow 60% yearoveryear. It is literally humanly impossible when you're selling manh hours. And it certainly cannot give you 50% free cash flow margin. Essentially what this means, free cash flow margin means that for every single dollar Palunteer makes from sales, they get to keep 50 cents in their bank account. That's free cash flow. That's money. Impossible in a consultancy. But at the same time, all of these numbers happen. If you're selling 60% more this year, but your operating expenses opex only up 14%. Imagine that. selling 60% more with only 14% more expenses. That means that you have an extremely scalable business that simply physically cannot be a consultancy. These numbers mathematically do not belong in a consultancy business. These economics cannot exist if it is a consultancy. You cannot scale manh hours and headcount like a software business. his margins prove that this is false. Now, if you want to tell me that Palunteer sending engineers on location to onboard new clients for 3 weeks is consultancy, well, I think you're just misunderstanding what consulting really means. That is on boarding a client has nothing to do with consultancy. And I think this argument is a gross misunderstanding what Palunteer is and what Palunteer isn't. Now the second thing I want to talk about here is that kind of aura that is getting out of the Michael Bay argument is that pilot is more marketing it's more hype it's not real AI company you know it's not anthropic it's not open AI it's you know it's just a lot of marketing a lot of hot air now look we have two decades of research and development of Palunteer okay Palunteer was literally first to the AI scene on the business side when everybody was playing around with their little chips doing little prompts and queries. Palunteer was trying to figure out ahead of everybody else, hey, how can we deploy this in the real world for big businesses AI just essentially highlighted how valuable Pilenteer Foundry was. Foundry was making sense and making logic out of chaos. Imagine how much more chaos now we have with AI and how much more tools to clean all of this as long as you can put these things together. Now look at how much clients are spending more on Palunteer products. Think about it. The net dollar retention of Palunteer north of 120, the growth in the customers, the growth in the revenues, if this was hype, if this was marketing, imagine a company spending so much more money every year and clients on boarding every year to pay for literally hot air. I haven't seen a setup like this in my life where companies just volunteered to pay for hot air non-stop. Now, if we had no growth in revenues, if this was empty calories and we were just telling stories about the future, maybe we could have entertained this argument. for a company that's growing 60% per year in revenues making multibillion dollar quarters. On top of it, of course, we have the age-old stockbased compensation argument which is essentially that Palunteer is saving a lot of money and doesn't have a lot of expenses like other companies do because it gives out so much stock, so much equity to its employees and to its managers. So instead of paying them, they're paying them through diluting the existing shareholders, which is an argument that I can understand, but we've already resolved this multiple times over. Okay, number one, there is no such thing as, well, this is just delusion. I'll explain why. Okay, even if you put back stockbased compensation and you expense it out of the existing numbers of Palanteer of the gross margin, operating margin, everything, you just actually account for stockbased compensation, the numbers are not going to be that much different. In fact, Palunteer is still going to have elite elite numbers. On top of it, the whole idea here of delution, and I'll show you exactly in a second why delution is only bad if you handed out stocks, if you handed out RSUs and options to idiots, to bozos. If you gave superstars equity, then you've made money even though technically you got diluted. And I'll show you why and how this works. So imagine you now own 20% of a company. And now this company is worth $100,000. Well, your piece is worth 20,000, right? Imagine I offer that we give everybody gives half their stuff to recruit some superstars to the company. So now everybody gives half their shares in order to recruit some superstars to really upgrade the company. And now my pie is now not 20% but it's 10%. It got decreased. So now my pi is only 10%. But the superstars I've hired and I gave stock to now increased the company's valuation from 100,000 to 500,000. So now my piece is worth 50K even though I own only 10% instead of 20 because the pie got a lot bigger because of the stock we gave out. So what would you rather have 50k or 20k? The number the percentage doesn't matter as long as your total piece of the pie gets bigger. So what if it used to be 20 and now it's 10%. If the pi got bigger and oh my goodness the pi got bigger 1300% increase in the share price since the company went public in 2020. I think it's pretty clear that the pie got bigger. Okay. So the stockbased comp  is out of here. Now I think Palanteer is still somehow completely misunderstood. Right? Look at the recent action they just had. They just signed a little $1 billion deal with Airbus. Small deal, right? But here's the thing now. Every single airline that's going to keep using Airbus planes, which is half the airlines in the world, if not more, they're going to become literally a distribution channel for Palunteer Skywise. And every new client of Airbus essentially becomes a distributor for free for more Palunteer products, etc., etc. And their suppliers and the guys they work with, their contractors, everybody's getting into the system essentially. By paying a billion dollars to Palunteer, Airbus became a marketing agent for Palunteer to sell Palunteer products. That's insane and yet completely misunderstood. Now, I think Palunteer essentially, and this is the part that most people are so struggling with, they've become this kind of connective tissue that allows AI to exist in real business. Because real business isn't chat GPT, isn't cloud, isn't anthropic, right? You have to have compliance, you have to have privacy, you have to have legal aspects. The cost, the cost of running AI is so expensive. You have to somehow find a way to bring down the cost. The security aspects, you can't get hacked, you can't lose people's data, and it actually has to massively improve your business in order for all this hassle to be worth it. Now, Piloter does all that and they're completely agnostic to which hardware you're using. GPUs, if you're Google, if you're Nvidia, LLMs, doesn't matter which large model, which AI, they're completely agnostic. Whatever AI is dominating, Palanteer will make your business outperform your competitors with it. That's the secret. That's why Palant is growing like crazy. It's not because Alex Karp's hair, right? On top of it, I think government is completely misunderstood. Right? Government right now is a massive, massive opportunity for volunteer. Long contracts, sneaky clients, large contracts, and it builds a lot of credibility in the commercial sector. And we have this massive AI race right now going on. On top of this, whatever happens with our economy, imagine we go through a recession. The government spending ain't going nowhere. This is literally stable as a rock. 50% of Palunteer business is safe. It's macroaggnostic. Show me a company of this size with these parameters. It does not exist. On top of it, the AI races in the government side is going to be absolutely insane. Now, I think this is just the start. This is just the start for Palunteer. This is just the start for Nvidia. This is just the start for AI really if you think about it. But a lot of people going to be skeptical. Now, here's the part where I said I kind of agree with Michael Bur. I don't know what the stock is going to do in the short term. I don't know. Okay, Michael Barry is saying that technicals show that Palunteer can land at $50. I don't do technicals. I don't do short-term trading. I don't know. But hey, it's definitely possible. Palanteer's history, Palunteer's volatility easy can go to $50. Easy. Went from 120 to 70 in last year in a matter of a couple of weeks. Palanteer can possibly get to $50. To that part, I will agree with Michael Bur. And if that happens, I'll just buy more because I'm in it for the long haul. And if I get a discount and I get palent $50, by all means, sell it to me. No problem. Okay? I want a piece of the operating system monopoly of AI. And you can keep complaining about the high P ratio, which you complained about, 1300% ago when the P ratio was still very, very high. So, you keep complaining about the P ratio while we keep investing in a company that becomes a monopoly in AI software. Now, if you want to take this to the next step, I urge you to check out our academy. There's a reason we have 28,000 members because this system, this way of thinking is how you make money long-term, smart, patient, trusty process. patron.com/tomash would love to have you in there. Thank you so much. I'll see you next one.",

A videóban hangsúlyozzák, hogy Burry érvei hamis premisszákon alapulnak, miszerint a Palantir egy egyszerű tanácsadó cég, nem pedig egy igazi szoftverfejlesztő vállalat. A jelenlegi számok, mint az 80%-os bruttó haszonelvárás és a 60%-os éves bevételnövekedés, arra utalnak, hogy a Palantir olyasmit csinál, ami messze túlmutat a hagyományos tanácsadáson. Burry érveit elfogadni tudják, de az nem tükrözi a valóságot, mivel a Palantir sikeresen csökkenti az AI költségeit más üzletek számára. A videó végén a szerző azt hangsúlyozza, hogy a Palantir jövője fényes, és megérheti a befektetést, függetlenül a rövid távú ingadozásoktól.",
        "summary_en": "Michael Burry issues a warning regarding the future of Palantir stocks, predicting a rise in share prices. The video emphasizes that Burry's arguments are built on false premises, claiming that Palantir is merely a consultancy and not a true software development company. Current metrics, such as an 80% gross profit margin and 60% year-over-year revenue growth, indicate that Palantir operates beyond traditional consultancy dynamics. While Burry's concerns may be acknowledged, they do not reflect reality, as Palantir is effectively reducing AI costs for other businesses. At the video’s conclusion, the narrator underscores that Palantir’s future looks promising, making it worth the investment, regardless of short-term fluctuations.",
