        "transcript": "The government hates financial privacy. For the last four years, that has been the only narrative that matters. We have seen developers arrested, code sanctioned, and privacy protocols treated like digital contraband. The message from the previous administration was crystal clear. If you want to transact privately, you must have something to hide. And if you have something to hide, you're probably a criminal. But then something impossible happened. >> That's impossible. Just a few days ago, on December 15th, the new leadership at the Securities and Exchange Commission didn't just soften their tone, [music] they completely flipped the script. We heard the new SEC chair describe blockchain technology not as a tool for crime, but as a potential quote financial panopticon that threatens the liberty of every single American. And given how OG privacy coin project Zcash is up over 700% in a matter of months, it would appear many investors agree. So, is the war on privacy actually [music] ending? Or is this just a trap to lure retail investors back into the crosshairs before the next crackdown? To answer [music] that, we have to look at what was actually said behind closed doors at the SEC and why the smart money is suddenly piling into privacy. My name is Lewis and you're watching the Coin Bureau. First up, I must make one thing clear. I am not a financial adviser and none of what follows is financial advice. This is educational content meant to help you understand the shifting sands of crypto policy. If that sounds good, then hit that like button and let's get into it. So, let's take a look at the events of December 15th, 2025. The SEC's crypto task force held a roundt on financial surveillance and privacy. Now in the bad old days of the previous administration, a meeting like this would have been a firing squad. It would have been hours of bureaucrats lecturing us on how crypto is used by North Korean hackers and drug cartels. But this time the tone was radically different. We need to be precise here because the headlines are getting a bit muddled. You might have seen tweets claiming the SEC chair said privacy should be the norm. That specific quote actually came from Commissioner Hester Pur, who has long been a champion of crypto. She stated quite boldly that quote, \"Protecting one's privacy should be the norm, not an indicator of criminal intent.\" But what SEC Chair Paul Atkins said was arguably even more significant because he's the one steering the ship. He didn't just defend privacy. He attacked the government's appetite for surveillance. Atkins warned that if the government treats every wallet like a broker and every transaction as a reportable event, crypto could become quote the most powerful financial surveillance architecture ever invented. He used the term financial panopticon. For those who skipped philosophy class, a panopticon is a prison designed where the inmates can be watched at all times without knowing when they are being watched. for the head of the SEC to use that specific metaphor to describe government overreach is frankly staggering. He went on to say that the government's quote insatiable desire for data puts the liberty of American investors at risk. This is a complete 180° turn from the Gary Gendler era where the assumption was that transparency was good and opacity was bad. Atkins is effectively saying that total transparency on a public blockchain is actually a danger to civil liberties if the government abuses it. And he didn't stop there. He explicitly mentioned zero knowledge proofs and selective disclosure as technologies that allow for compliance without handing over your entire life history to the state. So we have the SEC chair acknowledging that the current surveillance state is dangerous and the solution is privacy technology. But to understand why this is such a shock, we have to remember just how dark things looked only a year ago. Context is everything. If you've been in crypto for more than a coffee break, you'll remember the absolute war that was waged on privacy tools between 2022 and 2024. It started in August 2022 when OFAC sanctioned tornado cashache. This was unprecedented because they didn't sanction a person, they sanctioned a piece of code. They sanctioned a smart contract. Then we saw the developers like Roman Storm dragged through the courts. We saw the founders of Samurai Wallet arrested in April 2024 and essentially treated like cartel bosses for building privacy software. The message was that writing code for privacy was aiding and abetting moneyaundering. It didn't matter if the code was neutral. If bad guys used it, the developer was liable. But looking at the data, the tide began to turn quietly in mid 2025, well before Atkins made his comments. In August 2025, the Department of Justice issued a policy shift that flew under the radar for many. Acting Assistant Attorney General Matthew Galliote stated that the DOJ would no longer pursue unlicensed money transmission charges against software developers who create quote neutral tools with no criminal intent. His exact words were, quote, \"Our view is that merely writing code without ill intent is not a crime.\" This was the first crack in the dam. It signaled that the aggressive regulation by enforcement strategy was failing or at least being pulled back. Then we had the tornado cash sanctions officially lifted in March 2025 by the Treasury following a court ruling that said OFAC exceeded its authority. So when you combine the DOJ backing off developers, the courts striking down the sanctions on code, and now the SEC chair calling surveillance a panopticon, you have a perfect storm. The regulatory boot that has been on the neck of privacy protocols is being lifted. But as always, the market sniffed this out before the public fully understood what was happening. And this brings us to the price action. Take a look at this chart. This is Zcash. From late September to early November 2025, ZEC went parabolic. We are talking about a move from the mid70s to a peak of over 740. That's a gain of over 900% in a matter of weeks. Now, usually when a coin pumps that hard with no specific news, we assume it's a pump and dump or some memecoin mania, but Zcash is a dinosaur in crypto terms. It's not a shiny new object. So, what happened? Well, the onchain data tells a fascinating story. While retail investors were largely selling or ignoring privacy coins, whales were accumulating aggressively. We saw wallets holding between $100,000 and $1 million worth of ZEC going vertical in their accumulation. There is a strong argument here for insider trading, or at least informed trading. It seems highly likely that large players knew a shift in the regulatory stance was coming. They likely knew about the DOJ policy memo before it was widely understood and they certainly anticipated the SEC's pivot under the new administration. We also saw institutional vehicles like Gayscale's Zcash Trust see massive inflows growing over 200%. When you see Grayscale piling in, that is not a retail trader in his basement. That is institutional capital positioning for a thesis. And here's the kicker. The volume wasn't just leverage. The spotto futures volume ratio remained high. That means people were buying the actual asset to hold it, not just gambling on the price with 100x leverage. This looks like a fundamental repricing of the asset class. Basically, the market realized that if privacy is no longer illegal, then privacy assets are undervalued by about 90%. But before you rush off to buy the first privacy coin you see, there is a very important distinction to make. Not all privacy is created equal in the eyes of the regulators. And this distinction might be the difference between a 100x gem and a coin that gets delisted to zero. And that reminds me, if you are looking to trade these privacy assets or just stack some Bitcoin before the institutions scoop it all up, you are going to need a reliable exchange.

Why did Zcash pump over 900% while other privacy coins have lagged behind or faced Dell listings? The answer lies in a concept called compliant privacy. You see, Monero is privacy by default. Every transaction is hidden. You cannot opt out of privacy. Regulators generally hate this because it makes their job of tracking funds incredibly difficult. Zcash on the other hand has what are called viewing keys. This allows a user to selectively disclose transaction details to a third party like an auditor or a regulator while keeping that information private from the rest of the world. This is what the SEC chair was referring to when he talked about selective disclosure. This is the holy grail for institutions. Think about it. Why does Black Rockck or a massive hedge fund need privacy? It's not because they are buying illicit substances on the dark web. It's because if they are buying $100 million worth of Ethereum, they don't want the entire market to see them doing it. If the market sees a massive buy order coming, traders will frontrun the trade, driving the price up before the institution can fill its bags. This costs them millions. In traditional finance, they use darkpools, private exchanges where order books are hidden. Crypto is currently a financial panopticon where everyone could see everyone's trades. Institutions hate that. >> I hate that. >> This is why we are seeing the rise of institutional dark pools in crypto and why Zcash's compliant privacy model is so attractive. It aligns with the Clarity Act and other legislative efforts that are trying to bridge the gap between blockchain transparency and business confidentiality. So, the narrative for 2026 isn't privacy for criminals. It is privacy for business. But, and there is always a but, we cannot ignore the rest of the world. While the US might be pivoting, other major powers are doubling down on the war against privacy. The United States is a massive market, but crypto is global. And outside the US, the picture for privacy coins is still looking quite grim. We have talked about Mika, the markets in crypto assets regulation in the European Union. While Mika brings clarity to stable coins and exchanges, it has a poison pill for privacy. By mid 2027, the EU is set to prohibit crypto asset service providers from providing accounts for privacy coins. This effectively bans exchanges like Binance or Kraken from listing Monero or Zcash for EU customers. And we're already seeing the effects. We've seen D-listings in Japan, South Korea, and looming bans in Europe. Then you have the FATF, the Financial Action Task Force. They are the global watchdog for moneyaundering. Their travel rule requires exchanges to share user data for transactions over a certain threshold. As of late 2025, nearly 100 jurisdictions are implementing these rules. Privacy coins that cannot share sender and receiver information struggle to comply with this. So we are heading towards a bifurcation of the market. On one side, you might have the US under a new administration fostering a compliant privacy sector where tools like Zcash or protocols like Aztec and Rail Gun thrive because they offer selective disclosure. On the other side, you have Europe and Asia where privacy by default coins like Monero might be pushed entirely into the peer-to-peer shadows, delisted from all centralized exchanges. This creates a massive risk but also a massive opportunity. If the US becomes the safe haven for privacy tech, capital will flow there. But if the global delistings continue, liquidity for these tokens could dry up significantly outside of decentralized exchanges. So what is the verdict? Has the SEC really flipped on crypto privacy? The answer is a curious yes. The rhetoric has shifted from privacy is criminal to surveillance is dangerous. That is a monumental win for the industry. The Zcash pump wasn't just a random event. It was a repricing based on the realization that privacy technology is essential for the next phase of crypto adoption, the institutional phase. However, the days of the Wild West are likely over. The future belongs to protocols that can thread the needle, providing privacy for the user while offering provable compliance for the regulator. If you are betting on the sector, you need to understand that distinction. Privacy by default will likely remain a niche cipher punk ideal. Valuable but constantly under attack. Compliant privacy is where the trillions of dollars of institutional capital will likely flow. But what do you think? Is the war on privacy really over or is this just a pause before the next battle? And are you holding any Zcash or Monero? Let us know in the comments below. Okay, that's going to be all for me for today. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time. This is Louis signing off."
