        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I've got a juicy show for you today. In clip one, Google and Amazon are dropping massive capex numbers. We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars and investors are freaking out. But Gene Monster breaks down why this might actually confirm why we're still in the early innings of AI. Then in clip 2, we get the SpaceX X AI merger announcement, and suddenly it all connects because apparently the future of space isn't about the Mars mission. It's about launching data centers into orbit. And finally, we'll see Tom Lee's recent comments in a bonus clip at the end, which is worth hanging around for. >> Well, Google last night talked about half of their capex going specifically to Azure. And a lot of it going to compute for other training that they're doing. But I think in general, you should look at about 80% of this capex is going to be somehow AI related, whether it's robotics. And of course they have their regular way of of business when it comes to capex and doing some things on the outer edge I guess literally in space. But to answer your question it's probably 80% still a really big number and speaks to I think what is the conviction that these companies have in terms of where AI is going. >> And Gan if that's the case let's say they're right. It it actually helps you understand perhaps why the market has been so hostile to software because if we're going to be spending, you know, $600 billion in five companies or whatever it's going to be this year on capex because they see so much demand that has to displace some massive revenue and profit pool somewhere uh in the in the world. I mean, and they're assuming it's going to be a lot of software. Yeah, I think it's a good assumption and I want to go back to the uh you know software of impact by this. I want to go back to uh the the concept of like what kind of weight should investors put into these a huge capex numbers and specifically is that um they are coming from a select few number of companies and there's a central question this all plays into the software question too a basic question to ask which is are the companies that are amping up these investment are they competent do they have a good view of where the world is going and if you ultimately say they don't then the reaction is perfectly fine find that that these stocks Google last night, Amazon tonight trading off on these big capex numbers. But if you think that they have a unique view, which I believe they do and do have confidence in terms of how to get an ROI on AI, we've seen big ROI from Amazon, from Google and Meta more recently on it. But if you believe that uh they are in fact competent, the only takeaway you can have here is that we're still at the very beginning of the transformation around AI that uh the amount of capex it's not going to end in 2026. It's going to continue. The growth rates might flow a little bit but it will continue to be huge numbers in 27 and we're still early. And why that should resonate not only for the infrastructure people but also across in the software is it speaks to the level of disruption that ultimately will come. And I think that's the central point that I'm not getting the joke because I still think this is really good with the the capex numbers. The brain of AI is getting bigger. I think that's going to yield more AI utility and more AI disruption. It's not going to end with software. it's gonna uh it will it will play over to everything and uh and unemployment and there's just so many risks to it. But I still believe that this is a sign the simple takeaway from Google and Amazon their capex numbers is we're still early. >> Tech companies are spending $600 billion this year on AI infrastructure because they figured out the demand is real. So for Google 80% of their total spending is AI related. Amazon's doing similar numbers and investors are panicking because that's a lot of money going out the door with no immediate return. But Jean's point is actually pretty important here. These are the most profitable companies in the world and they're all making the same bet at the same time. And the thing is they have to be right about where that money goes. Gene mentions it's probably displacing software revenue somewhere which explains why software stocks have been getting hammered. If you're spending $600 billion dollars building AI infrastructure, a compute power is replacing something and it's fundamentally changing what software can do and who can build it. Company spending this much money is worried about getting left behind in a complete paradigm shift. And the competence question matters more than I think people are giving it credit for. When one company spends big on a new technology, you can call it a gamble. When five of the smartest companies in tech all increase spending by 30 to 40% in the same year, that's a pattern recognition. They're all seeing the same demand signals, the same customer behavior, the same trajectory. And they've all done this before. Amazon with AWS, Google with search infrastructure, Meta with mobile. They know what hockey stick adoption looks like and they're building ahead of it. What I think Gan gets right is the disruption piece. This isn't about making chat bots slightly better. When you're deploying this much capital, you're betting on structural change. AI that actually replaces workflows, creates new markets, enables things that weren't possible before. And the capex numbers keep going up, which means they're not seeing a plateau yet. They're seeing acceleration. So yeah, software is getting disrupted first because that's the obvious target. But this touches everything eventually. how companies hire, how products get built, what services become possible, the brains getting bigger, which means the capabilities keep expanding. If you want to understand how AI infrastructure actually works, compute, the training, why these capex numbers matter, I put together a course called the AI landscape. It's designed to break down AI in a digestible way, so you can follow these developments as they happen. Links in the description below. You get lifetime access and the price will go up as we add new modules. And speaking of infrastructure builds, this next clip is where it gets really interesting. SpaceX just merged with XAI ahead of an IPO, creating a combined company worth over a trillion dollars. And the reason they're doing this isn't what you'd expect. It's because SpaceX future is launching data centers into space. And they just filed plans for a million satellite orbital constellation. Apparently, we just found the biggest business model for space. Let's jump into the Musk ecosystem. This is the birth of Musk Inc. Uh, love it. As a shareholder of of SpaceX and XAI, I'm super excited about this. So, this was just announced yesterday. SpaceX merging with XAI ahead of IPO. That merger has gone through. Uh, and why are they doing this? Why are they bringing them together at a company valued over a trillion dollars? Uh, because the future of SpaceX is launching data centers. and Dave and Alex and See, I'm just blown away by the fact that we weren't talking about this seven months ago and all of a sudden it's driving the merger of these companies, you know. It's uh it's fascinating. Absolutely fascinating. >> Oh, so fascinating. You got to think too about the defense of these things. He's doing it. He's It's going to happen now. It went from, you know, like you said, we weren't even talking about it. Now it's definitely going to happen. Uh you got to defend these things. So then we'll have a Space Force issue to to start talking about which will be fun. >> Anyway, we'll get our we'll get our thousand launches a day uh like you've always wanted, Peter. And we have a we have a purpose, you know, and then the efficiency of that will get so high that the the process of getting boots on Mars will be sort of easy. When I was running, >> bastard this. >> When I was running SDS and you and I together at theta Tai at 372 ME drive, >> shout out to our fraternity brothers at MIT, you know, I was trying to come up with the rationale for why we should open up space. You know, it was all of these very soft rationale of, you know, Teflon and spinouts and all of that. Never ever in my life would have imagined it's going to be data centers, but here we are. Now, the contrarian view on this merger, by the way, is that uh that XAI is going to use SpaceX's cash flow uh to fund its massive buildout on the ground right now, right? So, it needs capital uh and it's been raising, right? So, we just raised $20 billion into XAI uh two months ago. Other thoughts on this one? I view this not as product unification but as learning velocity because the speed at which there the feedback loop between all these different elements now becomes unbelievable. Remember when I asked Elon, I said, \"You you look like you're smarter since the time I've known you, you know, 25 26 years ago, and he said, \"Really, what it is is my ability to apply the manufacturing at Tesla, now applying it to SpaceX and the chips at XAI, applying it.\" >> Yeah. You made this point a couple of pods ago, right? The fact that everything is connected and it was turning what Model S factories now into um robot robot factory. It makes sense. >> Yeah. So here, do you know? >> Sorry, go ahead. >> Go ahead, Alex. I I'll just comment if if you read the SEC filings for for this. This is the first time I've seen a government filing saying the express purpose is to achieve Cardartesev level two civilization. >> It it thus it does it says that. So like the the Dyson swarm is hidden with >> their article next. We get the article back. All right. First one here is in the uh in the Musk verse. Uh Tesla is planning to spend $20 billion to support Elon's vision of the future. This is primarily to focus on AI, autonomy, autonomous uh vehicles and robotics, right? Moving away from luxury vehicles. The Model S and Model X are reported to be going away and it's really about building out. What do we see there? Uh Dave, we saw uh the cyber cab manufacturing uh and we saw 9.5 million square feet coming for uh for Optimus Manufacturing next year. >> Right. Yeah. Yeah. >> So 20 billion. >> I mean the scope of this guy's genius and vision is off the scales. It's orders of magnitude. And here's the here's the article that you were speaking to a moment ago. So, let me tee it up and hand it back to you, Alex. SpaceX files plans for a Dyson swarm, uh, a million satellite orbital data center. So, I I cannot imagine being the guy at the FCC who receives this application for a million satellites. I remember back in uh the early 1990s uh when um Aridium was filed um Aridium was was 66 satellites. By the way, the original constellation for Aridium had 77 satellites, which is how many protons there are in Aridium. Uh but then when it got reduced down to 66 satellites, they didn't want to rename it disperosium, which you remember of atom, you know, protons in the 66 um nucleus. Anyway, uh I thought 66 was insanely crazy. Oh my god, 66 satellite constellation. that we've gone to 100,000 and now you we saw the Chinese uh put a filing in for 200,000 not to be outdone friend of the pod Elon says nope we're going for a million and why stop at a million Elon's already commenting Dr. evil style about deploying a billion satellites on X. And I I think this is going to happen if if again if you read the SEC filings. So this story about the Dyson swarm and the last story about the SpaceX XAI merger for 1.25 trillion and then the IPO of SpaceX this year. The these stories are all obviously connected. We finally found a business model for space. It's to build the Dyson swarm and in Elon's words to turn our solar system into his words a sensient sun. That's the end game here. SpaceX figured out the business model for space and it's building compute infrastructure in orbit, not transporting humans to Mars. So 7 months ago, nobody was talking about orbital data centers. And now it's driving a trillion dollar merger between SpaceX and XAI. That's how fast this stuff moves. The logic actually makes sense though. If AI training requires massive computer clusters and you can manufacture satellites at scale, why not put the compute where power is free and cooling is easy? You've got unlimited solar energy, natural heat dissipation, and you're bypassing every regulatory headache about building data centers on Earth. Plus, SpaceX already has Starship designed to launch 100 plus tons at a time. So, the economics might actually work. The contrarian take is that XAI just needs SpaceX cash flow to fund their groundbased buildout. And this merger is really about accessing capital without raising another round. But I think there's way more to it than that. The feedback loop between these companies is insane. Manufacturing lessons from Tesla's factories now applying to robot production. Chip design from XAI informing Tesla's FSD hardware. SpaceX's launch cadence enabling the orbital infrastructure. Each company makes the others better. and the rate of improvement accelerates because they're all connected under one person who can move resources around instantly. What will make this work is we finally connected space infrastructure to an actual revenue model that isn't government contracts or satellite internet. Don't get me wrong, satellite internet is going to be gigantic. But training AI models requires compute that's measured in gigawatt or terowatt. If you can manufacture satellites cheaply enough and launch them for 10 to 20 million per Starship flight, the unit economics starts making sense, especially when your alternative is building massive groundbased data centers that take years to permit and cost billions in real estate and cooling. So yeah, we got our space business model and it turns out the answer was put GPUs in orbits and charge for training runs and inference. Now, let's watch Tom Lee and hear some of his latest takes. Let's bring in CNBC contributor Funst Strats Tom Lee uh who's so timely to speak with not only for DAO 50K and the jump back in tech, but also as the chairman of Bitmine. Tom, I know you're watching what's taking place in crypto. We're talking about a 7-month low uh for the stock Bitmine, the Ethereum paper losses, $8 billion. Is this in jeopardy of going into a pretty dark place? >> Uh, hi Scott. Thanks for having me. Um, you know, Bitmine is designed to be a vehicle that tracks Ethereum prices, but on the upswing because we're going we're adding Ethereum will outperform. >> So, it uh Ethereum's in draw down. Bit mine's going to be in this draw down. >> Bit mine has no leverage. uh it has roughly 4.3 million Ethereum that earns 3% annually and we have 600 million cash earning about 4% in money markets. So the company is making about a million dollars a day. So there is no risk, no need for the company to actually raise money because it's debtree and actually generates about 360 million a year net income. Um I think crypto sentiment is rock bottom because it has been a terrible draw down. I mean, just the past 10 days, Ethereum's down 40%. Um, and that's triggered, I think, a lot of concerns about whether crypto is even viable. But, you know, all of those statements that I just heard and from just a minute ago, I heard the same thing in November 2022 after FTX. And that's the reality that crypto is sort of characterized by hyper volatility and big draw downs. aim just in the last 8 years, Ethereum's had seven draw downs of 60% or more. >> The good news is seven of 7 were all V-shaped recoveries. So, we had a waterfall decline. If crypto's bottoming now, which it kind of looks like it is, especially given Micro Strategies 25% move, the recoveries are V-shaped. So, we we we recover as quickly as we've fallen. >> Just want to follow up on that. where you suggest there's there's no risk to the the company is that assumption that Ethereum has stopped going down that this is a a bottom if there is what some have predicted to be a coming quote unquote death spiral for certain cryptocurrencies if the situation with Ethereum gets worse what happens here >> uh well yeah I mean it's it's a fair question I think we can look at uh metrics For instance, if you look at the number of active addresses on Ethereum, it's up 117% versus a year ago. In fact, in just the last 3 months, that's actually gone up parabolically. Uh, as you know, uh, coming out of Davos, what was the big story around what Wall Street plans to do? It's tokenization, which is moving a lot of their financial infrastructure onto the blockchain. Scott, that's that's not going to change just because crypto pricing have fallen. But what is the blockchain that is evident, you know, lifted uh named by whether it's UBS, Standard Charter or Fidelity, whether tokenizing products, it's on Ethereum. So Ethereum is not in a death spiral because the utility is going up. The price of course has been awful. Unfortunately, you know, crypto prices are volatile. it it's not like earnings estimates change for Ethereum. In fact, uh network usage is up 80% in just the last 6 months. It but it does mean prices move a lot. I mean, it's it's sort of a feature of crypto itself. One of our clients started with zero audience. Now they're doing $100,000 months thanks to YouTube.
