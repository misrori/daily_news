    "transcript": "For years now, Tether's USDT has been  the default crypto dollar. If you've   traded crypto on an exchange or moved  money across borders at light speed,   then you've probably used it. But there's always  been one uncomfortable aspect to USDT, compliance,   especially in the biggest arena of all, the  United States. So now Tether has made a bold move.   It's launched a separate US focused stable coin,  US80, built for America's new stablecoin rule   book. That's a shot fired in the stable coin wars.  Tether doesn't just want to dominate offshore,   it also wants a legit onshore product, too. Right  where Circle and USDC have been strongest. And at   the same time, Tether is sending a totally  different message to the market with gold.   not just their tokenized gold, but a real horde  of precious metal on such a scale that Tether is   now being treated as a serious player in the $34  trillion gold market. So, what is USAT? Why build   it alongside USDT? What's the endgame with all  that gold? And how does Tether plan to remain the   king of stable coins? We dive into all of that and  more in today's video. My name is Guy and you're   watching the Coin Bureau. First up though, I must  make one thing clear. I'm not a financial adviser   and nothing in this video should be considered  financial advice. This is just our take on the   big moves Tether is making to retain its crown.  And if you like content like this, then show us   by hitting that like button and let's get started.  All right, let's begin with Tether's new stable   coin UST. The main difference from Tether's USDT  is pretty straightforward. UST isn't just USDT   branded for the American market. It's a separate  stable coin with a US native setup created because   the US has established a federal rule book for  stable coins and that rulebook must be complied   with. Tether's CEO Paulo Arduino announced  the launch of USAT just a couple of weeks ago.   Former White House official Bo Hines leads the  project as CEO of Tether USAT, while Anchorage   Digital Bank will operate as the issuer. Notably,  Tether has said that USDT will keep operating as   a foreign stable coin, while the new US product  is built to meet regulations laid out in the   Genius Act. In Tether's official communications  regarding USAT, it outlines all the disclaimers US   regulators want to hear. USAT is not legal tender.  It's not issued or guaranteed by the US government   and it's not protected by FDIC or SIPC insurance.  That might sound like straightforward legal stuff,   but it isn't. It's the whole strategy. That's  because the Genius Act sets a baseline for   what a legal stable coin means in the US. The law  states that stable coins must be backed onetoone   with liquid assets like US dollars or short-term  treasuries. Also, issuers have to publish monthly   public disclosures about reserve composition.  It also highlights strict marketing rules,   no implying your governmentbacked, insured or  legal tender. And that's why the issuer of the   stable coin is an important factor. When a  stable coin is issued through a federally   supervised bank such as Anchorage, it changes  everything. The focus is no longer on whether   the peg holds because there's a strict set of  examinations, oversight, and operating standards   inside a system built to punish financial funny  business. Anchorage issues USAT directly from   its federally regulated bank under the oversight  of the office of the controller of the currency.   It's essentially Anchorage broadcasting that  USAT is being produced inside the American   banking perimeter with bank grade compliance, risk  management, and reserve transparency presented as   core features. So where does that leave USDT?  Well, USDT remains the global heavyweight. It's   the token that is already everywhere in crypto,  used by traders, exchanges, and people who just   want digital dollars that move fast and freely.  But Tether knows the US is changing the rules of   engagement and the US is of course a major market  for crypto. So instead of trying to force USDT to   operate in some kind of gray area, Tether is  creating a dedicated US product that starts   with compliance and works backwards. That's the  realization that Tether appears to have had.   So USAT is Tether acknowledging that being the  biggest isn't the same as being welcome in the   biggest market. And with that, you can see what  Tether is really trying to do. Keep USDT dominant   globally while making sure it can't be boxed out  of US institutional demand as stable coins get   pulled deeper into regulated finance. So, USAT is  an effort from Tether to not only retain its title   as the leading stable coin issuer, but also go  after more market share. But how firm is Tether's   lead? Is it now set to eat its competitors? Well,  according to Coin Gecko data, USDT sits at a $185   billion market cap, while the newly minted US has  a market cap of $20 million. Granted, it's in its   infancy. In any case, Tether dominates the stable  coin market with about 60% market share, while   Circle's USDC, the next largest competitor, sits  at only 23%. But if you want to understand the   stable coin war, it makes more sense to see what  the trajectory has been like recently. Why? Well,   because crypto has been trending down for months  and now even the total stable coin market cap is   falling. When times are tough and BTC is dragging  all manner of market metrics down with it,   you get insight into which crypto assets have more  resilience. Since mid January 2026, the overall   stable coin market cap began to decline from its  peak of $311 billion. And who was leading the way?   Circles USDC. But let's put numbers on this to  better illustrate the point. At the time of making   this video, in the early days of February 2026,  USDT sits at a market cap of about $185 billion.   since mid January when the total stable coin  market cap began falling. That's only down around   0.9% from its all-time high. Meanwhile, USDC now  sits at just under 71 billion. Since mid January,   that's down about 6.5%. So, both are feeling the  pressure as crypto goes further risk off. But USDC   has been shrinking a lot faster. And that gap is  where the real fight is happening because USDC   and USDT have always had different selling points.  Circle's main selling point has been compliance. A   stable coin that always plays by the rules and  is built for the regulated world. And that's   important for people or entities moving size like  banks, payments giants, and other institutions   with strict compliance. Case in point, in December  last year, Visa announced it was expanding stable   coin settlement for US banks using USDC. And that  form of integration is precisely where circle   plans to thrive. It may not be the most exciting  headline for crypton natives, but it's the sort of   thing that creates an avenue for major stable coin  adoption. Tether's main edge, on the other hand,   has historically been distribution. USDT  started the stable coin model we know today.   It's the first stable coin most people in crypto  started their journey with and it's widely used   across all manner of exchanges and even across  borders. Tether's brand is the default for many   crypto natives and the firm has only built on that  reputation over the years. Now, the problem for   Circle is that compliance has been a moat mainly  because Tether didn't have a US product that could   credibly play that game. But that's what changed  at the end of January when Tether and Anchorage   Digital announced the US focused UST. USAT  is the first credible domestic competitor for   institutional dollars that could genuinely  threaten Circle's positioning around USDC.   So shots very much fired because if Tether can  keep its global dominance with USDT and also offer   a USfriendly option with US80, then Circle's main  differentiator begins to look less exclusive. But   having said that, Circle excels in a metric that's  hard to ignore, user activity. According to data   from Artemis Analytics, stable coin transactions  hit $33 trillion in 2025 and USDC accounted for   $18.3 trillion of that versus 13.3 trillion for  USDT. So even while USDT is much larger by supply,   USDC has been doing more movement. That tells  you the crucial difference. Supply dominance and   usage dominance aren't the same thing. Tether's  brand can be the default digital dollar people   hold and quote against, while USDC can be the one  that's used disproportionately in settlement and   highfrequency onchain activity. In a downturn,  both can shrink, but they shrink for different   reasons and to different degrees.

So, take a look. Now, Tether's  strategic stable coin moves are one thing, but if   we want to know what Tether thinks the future  looks like, we need to look beyond the stable   coins themselves and look closer at Tether's  reserves. What sticks out? Gold and lots of it.   In the latest assurance report covering the  end of 2025, Tether's issuer entity says it   had $192 billion in reserves backing its fiat peg  tokens with assets exceeding liabilities by about   $6.3 billion. In the breakup of what's backing  USDT, precious metals comes in at $17.45 billion.   And what's that referring to exactly? Physical  gold bars owned by Tether International. Now,   that whopping hoorde of gold is changing the  optics around Tether, the organization. Sure,   the majority is still classic stable coin stuff  like shortdated treasury bills and reverse repo,   but once you're holding gold in the tens of  billions, you're carving out a prominent place   for yourself in the $34 trillion gold market.  And that's exactly how Tether wants to be seen.   Mainstream media has been reporting that Tether  has become a serious presence in the gold market.   Based on that latest attestation, Bloomberg  estimated Tether had a pile of around 140 tons   stored in Switzerland. That's big enough such  that it's described as the largest known stash   of bullion outside of banks and nation states.  Tether CEO Paulo Arduino offered some comment   to Reuters that align with that estimate. He  told reporters that Tether already had about   130 metric tons of physical gold and that they're  buying roughly two tons a week. Arduino said the   firm wants gold to represent something like 10  to 15% of the firm's investment portfolio over   time. So just what the heck is Tether up to here?  Well, for one, the gold can be viewed as a macro   hedge. Gold's been on a tear even considering  the recent sell-off. And if you're throwing off   huge profits from rate driven income, converting  some of that into a hard asset could make sense.   But the deeper play is reputational. Tether  is trying to graduate from a crypto issuer   that prints USDT to a collateral manager that can  run reserves across industries and across cycles.   There's also the pure business side of things  with Tether's tokenized gold. Now, to be clear,   the gold backing Tether's tokenized gold token X  aut is separate from the gold on Tether's balance   sheet regarding USDT. But anyway, the tokenized  gold market sits at over $6 billion, growing 4x   since the end of 2024. Tether wants to dominate  that market as it does US dollar stable coins.   But this is where the gold story stops being  universally flattering because backing tokenized   gold with actual gold is straightforward. But  Tether using gold as partial backing for USDT   is another thing entirely and it's drawing  some scrutiny from the market. In November,   S&P Global downgraded its stability assessment  of USDT to five, the lowest score on its scale.   They cited Tether's increased exposure to higher  risk assets like BTC and gold alongside secured   loans, corporate bonds, and what S&P called  persistent gaps in disclosure around custodians   and counterparties. Now, as anyone who's studied  the 2008 global financial crisis can tell you,   ratings agencies don't always get it right. Far  from it. Nevertheless, S&P Global's perception of   Tether still captures the institutional mindset.  Stable coins are supposed to be boring. The more   complicated the backing gets, the more you're  asking the market to trust your judgment under   pressure. In that context, Tether's issuance of  a US compliant USAT is no surprise. It's a clear   move to capture more institutional demand for  stable coins. But in any case, Tether reportedly   finds itself holding 140 plus tons of gold, and  that will play a key role in the company's future   plans. But what do those plans actually look like?  What is Tether's strategy going forward? Well,   for starters, with that 140 tons of gold, Tether  isn't just collecting shiny rocks. It's starting   to treat bullion like a business. In late 2025,  Tether planned a dramatic expansion in lending to   commodities traders after extending roughly $1.5  billion worth of credit. That's notable because   commodity trading is basically built on credit and  collateral. If you have a monster balance sheet   and a growing pile of precious metals, you can do  more than just sit there hoping the price goes up.   Tether plans to keep pushing profits into  gold while also starting to compete with   banks in trading the metal, recruiting two  senior gold traders from HSBC late last year.   That's a pretty clear signal. They're not only  thinking about reserves, they're thinking about   market making and inventory. Tether has also held  talks to invest across the gold supply chain from   mining and refining to royalty businesses while  also expanding into commodity trade finance.   But let's bring things back to stable coins  because the gold strategy, as big as it is,   sits inside something bigger. Tether's whole game  is distribution, jurisdictional positioning, and   partnerships with a side order of diversification.  In January 2025, Tether relocated to El Salvador   after securing a digital asset service provider  license there. And Paulo Arduino said it would   be the company's first physical headquarters.  That choice is about anchoring the company in   a place that welcomes it while the rest of the  world's jurisdictions finalize exactly how hard   they want to squeeze stable coins. USAT has been a  clear play. With that in mind, the US has largely   formalized its view on stable coins and it's  a key market for obvious reasons. And Tether   needs to win in that region because in other  regions, the squeeze has been real. In Europe,   Micro regulations have pushed exchanges into  cutting off stable coins they can't comfortably   support. Binance has delisted non-compliant stable  coins for EA users, including USDT. And Asia   isn't exactly anything goes either. Hong Kong's  regulator has been moving slowly, but expects   to issue its first batch of stable coin issuer  licenses in March 2026, and only a very small   number at first. Japan, meanwhile, already directs  issuance through regulated financial institutions,   while Korea is still building a one stable  coin framework designed to keep issuers under   strict oversight. But beyond stable coins and  gold, Tether is actually diversifying further.   It's among a long list of firms investing in  Bitcoin mining operations powered by renewables.   The company has also put money into things as far  apart as a $775 million stake in video platform   Rumble and is in talks about a potential 1  billion euro investment into German robotics   firm NORA. So, Tether is complementing its massive  moves in stable coins and gold with a whole slew   of other major ventures. When a stable coin  issuer is trading gold, financing commodities,   buying energy, and building a huge investment  portfolio, well, the label of crypto company   begins to sound a little wide of the mark. And  given how broad Tether's activities have become,   it's increasingly difficult to pin down what kind  of company it really is. And that sets up one of   the main criticisms that's emerged amid its latest  push with USAT. Can one brand credibly sell two   completely different versions of digital dollars  without the trust issues bleeding across all while   it becomes a gold behemoth and a venture firm?  USAT changes Tether's business both explicitly   and implicitly. Tether isn't just promising  that everything is fine anymore. It's explicitly   stepping closer to the world of institutional due  diligence and disclosure expectations that don't   really care about crypto's old norms. However, now  that we have a US-friendly Tether stable coin, the   brand is implicitly admitting the other product  USDT isn't built for the same standards. Now,   some users won't care. They just want a stable  token that's widely accepted. But others might   wonder if Tether can do a regulated product for  the US, why should markets tolerate opacity and   reserve complexity in the offshore giant? And  from that perspective, Tether's hoorde of gold   adds more complexity to this identity problem.  Tether ended 2025 with gold holdings above $17   billion alongside net profits topping $10 billion.  That's clearly a company that wants to be seen   as a serious collateral manager, not just a token  issuer. But in that, they're also handing critics   a clear target. Stable coin backing is supposed to  be boring and liquid, especially under stress. And   as we just saw with the 30th of January metals  wipeout, any gold backing of USDT becomes more   questionable. Gold dropped over 20% across just  3 days. And that's not to mention the moves BTC   is capable of considering it's another alternative  asset backing USDT. So, can Tether pull off being   the best of both worlds without tripping over  itself? Well, quite possibly if UST stays truly   ringing fenced and institutions treat it like  a separate product with separate rules. But if   the market views Tether as one unified reputation,  then things could get messy. A controversy around   USDT could contaminate USAT by association and  the scrutiny that comes with USAT could raise   uncomfortable questions that USDT has historically  been able to sidestep. But for now, Tether is king   and there's no sign of anyone else taking that  crown anytime soon. Well, that's our outlook   on Tether and its major moves in stable coins and  beyond. But what do you think? Is Tether destined   to remain king or is it trying to do too much  too fast? Let us know your thoughts down in the   comments. And if you want to find out why stable  coins are at the center of crypto regulation   controversy, you can watch our video on that  right over here. That's all from me for today,   though. As always, thank you for watching and I'll  see you in the next one. This is Guy signing off.",
