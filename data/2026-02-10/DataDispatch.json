        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. Hope everybody is having at least a decent day as we pretty much continue to see a little bit of a relief rally that carries on from Friday's extension that we saw after the strong beatdown that we saw last week. Uh, and the S&P 500 inches up about another half a percentage point. We're going to be talking about things like Palenteer. We got Michael Bur that's coming back out on X with another big post talking about a bearish type of um head and shoulders pattern. We've been talking about this for Palenteer, especially as we kind of saw it broke down. It's trying to find a possible bottom here. Is this the bottom or is this kind of just a dead cat bounce? We'll be talking about that. Also want to talk about what's happening within the MAG 7 cuz the MAG 7's really kind of got sold off. However, just due to Wall Street beating them down from capex. Um, interesting post that I want to cover too. And of course, we'll be talking about some of the other big things. Robin Hood has earnings tomorrow. uh catching a little bit of a relief after that dipped into the 60s for a little bit and we'll be talking about everything else what you can expect in the market and ending it with crypto. So if you're a new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos. Let's pop it up on the screen here. You see Palunteer comes up about another 5% on the day. Palanteer, you know, hit that bottom, that local bottom we could say at about 130 here and has had a little bit of a relief that has further extended uh into today today's session. And you can see Palanteer is currently here at 143. And obviously you see the head and shoulders here. Uh we see it underneath its 200 uh moving average. So that's where people are talking about you know is this breakdown going to be continued? Uh depending with the market that's kind of a you know also approaching all-time highs. Uh it'll be interesting to see what happens. Um, in terms of Michael Bur, he says right here saying that he's working on something pale and uh, obviously outlining the head and shoulders pattern right here, but looking and talking about his next support uh, is around the 80 level and then the landing area is around 50. Now, that's incredibly bearish. I think it would take a ton of selling pressure, big changes within the macroeconomic environment to kind of correlate and help push Palanteer down further. So, we'll see what happens. But, nonetheless, you know, uh, you know, Palanteer was just basically at like 180. Now, it's only at 140. So, we'll see if there's another sell-off in the market. I think that's basically what we'd have to get is another big sell-off in the market. I think the palunteer to personally experience another type of breakdown that could further test that $80 uh level of support. So, we'll see what happens. But like I said, um in terms of what your time perspective is, you know, trade this as you need, but of course, you know, be careful out there because Palanteer of course does carry a very high valuation price to earnings. So, you know, will that become more of a concern? possibly if we see continue to sell off. Yes. Uh but if we you know Palanteer does have a lot of resilience so also take that with a grain of salt. Uh in terms of what's happening and I like this really like this post from Aman right here talking about really the story is capex and that's really all that matters and talking about you know this AI buildout that we're looking at 2026. Wall Street really is beating down as we've seen with Microsoft, Meta, Amazon and Google of course after the earnings that's we saw last week. uh but around $650 billion dollars is going to be spent from just these companies alone. Um that same reason uh you know who are the winners in play here talking about Nvidia, AMD and all the other players in the semiconductor ecosystem. Also in terms of compute, you know, the bottleneck for power compute. This is keeping me bullish on some of the more individual kind of high beta names that we've been talking about. These different types of data center stocks that are looking to try to build out compute working on the power issue cuz that is going to be the main limitation on this whole AI buildout. That's looking at things like Nebius. You know, Nebus back here at 92. You see Cipher. Cipher came up like 14 15% today. Cipher had a very very good daily move today off of this bottom that we saw here. Cipher, you know, touched down at that $12 or whatever it was. You know, Cipher has been making some strong moves back up here to 1671. In terms of how IR and Cipher have been trading recently, you know, these have been some very good swing trades for people that have embraced the volatility in terms of these, you know, dips down, these snapbacks have been pretty aggressive. uh which shows me you know you know typical resilience in terms of the long term here. You know I like this incredible support that Cypher is really building out here at this 14s and you know with that sell off last week we see we saw it dip here basically into the 10ens into the 11s but that snapback was quite aggressive. So showing me a lot of resiliency within the stock. It'll be interesting to see what happens here. I usually typically like to watch around you know the 18s right here to see if we um have a lot of resistance there around that area. So, we'll see what happens. Waiting for kind of those key catalysts to break out above that. But in terms of some of the stocks that are being beat down, one of the big seven stocks that I like right now, which is kind of interesting because it really depends how does the street view it. You know, I might view it one way. A might view it one way right here, but how does the street really view it? How does the big money do? You know, and that's talking about Amazon right here that really got beat down. It's hanging up just above 200 bucks. It's down like 13 to 14% in the year. Down on 200 billion of capex. That is what the street beat him down for. However, their AWS growth projections is got guiding for 24% a reaceleration. This is kind of the story that I compare to Google last year. If you remember Google last year was not getting any love was trading at like 16 price of sales and you know that was when it was in its high 100s. Now Google is at 323. You know possibly will Amazon have type you know that some that basically type of Google moment? uh talking about you know Meta here even kind of roundt tripping on earnings. So this is where you're seeing I think what you see Wall Street that's bringing optimism back into the MAG7 that's what's going to positively impact the market just because of the weight that we're seeing on it. In terms of the actual S&P 500 though we do have a really nice double bottom that we saw recently right at about that 6800. So right about that 6800 we're seeing a decent amount of support there. You see the S&P 500 comes up above another half a percentage point today above its 50 above its 200. I do like these moves. Um, however, there could be some choppiness right here. I can just kind of just my gut feeling is that we're going to be seeing some choppiness personally. Of course, we could grind above that, but I think anytime we're going to get close to the 7,000, I think that's going to be a strong resistance point. It's going to be hard to break through that. Once I think there's that push through that 7,000, just that psychological large resistance level, then I think it's like, okay, where are we at now? What's the AI buildout look like going forward? That's what we're going to be waiting to see. However, we could be experiencing some choppiness here, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if you have a long-term perspective on this whole AI industrial buildout. Uh, one of the big names that's catching a good bid, and that is Hood. Hood had a nice nice local bottom here at 69 basically. Will that be the bottom? I mean, this has had a strong snapback here at 8621. Of course, it could continue to sell off, but it's back above its 200 moving day. You know, Hood's at a 77 billion market cap right now, and they got earnings tomorrow. So, that'll be a big indicator. Likely not going to be trading around the earnings play. Way too volatile and tricky there. But, you know, one of the big things in terms of his prediction market. Robin Hood here surges 5% that we saw after we have over $1 million in betting volume in Super Bowl prediction market. So, the amount of income just from prediction markets that Robin Hood is bringing is very, very important for their balance sheet. So, we'll be keeping this on the radar. You know, definitely giving you guys an update out of the earnings report and we'll see what happens. In terms of stock futures, they're really not making any moves. Like I said, the SPY is just basically consolidating down 63. You know, we do have some of the names and things like that. Not a ton of crazy big earnings that will be released this week. I think what more specifically that people are going to be looking at, you got retail sales. However, on Wednesday, that's when you're going to get the US employment report. Uh that's going to be ma basically probably more macroeconomically persuading in terms of what's the justification for the current valuation of the market. In terms of earnings though, you got things like Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Cisco. So, some of the big ones, but not big tech earnings. And then you got existing home sales and the CPI data that'll come out for January that's going to be coming out on Friday. So, we do have some good pieces of macroeconomic data. We'll be keeping that on the radar and see kind of how this market operates. Uh, I think it's going to go quite interesting here. Don't think it's going to be just a straight line up or straight line down. I think there's going to be a lot of fake outs. There's going to be a lot of shakeouts. There's going to be a lot of rips. Uh, this year could be quite interesting, I think, until we see more concrete kind of directional movement in one way because the sides are swaying quite crazy. And on top of that, you don't have a ton of confidence still in Bitcoin. I mean, extreme figure is still at 10 right here. You got Bitcoin that's back underneath 70,000 is trying to hold 70,000 at this floor. Don't know how well it's doing. And Ethereum that's basically just trying to hold this 2100 at the floor, but it can't. It's kind of getting rejected there. Could there be further selling pressure? Of course, BMR right now at 2118. Uh, you know, these shareholders have been wrecked over the last uh, you know, 6 months when BMR was trading at a much higher higher higher price. So I Tom Lee still very bullish on what the future prediction of Ethereum is. I mean now is the chance for him just to sit here and accumulate accumulate accumulate dollar cost average and get to that 5% goal relatively quickly because now he's got more purchasing power uh basically with the same amount of money to accumulate more Ethereum. So we'll see what happens with that. Other than that quickly we can look at some of the agentic names. Zetta Path really not making any big moves today. Kind of just consolidating on the day. Uh so it'll be interesting to see here once he's kind of experienced a breakout. A lot of people on X especially very bullish on Zetta. I like Zetta. Um just kind of waiting for it to make some moves. So other than that, that's really all that I have for you guys. Hope you guys are all having a wonderful day out there. Peace out. Take care. And I'll catch you guys later. Have a wonderful night.",
