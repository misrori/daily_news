        "transcript": "Hello you animals. Today I have a few juicy clips for you. First, Gene Monster breaks down Tesla's Q4 results. Then Dan Ives makes the case that the AI spending wave is still accelerating and rippling into sectors you wouldn't expect. It's a really good mix of clips today. Check it out. >> I'll start with the pressure point which was any key updates on autonomy. And the first thing was this new metric they're giving out which is FSD subscriptions. And as someone who was a longtime analyst and now for the past decade been an investor in tech is that uh when companies take away and give metrics it's a read in terms of their confidence in the metric and so now they're giving this metric out for the first time uh those are up 30% year-over-year that would be the FS excuse me 38% year-over-year that's the number of FSD subscriptions and that outpaced the growth of the cumulative uh installed base of vehicles which is up about 20%. And so we had the subscriptions growing faster than the base which is a sign that the adoption is starting to uh quicken. That is to me probably the most important part because from that uh flows what happens with robo taxi and then to a lesser extent what happens with optimist. But that to me was the pressure point. the fact that they are now giving away FSD subscription metrics which might seem again a little bit underwhelming but I want to dive a little bit more into that FSD is making I think more progress than most people realize and yes we see it in that 38% subscription growth but just my own personal experience is that it has made a remarkable improvement uh over the last three six months and Elon on the call was asked when it's going to be 100% and he still used the word paranoid and used the word cautious and wouldn't give any timing on when he thought he would get there. But I think the substance of this is that my own experience and I think for those of you who have experienced the most recent version, you would agree that it is quite remarkable and I think the market doesn't fully understand that piece. So, we're getting closer to a point where people are going to increasingly value what's going on with FSD. There's a little bit of a nuance to the changes as they get rid of the upfront 8,000 and go go to a $99 a month in terms of how that impacts margins. I just want to quickly uh talk about that. The stock pulled back a little bit, a couple percent on that update, but effectively since they're not going to be recognizing a chunk, it's usually like 3,000 initially. It's just going to be the $99 of high margin business. It it does impact the overall margins. By my estimate, it would take the automotive gross margins X credits from 17.9% what they just reported down to 16, just to give you some context about the impact on margins. But overall, FSD continues to move forward. And the fact that they're showing us those numbers now, I think is evidence of they think this metric is going to show well in the future. Second update related to autonomy is on the robo taxi fleet. They talked about the middle of this year having adding seven new cities. They had talked about 8 to 10 total cities which would mean adding six to eight throughout calendar 26, but now they're going to do that in the first half of the year. And then he said more than a dozen by the end of the year. And so just the kind of the pace of the robo taxi roll out. He mentioned that the the number of uh vehicles will be doubling kind of month over month kind of growing exponentially. So a pretty high bar there but again I think that that all plays into confidence increasing confidence that they're having in the competency of FSD. Elon said there's still problems with it complicated intersections but it is making some meaningful improvements but that impacts kind of the robo taxi roll out. Fun fact, if you look at what the growth is with uh Whimo this year and add in Tesla to that, it's just over a percent and a half of total ride sharing miles will likely be autonomous. We're just scratching the surface. Uh the third topic in terms of optimist, not a lot there, said that we're still in more or less testing phase. He referred to as R&D phase and so he expects to be selling them next year, but really wasn't any big X factors around that. So that was the pressure point. The one topic that did not get addressed is how to think about deliveries for calendar 26. That did not come up. They did not give any feedback on that. The streets looking for up I think about 7% in calendar 26 over 25. My sense is it's going to be flattish. As long as it's flat, I think it's going to be a positive. If it ends up being down 10%, that's a problem. I don't think we'll get there in part because of these lowerpriced Model Y and X. So, those are the big ones. A quick postcript kind of uh say goodbye to the S and X potentially. Those are going to be collector's items. Now, I just love the fact that the company is focusing again on models that are going to be higher volume. Model Y, Model 3 and the Robo Taxi, excuse me, the Cyber Cab. And again, this all kind of plays into the importance of FSD and and the progress that it's made. So the oneliner is FSD is making progress and that kind of feeds the whole business. >> Tesla publicly sharing FSD subscription metrics for the first time singles they expect the adoption curve to be climbing. I'm super excited for Tesla to be revealing their FSD subscriptions. I personally believe for this to be really and truly meaningful for Tesla's business model, we need to be getting to around 5 million subscriptions at 199 bucks per driver or or I should say per car or 10 million at 99 bucks each. I think as the functionality goes up, Tesla will find a higher price point. And I also caveat with this, the reason I think it needs to get to a billion dollars for it to be significant, even though this should be mainly profit margin is because by the time I think Tesla gets to, let's say, 10 million subscribers, Robbiti is probably going to be ramping pretty hard. Not financial advice, just my thoughts. So, back to Jean's clip. He made a subtle point about how companies handle metrics. When Tesla starts sharing a new number publicly, it means they're confident that number will look good going forward. They wouldn't give us FSD subscription data unless they thought it was going to keep climbing. And 38% growth versus 20% fleet growth tells you existing owners are converting at a faster rate than new cars are hitting the road. So, the product itself has been improving quietly. Gene mentioned that his own experience with FSD over the past few months, and I've heard the same thing from other owners. The system handles situations now that would have tripped it over a year ago. Every Tesla on the road feeds back data. Weird intersections, construction zones, someone cutting you off late at night. That's millions of edge cases being discovered and solved constantly. Competitors running simulations can't match that velocity. For robo taxi, Elon still says complicated intersections are a problem, but trajectory matters more than perfection right now. Dean's other point about them pushing out the S and X is interesting. Tesla is focusing entirely on high volume, the Y and the 3 and the Cyber Cab. They're betting everything on scale and autonomy rather than trying to compete in the luxury sedan market. It tells you exactly where they think the real opportunity is. And if you want to understand how AI like FSD actually learns and improves, I've built a course called the AI landscape that breaks all of this kind of stuff down. Links in the description below. You get lifetime access and the price only goes up as we add new modules. So Tesla's making progress on the autonomy side. Now let's talk about the infrastructure powering all of this AI. In this clip, Dan Ies breaks down why the AI spending wave is still accelerating and why the bubble crowd keeps getting it wrong. >> Now they're trading at 30 times 27 earnings. That's the difference between a bubble and and and and and growth. >> And for every dollar spent on Nvidia chip, there's an $8 multiplier across the rest of tech, >> right? And it speaks to our view that like you're just starting to see the ripple effect second, third, fourth derivatives play out across tech. So I view it where you know when they talk about bubble you're underestimating what the growth is going. You have more data centers under construction active data centers. >> The capback's going to be 550 or 600 billion. We're to go into January. You're going to see numbers continue to move higher. And I think that's something that the street is underestimating. >> Right. These are the two stories that are going to carry. Look, somebody was asking me this morning, what do I think is going to carry this market through the first quarter, right? Obviously, interest rate story is and how that pans out. You were the one who did make it clear to everyone that the chance of us not getting a cut in December was the same as you playing, right, for for for NFL and me being the center for the New York Knicks. So, we know you were right once again and you were right way more often than you're wrong. But what's great is that we both are able to make a culpa when we make a mistake and we're not clear like February, March, and April. We we said totally we when we are in it, we did not see the the the the golden ticket at the end of the at the end of the rainbow. We didn't we didn't couldn't put our minds, you know, in in Mr. Trump's head. Fortunately, not a place I want. No disrespect to the big guy, but anyway, first quarter, you see tech continuing to be as robust as if Ripples's >> financials, energy, healthcare, >> right? >> Those are derivatives industrials of AI trade. I mean, when you think about like JP Morris, some of the bigger banks, I mean, they're trading at all-time highs. So, I think it I think it just shows like so much of the growth that's happening here is AIdriven. You're going to cut rates. You're going to get obviously a power placement, you know, probably in the next week or two probably named, okay, much more dovish. That sets up for what I view as a bullish market, you know, going into this. >> Now, just to bring in not not politics, but just what's going on globally. Obviously, we just had a little situation with with Venezuela and obviously, but it's a bullish. Explain to me why you see it as a bullish. >> It goes back to my view like with Israel and US in terms of Iran. When they took Iran out, it's bull the black swan event is off the table, right? Venezuela, it's another like, you know, bad dude that's now not going to, you know, especially when it comes to energy, >> right? To some extent, you could say oil is probably going a lot lower just given what we see in terms of Venezuelan supply versus I just see I view it as when these events happen, >> you have to be able to kind of see the forest through the trees >> in terms of what it means whether it's Middle East or Venezuela as a and we always say like >> it's very like the bears will watch this party >> right >> through the windows, >> right? And I'm not saying glass on dance bag >> with a bag of chips and and a slushie. >> And they're going to bag a chip, slushie, go up to their room at 6:00 a.m. when the bull when the party's over. And I don't think that's for a number of years. >> The Bulls had a lot better night than the Bears. >> If you if you look historically through various economic cycles going back even into the 1980s, low energy costs historically fuel strong economies. >> Okay. and and it's and think about from an inflation perspective. >> It's it's always a key driver in terms of the lifting of economic growth is if you can lower energy costs over time. >> And we know that oil is right. Go ahead. >> To Dan's point, you know, Venezuela, I mean, there's obviously there's a lot of uncertainty there. There's a lot of work to do. There are a lot of very smart people that will get involved, right, in trying to figure out how to bring Venezuela, this untapped resource to market. But in general, Dan saying, oil prices coming down, gas prices coming down. This is all very positive for everything including AI. >> It's another reason that Tuckman should have the 7,000 S&P at >> We do. We do. We are. We are 50. This is the question. We know that Poly Market and Couchy exist. These are predictive marketplaces. And the thing that I threw out yesterday was what do we think? Is it going to be Dow 50,000 first or S&P 7,000? I don't know. Liquidity. What do you think? Dow 50,000 or S&P 7,000? Which does it hit first? >> 50,000. >> 50,000 on the Dow. Okay. I think they're close. We're at 491 on the Dow. We're at 69 and change here. These are landmark numbers. These are huge. And so, and and people think, \"Oh, it's just another number.\" It's not. >> Every dollar spent on Nvidia's chips creates an 8 to10 multiplier across the rest of tech. And that's now ripping into different sectors, finance, energy, and healthcare. Dan's point about the multiplier effect is underappreciated. When a company buys Nvidia's GPUs, they also need data centers, cooling systems, power infrastructure, networking equipment, software tools, and engineers to build on top of it all. That's why you're seeing record highs across sectors that don't seem obviously connected to AI. The spending flows through the entire economy in ways that aren't immediately obvious. The stat that jumped out to me, there are more data centers currently under construction than there are active data centers right now. We haven't even built half of the AI infrastructure that's already being funded and committed. The capex numbers Dan showing around is real money flowing into concrete and steel and chips. Contracts that have already been signed. The AI buildout is generating real cash flow. These companies are profitable and growing. That's a fundamentally different situation than we had 25 years ago during the dotcom bubble with all the dark fiber. The question is always when does this slow down? And Dan's answer is essentially not yet. We're in the early innings of every company figuring out how to use AI and that means demand for compute keeps rising. Could something derail this? Sure. But betting against the AI buildout has been a losing trade for 2 years straight and the fundamentals haven't changed. If you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing. Cheers. Picture this.
