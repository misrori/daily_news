        "transcript": "As the first month of 2026 comes to a close, crypto investors everywhere are wondering what could happen next. Should we be bullish or should we be bearish? Will the crypto market continue declining or will altcoins finally get their time to shine? Will institutions keep on accumulating or will they turn their back on us when we need them most? These are the questions on everyone's mind. And given how disappointing 2025 was, despite all the bullish tailwinds and catalysts, it's hard to predict what will make this year any different. Well, thankfully, a recent report could have the answers. That's why today we're breaking this report down for you in simple terms, telling you exactly how investors felt about 2025, what they see happening next, and what this all means for the year ahead. My name is Lewis, and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Before we begin though, you need to know that I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. It's educational content intended to inform you about a recent crypto report that explores what could happen in Q1 of 2026. So, if that sounds good, well, prove it by pounding that like button and let's get into it. The report we'll be summarizing today is titled quote, \"Charting crypto Q1 2025.\" It was jointly published by Coinbase's institutional arm and Glass Node, a leading data analytics platform. As always, we'll be giving you the juiciest details right here in this video, but we'll leave a link down to the full report in the description below if you're interested. Now, the report begins by revealing the results of an eight question survey which had 148 respondents. 75 of these were institutional while the remaining 73 were non-institutional, aka retail investors. So almost a perfect 50/50 split. First, investors were asked about their risk levels. In Q3 last year, 59% of institutions reported taking on normal risk. But by Q4, sentiment was split between normal and higher risk at 42% and 41% respectively. As for retail investors, 56% took normal risk in Q3, dropping to 43% in Q4 as 50% of investors shifted towards higher risk, which is interesting given the draw down in the market. Next, investors were asked which phase of the crypto market cycle that we're in. In Q3, 45% of institutions believed we were in the late stages of a bull market. By Q4, views were far more mixed. 23% said accumulation. 21% pointed to the late stage of a bull market and 26% believe we're already in a bare market. Among retail investors, views were fairly evenly split between accumulation, a bull market, that is, you know, when prices stop moving sideways and start moving upwards, and the late stages of the bull market. By Q4, however, the share of retail believing we're in a thick of a bull market fell from 29% to 16%. while those saying that we're now in a bare market soaring from 6% in Q3 to 21% in Q4. Respondents were then asked about the biggest tail risk to crypto over the next 3 to 6 months for both institutional and retail investors in both Q3 and Q4. The top concern was the macro backdrop. This was followed by declining liquidity as the second largest risk and underwhelming crypto regulation as the third. Other tail risks include geopolitical tensions, industry specific failures such as a crypto treasury company being forced to sell, or cryptospecific failures like major hacks or exploits. Notably, these responses were almost universal and didn't change all that much between Q3 and Q4. Next, investors were asked about the most likely outcome for Bitcoin dominance over the next 3 to 6 months. In Q3, 39% of institutional investors expected dominance to remain between 55 and 60%. while 33% said that it would fall below 55, implying a rally in altcoins. Meanwhile, 28% said Bitcoin dominance would rise above 60%. Q4 saw a clear shift away from expectations of an altcoin rally. The share of institutions predicting Bitcoin dominance below 55% fell from 33% in Q3 to just 16% in Q4. Instead, 40% now expect dominance to rise above 60%. While 44% said that it will stay between 55 and 60. Retail investors predicted the same trend, albeit with less certainty. 41% predicted that Bitcoin dominance would rise above 60% while 34% said that it will hold steady at 55 to 60% and 24% said that Bitcoin dominance would fall below 55%. Next, the report shows results from four additional questions asked in December. The first asked whether Bitcoin was overvalued, fairly valued, or undervalued. Impressively, 71% of institutions and 60% of retail investors said BTC was undervalued, which is extremely bullish. Even more encouraging, just 4% of institutions said BTC was overvalued. 4%. Respondents were then asked how likely small cap cryptos would outperform large cap cryptos over the next 12 months. Retail investors were evenly split between likely, unlikely, and unsure. Meanwhile, 32% of institutional investors said small cap cryptos will outperform, while 45% said that it was unlikely. Next, investors were asked how they responded after the October 10th liquidation. Impressively, 60% of institutions either held firm or bought the dip, as did 70% of retail investors. Meanwhile, 38% of institutions either reduced positions, increased hedging, or rotated into other cryptos. Just 31% of retail investors did this, too. Although, intriguingly, 11% said that they took this as an opportunity to rotate. Finally, investors were asked how they'd react if crypto fell 10% or more in the short term. And again, investors showed their conviction. 80% of institutions said they'd hold or buy the dip, as did 85% of retail investors. So overall then, this survey showed that while investors are perhaps more cautious than they were in Q3, they were certainly not going anywhere anytime soon. Okay, so the next part of the report takes a look at the crypto market's performance in Q4 last year. But before we get into that, you need to know about the new and improved Coinb Telegram channel. We recently plugged it into some of the best APIs to give you important crypto updates in real time, allowing you to stay on top of the market without having to doom scroll on X. And so, if that sounds useful, then join the Coin Bureau Telegram channel by using the link below or by scanning the QR code on the screen. But back to the report, which notes that Bitcoin hit its all-time high of over 125K shortly before the October liquidation event. Despite the draw down that followed, Bitcoin's dominance stayed relatively unchanged. By contrast, midcap and small cap altcoins took a beating even with the launch of multiple altcoin ETFs. This sent the altcoin season index plummeting as any optimism for parabolic altcoin rallies evaporated. The report then looks at the Coinbase 50 index, which tracks the top 50 cryptos by market cap. As you'd expect, Q4 was a bloodbath across the board. ETH fell 28%. XRP dropped 34%. Soul slid 40% and ADA plunged 56%. You get the idea. In fact, the only exception was BCH, which gained 7% in Q4. Though, unless you're, you know, a Bitcoin Cash Maxi, that's probably not much comfort. Then, the report zooms in on BTC's price action across all four completed cycles, each with their own bull and bare markets. However, the current cycle began to decouple as early as Q1 last year when long-term holders started de-risking. Even so, the report notes that quote, \"It's unclear if these patterns are still relevant,\" adding that quote past performance does not indicate future results. Damn straight. On the other hand, ETH has gone through quote at least two cycles, also featuring bull and bare markets. Although notably, the report places different time horizons for ETH cycle. According to the report, BTC is 36 months into the current cycle, where ETH is 42 months into its own market cycle. In any case, ETH cycle has decoupled even more significantly from previous cycles with ETH's price action remaining relatively flat overall. The report suggests this could be a normal late cycle dynamic where capital rotation fades or a sign that Ethereum market structure has basically matured, meaning future performance may hinge on utility, regulatory clarity, and adoption. The report then examines crypto's correlation with other assets, noting that Bitcoin's linked to stocks remain significant despite huge differences in performance. However, the real takeaway is that Bitcoin's correlation with gold is almost non-existent. While BTC struggled to pull any meaningful gains in 2025, gold finished the year as a top performing asset, not a great look for the digital gold narrative. Liquidity is up next, and the report compares BTC's performance against the M2 money supply of eight major economies. BTC's correlation with liquidity remains positive, at least for now. If M2 begins to tighten, though, then we should probably be more cautious about BTC's price action in Q1 this year. Luckily though, most economists expect M2 Money supply conditions to become less restrictive with modest growth continuing into early 2026. Now, the next part of this report looks at several metrics to assess Bitcoin's performance. Starting with entity adjusted net unrealized profit and loss or nil. It's quite the mouthful, but basically it measures how much unrealized profit or loss Bitcoin wallets are sitting on. The entity adjusted bit just means multiple wallets belonging to the same person or entity have been grouped together. This is a useful metric because it gives us a clear indicator of investment sentiment. The report notes that after the October liquidation event, investor sentiment, as implied by the null, went from belief to anxiety, and it really didn't budge for the rest of the year. Next, the report looks at Bitcoin's market value and realized value or MVRV. Basically, it measures the ratio between the current price and how much profit the average BTC holder is in. So, if the MVRV is at two, well, that just means that the average Bitcoin holder is up 2x. While if it's at 0.85, well, that means that they're down 15%. Logically, the more people that are in profit, the more likely investors will sell to cash in their gains. As the chart provided in the report shows, Bitcoin's MVRV is around 2.2, 2, which suggests most investors are at least 2x up on their Bitcoin positions. Nothing too crazy, but it could be part of the reason why BTC has experienced so much selling pressure. Next comes an examination of BTC's supply profitability, which tracks the percentage of Bitcoin supply held in profit and plots it against two statistical bands set at +1 and minus1. When the price is near the minus1 band, this typically signals an accumulation zone. while being near the plus one band serves as a warning zone. In Q4, after the October drawdown and BTC was forced down to around 80K, BTC supply profitability plummeted down to the negative one band. This suggests that many Bitcoin investors accumulated between 80,000 and 85,000. The report then compares BTC's dormant and active supply. For those unaware, any BTC that hasn't moved in the past 12 months is considered dormant, while active supply includes any BTC moved within the last 3 months. Basically, it's used to gauge who's holding and who's more actively trading. BTC's active supply increased by a whopping 37% in Q4, which isn't all that surprising given how suddenly the market and specifically BTC's price crashed after the October liquidation event. However, BTC's dormant supply fell by just 2%, suggesting the market may be shifting towards more active trading rather than long-term holding. The report then examines BTC's pure multiple is calculated by dividing BTC's daily issuance value in USD by the 365day moving average, effectively comparing price to historical minor revenue. This helps identify zones of minor sell pressure and can reveal whether BTC may be overbought or oversold. Notably, Bitcoin's pure multiple dropped to 0.9 in Q4, which indicates that miners are earning 10% less than they have done historically. If we understand correctly, then this one's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, it could mean that miners have less incentive to sell. On the other hand, though, it could also mean that miners have to sell more BTC in order to keep the lights on. Then the report looks at the net change in positions from long-term holders with long-term defined as BTC held over 155 days or more. By comparing this with the net change in exchange positions, it could help identify periods of profit taking. Based on this, the report concludes that July to September may have represented a phase where long-term holders began trading some of their long-term BTC positions. Okay, so the final section of the report pivots from Bitcoin to Ethereum. Starting with ETH Snoopal, which we'll remind you is basically used to measure investor sentiment. The report notes that sentiment as measured by the null swung wildly throughout 2025. It hit capitulation in Q1 2025 as ETH formed a local bottom, climbed to optimism in Q3 when ETH reached new all-time highs, and then fell back to fear in Q4. In short, 2025 was a roller coaster for ETH holders. Then the report looks at ETH's market value and realized value or MVRV which measures the average realized and unrealized loss of ETH holders. Similar to BTC, ETH's MVRV is sitting around 2.2, which means that most ETH holders are at least 2x up on their positions since they bought in, which could also explain why ETH has struggled. Long-term holders selling. Next up is ETH's supply profitability, which uses those plus1 and minus1 bands that we mentioned earlier. Early in 2025, ETH's price volatility pushed its supply profitability down to around 0.4, meaning roughly 40% of ETH supply was in profit. When ETH hit its all-time high, this surged to the plus one band with nearly every holder in profit. However, this quickly reversed in the tail end of the year, leaving many ETH holders in the red. Then the report analyzes ETH's dormant and active supply. ETH's dormant supply dropped by 9% in Q4 after the October drawd down compared to BTC's 2%. Which suggests that more long-term ETH holders were spooked. As the report explains, quote, \"This suggests that some long-term holders began distributing or reallocating coins amid recent market weakness, even though short-term activity may have cooled.\" And finally, we're shown two eyeopening charts. first shows the number of transactions on Ethereum and its layer 2s which have been gradually rising since January of 2023. Each major upgrade, Denun, Pekra, and Fusaka have sparked surges in trading activity, though trading volumes did taper off somewhat after the latest Fusaka upgrade. The second chart shows Ethereum and layer 2 user fees since January of 2023. What's awesome is that while transaction volumes have risen, user fees have actually been falling largely thanks to the Denune upgrade, which you might recall was a major step for layer 2 scalability and efficiency. This caused fees to fall off a cliff, and they've stayed low ever since. Well, at least compared to what they used to be. Still though, this is exactly what Ethereum needs to do if it's going to continue its path towards institutional adoption. And with that, we've reached the end of this report. And remember, you can find the full thing in the description below. For now, though, there's just one question remaining. What does this mean for the crypto market in 2026? Well, we all know that market conditions aren't where we'd like them to be. But if there's one thing to take away from this report, it's a sense of hope. Even with a bare market on the horizon, both retail and institutional investors are surprisingly riskone. Recall the results of that survey at the start of the report. 71% of institutions think BTC is undervalued, which means that they're probably not planning to sell if the price dips even further. If anything, they're more likely to keep accumulating. This is a bigger deal than you might think because if retail and institutional investors buy the dip, well, this could prevent BTC's price falling so dramatically in the bare market. And you really only need to look at the October draw down to see the evidence of this. Even when BTC plummeted by 10% in a single day, most investors either held on strong or they even added more to their positions. This will be especially true if gold's performance begins to taper off. Let's not beat around the bush, okay? I mean, gold has been eating BTC's lunch for quite some time now, but this momentum won't last forever. Once gold's price starts to fall, investors could turn to other assets for upside potential, and Bitcoin, aka digital gold, could be the first stop. That said, BTC is also running out of steam, at least in this cycle. To be frank, there doesn't seem to be many catalysts remaining that could keep BTC moving up higher for longer. And when you recall that most investors are at least 2x up on their positions, well, this does play significant sell pressure on BTC in the short to medium term. The same is arguably true for ETH. Ethereum is already making big moves on the institutional front, hosting the bulk of tokenized real world assets and the stable coin market, two huge draws for institutions. And with the upcoming Glamsterdam and Hagod upgrades expected this year, Ethereum's scalability will see a major boost. helping to strengthen Ethereum's institutional appeal. This could give ETH's price a meaningful boost despite the apparent sell pressure from long-term holders and reignite optimism across the wider altcoin market. So, as long as market conditions don't deteriorate too far, regulation keeps supporting innovation, and we're not hit with any major macro shocks, well, 2026 could end up being the year that we all hoped 2025 would be. Well, I mean, fingers crossed to that. At the very least, let's just hope that 2026 is a bit more interesting, right? And that's going to be it. So, quite enough from me. But now, we want to hear from you. What do you expect to see in 2026? Are you bullish or are you bearish? Let us know in the comments below. And if you're looking to reshape your portfolio for the year ahead, well, then check out that video right over here.
