        "transcript": "If you own any AI stocks right now, what I'm about to show you could be the difference between protecting your wealth and watching it evaporate going into 2026. The AI stock correction has already wiped out literally hundreds of billions of dollars in market value. We've got Oracle down 48%. We've got Olo down 61%. INQ down 46%. And this isn't just about a few stocks. This is about a big wealth transfer happening right now while most investors are still completely unprepared. The question isn't if you'll be affected, it's whether you'll be on the winning side or on the losing side of what is actually coming next. My name is Felix P. I'm an ex investment banker. That's Winston back there who's the brains behind the whole thing in the research here. And I've seen how banks work from the inside. I've been investing for over a decade and I'm also the founder of the goat academy where we've taught about 20,000 students how to navigate the market more like professionals. I'm also the co-founder of tradevision.io where we give you institutional grade news and data. So, I'm dedicating my retirement to teaching you how to protect yourself from the schemes and the financial engineering out there because the truth is they're not really trying to help you, right? They're trying to get rich off you. That's kind of how it works. So, what have we done for this video here? Well, Winston's analyzed Fed policy, tracked every major AI stock correction, studied historical tech tech crashes on.com all the way through to today, fact checked every single number you're about to see. So, this is not fear-mongering. I'm not saying AI is over. I'm not s saying sell your AI stocks. This isn't clickbait. This is just facts. And by the end of the video, you will know how to position yourselves better, not just to survive this correction, but potentially profit from what's coming next. So, I'm going to break down three things for you. One, the brutal numbers. Exactly what's happened to AI and Momentum stocks as I'm recording this and why this correction was inevitable. Two, the hidden mechanism driving this crash. It's not what people think. It goes way deeper than overvaluation. And then three, your exact action plan. What to actually potentially want to buy, what to avoid, how to position your portfolio for the opportunities that always emerge after these corrections. So you'll understand exactly what's happening, why it's happening, and most importantly, what you might want to do about it. So let's dive in, shall we? Let me show you what's actually happened here. This is recording in towards in December 2025. This is wealth getting destroyed, right? Brutal corrections from 52- week highs. Oracle down 48%. We've got Bloom Energy down 48%. Oracle down 61%. Centress Energy down 52%. Iris Energy on 56%. Nvidia down 19%. These are like the champions of the AI world. Now, if your stomach just dropped because you own some of these stocks, well, don't panic yet. We're going to talk about what to do, but first you need to understand the facts. Oh, there is more. By the way, I didn't want to upset you too much, but there's a second slide with more carnage, but this is important. At the same time, the S&P is up almost 18%. The NASDAQ is down 12% from its recent highs. So, this is not a market crash. This is a sector rotation. This is what I call selective correction. And that's actually good news if you know how to play it. I always say follow the money. The money moves from industry to industry and that's what it's doing right now. The Fed just cut interest rates third time in 2025. Inflation is sitting at 2.9%. That's important to put that all together. So the problem is this. All of the money that flooded into AI stocks in 2023 2024 was based on hope and hype and future potential. Now we're at the end of 2025 and the market is asking where are my profits? And a lot of these companies don't have a good answer, right? They just keep saying, \"Well, AI will fix it, but they're not very specific about it.\" And look, we've seen this before. Winston has seen this before as well. He's getting up. We've seen this pattern before. So, let me take you back through history briefly because if you understand the pattern, you can benefit from it. The dotcom bubble in 2000, everybody thought the internet was going to change everything. They were right about that, but they were wrong about the timing and which companies would win. Companies with zero revenue were valued in the billions just because they had a com in their name. And literally my office building, it was named.com house. I kid you not. They've lately renamed that. But there are companies like Pets.com. They spent $300 million on advertising, but they made basically no money. They went bankrupt. The NASDAQ dropped 78% from its peak. Companies like Amazon dropped 90%. But here's the thing, Amazon survived. If you bought Amazon in 20 in 2001, well, you'd be a schoolionaire by now. So, the lesson, the tech was real, the opportunity was real, but the valuations got way ahead of reality. If you look at 2008, the problem wasn't tech, it was debt. Banks had leveraged in times 30 to1 40 to1 and well there was fraud in the housing sector. So when housing prices stopped going up the whole system collapsed the NASDAQ as the S&P rather dropped 57%. But if you had the courage to buy stocks in March 2009 you would have made 400% by 2020. What about co the market drops 34% right? got a percent a day. Fastest crash in history. Everyone's freaking out. The economy is done. We're going into depression, right? Hopefully pharma will save us. Uh anyway, so what happened? Well, the Fed printed trillions of dollars. Stocks recovered. If you bought the dip, well, you would have made massive gains. So, what's happening today? We've got a sector specific correction. AI stocks run up hard in 2023 and 2024. Did I say AI or did I say or or OI stocks? I'm becoming Irish or something. Nvidia went from 120 to $210 in less than two years. And the same story with things like INQ 300% up and so on. But the reality is setting in. AI infrastructure costs are massive. Commercial revenues are developing. Competition is intensifying. and valuations. Well, they got a little bit ahead of uh what's actually happening. Now, does this mean AI is dead? No. AI is going to change the world just like the internet did. But just like 2000, we're seeing a correction where the market separates the winners from the losers. And the smart investors, well, they're positioning themselves right now to buy the winners at discount prices. At least that's my humble opinion. Now, before I show you the real reason this correction is happening, and I think it's not what you think, I want to invite you to something special. I'm going to hold a live session between the holidays, December 26th, December, sorry, December 27th, and I'm going to reveal why I am putting a million dollars of my own money into an experiment to beat the S&P 500 in just 15 minutes a week. It's not complicated day trading. It's not spending hours glued to charts. just the exact rule-based system that we've been working on that is based on what Wall Street does and we call a trend monster. That's sort of the core part of that. I got on the screen here. This is going to be inside of the private community that we have. But I'm going to walk you through how that works. And if you're curious why I would put a million dollars of my own cash into something like this and aim to prove that it works, and I might well be wrong on that, by the way. I could lose that money, then join me and start your 2026 with a better understanding of how institutional frameworks attack markets like these in any other markets. There's a link down below to grab yourself a free seat for that live training. felixfriends.org/training. It's free. All you got to do is show up. Will there be a replay? No. Why not? People don't watch them. And I know you always think, \"Oh, but I'd be different. I'd watch it.\" Yeah, but statistically that's just not true. So, we don't do replays. People just don't show up for it. If you want to show up for yourself, show up live December 27th and we're going to have some tremendous fun together. Now, back to the hidden mechanism here that's driving this AI correction. Most people just think, oh, it's just overvalued. And yeah, you know, there's stocks like INQ that were valued at 200 times sales. Oracle's PE was kind of mad. But that isn't actually the full story because if that was just all about valuations, all expensive stocks would be dropping. But they're not. Some are actually going up. The real reason this correction is happening comes down to three interconnected factors that Wall Street doesn't really want you to understand because when you understand them, you stop being their uh mic, right? You start being their competition, which is really what we're doing here. So, what is it all about? Well, the first factor now, well, the first factor blew my mind when I started digging into it. These AI companies aren't just raising money through stock offerings. They're using really complex financing arrangements that involve massive amounts of debt. Oracle was in talks with Blue Owl Capital for a $10 billion funding deal to build a Michigan data center. Apparently, that deal got stalled. The stock collapsed. Why does that matter? Because Oracle's business model for AI involves building massive data centers and costs billions and billions of dollars. But the revenue from those data centers won't come for years. Or we have companies like Coreweave. It's a major AI infrastructure player. They have zero profit but billions in debt. Yet they secured huge partnerships with tech giants through something called equity for f equity for future profits arrangements. So here's what's happening. These companies are promising future AI revenues to justify today's spending. But we've seen this movie be right. In 2008, banks promised future housing profits to justify present- day lending. Those profits didn't materialize. Well, everything collapsed. I'm not saying we're headed for a 2008 star crisis. By the way, AI is real. The demand is real. But the timing of when these companies become profitable, that's where the risk is. And right now the market is starting to wake up to that risk. The second factor up we're going to talk about the Fed because what they're doing right now is a very very dangerous game. The Fed just cut interest rates down to 3.5%. Third consecutive cut in a year. On the surface that sounds great, right? It's great for stocks. Lower rates means more money flowing into the market. But the catch is that inflation is still what is it? 2.7 or something like that. um well above their 2% target. So let's think about this 3.5% interest rate. Say it's a 2.9% inflation. I think it's two 2.7. It doesn't really matter. So what do you get to? Well, you get to about a 0.8% real interest rate. Barely positive. The United States has an almost 0% real interest rate. It's not a banana republic. is the United States. So, the Fed's in a trap. If they cut rates too much, what do you think is going to happen to inflation? Well, inflation's going to spike, isn't it? Which what happens if inflation spikes? Well, the Fed has to raise rates. That would crash the market. And then think about all the debt these AI companies are piling up. Well, the cost of that debt could therefore increase. So, this is a high-risk strategy the Fed's playing there. And AI companies will be the first to get hurt if the Fed is wrong. Because when money is cheap and plentiful, investors take risk. They buy speculative stocks. They bet on the future. But when money gets slightly more expensive or when there's uncertainty out there, those speculative bets are the first to get sold. People put into something more reliable. And that's what we're seeing here. All right. Here's the third factor. And this is actually good news. In investing, they're generally two types of stocks. Growth stocks, these are companies that are growing fast but might not be profitable yet. Think, you know, INQ, Ollo, AI startups. You buy them for what they will be worth in the future. And then you have value stocks. These are companies that are profitable now. They pay dividends. They're more stable. Utilities, banks, healthcare, that sort of thing. What's happening right now is a rotation. Money is moving out of the growth stocks and into the value stocks. Why? Because when there is uncertainty, when interest rates are choppy, when there is geopolitical madness happening, those investors want safety. Now, what's safer? A company that's profitable today or one that's promising you it's going to be profitable in five years, you know, sort of fugazi stuff. So, futility stocks up, consumer staple stocks up, defense contractors up, healthcare is looking good, right? Gold and silver is looking extraordinary. But AI stocks are down 40 to 60%. That is actually normal market behavior. It happens in every cycle. Growth stocks lead when times are good and everyone's optimistic. Value stocks lag and then they lead in uncertain times. And what does it tell us? This correction in AI stocks is actually part of a healthy market cycle. That is the market saying, \"Okay, we got a little bit too excited, right? Let's take a breather and reassess. We took a little bit snort of a little bit too much AI stuff. Now it hurts if you're holding these stocks. Yeah. But does it mean the opportunity is over? No. So now you understand what's happening, right? You understand the debt trap, the Fed tightroppe, the growth to value rotation. But understanding does not make you money. Action makes you money. So I'm going to give you the exact playbook for navigating this correction. Now, this is of course my opinion. I'm not giving you financial advice. So be smart about it. Use the the gray matter between the ears. what to do if you're already in these stocks, what to avoid, what to look for, and how to position yourself for the opportunity that comes after this. So, I'm going to give you a simple framework. Okay, it's action plan time. So, what do you do if you're already holding Oracle, Nvidia, INQ, or any of these beaten down AI stocks? Well, don't panic, right? Let me explain. When a stock drops 40%, 50% or 60%, your instinct is to stop the bleeding and sell. Well, you probably should have had a stop and got out earlier and actually kept some of those gains, but now it's too late for that. What happens if you panic sell? Well, you lock in your losses at the worst possible price probably. So, let's say you are sitting at, you know, 50% losses. Well, I'm not saying you should hold and hope. That's how people really lose money. So, what have you got to do? Well, you got to evaluate the fundamentals. You got to ask yourself these questions. If the company is the company profitable or is it on a clear path to profitability, right? And then you got to look at some of those companies and you say, \"Okay, well, Nvidia, is it profitable? Are they printing money?\" Yes. Right. What about INQ? No. They're pre-revenue. They're burning cash. They have strong partnerships or customer commitments. Well, some, right? What about Oracle? Yeah, they got major cloud customers. Tik Tok, right? They're now the backbone of Tik Tok. Oklo has government contracts but no commercial license yet. So, can they survive? Check how much cash they have. Check how much the cash they're burning, right? Who can survive? That's where you want to be. And if you don't think they can survive or if you're doubtful about it, you're better to take 50% of your money than end up with zero. Now, Nvidia down 19% is probably an opportunity. Again, not telling you to buy it. Or close down 61%. Years away from revenue. Well, that's a lot riskier, right? you have a really serious risk tolerance for that. So, what do you want to avoid? Don't catch falling knives. A stock that falls 50%, it can drop another 50%, and then another 50%, right? So, this is just not something that's a smart thing to do. Falling knives are very painful. Just think about it. You drop it, it just hits your foot, right? Painful. So, wait for signs of stabilization. Wait for a base to form. There's a pattern to the stock market. This is a bad one. And don't average down on losing stocks. Now, if you are buying an index fund, you can average down as much as you want. It works. It does not work for stocks. The risk just gets greater. So, if your stock's down 40% and you're going to buy more to lower my average cost, well, that only works the company's fundamentals are still strong. You're averaging down on a company that's broken. You're just throwing good money after bad because you're not wanting to realize that loss. And number three is revenge trading. Emotions are running pretty high with a lot of people right now. So if you lost money on IQ, so now you want to make a quick buck, right? So you're going to buy the next hot AI stock. And that's emotion. It's not strategy. That's how you turn a 40% loss into a 70% loss. And then the worst thing I really see with people in I see a lot of people's portfolios is the lack of risk management. If your stock's down 50, if your stock is 50% of your portfolio right now because everything else went down, that is too much risk in one position. You're going to want to rebalance in my humble opinion. You're going to want to take some of that off the table. I know it's hard to sell a loss. It's never fun. I've been there. I do it all the time. I do it every week, but I automate it so I don't have to press the button. Much much easier that way because protecting your capital means you can fight another day. That is always more important than hoping for a miracle. Now, what are the opportunities? Opportunity? Well, there is always opportunity. The obvious one is high quality AI stocks. You know, Nvidia is 90% cheaper. It's still the dominant AI chip player. Massive revenue, massive profits, massive margins, strong partnerships, right? Proven ability to execute. So, it could be interesting. And then you got the picks and shovels. So, during the gold rush, people who made the most money weren't the gold miners. There were the people selling picks and shovels in the AI boom. Who's selling the picks and shovels? It's the power in the utility companies. AI data center needs massive amounts of electricity. So companies that provide reliable power could be good. We have cooling infrastructure stocks. We have data center reats. Yes, real estate investment trusts that own data centers, physical locations. You got the semiconductor equipment guys, the companies that make the machines to make the chips. They don't care who wins. They want to make money anyway. We've also seen very strong defense plays. The government is going to spend more money on wars, right? Looks like the US is going to start another one with Venezuela. Uh why? Because well, it's profitable, isn't it? No, no. I'm sorry. I I was of course being a cynic. It is for the greater good of humanity somehow. You believe that? even if anything. Um now, so Santa also says healthcare and biotech are sectors to be be in. And why is that? And I've been very bullish on biotech for for most of the year. It is actually AI. AI makes biotech much faster, much more profitable, much much easier. And then you can always always always always go into good quality stocks, value stocks, right? Banks, utilities, consumer staples. I bought a stock two weeks ago called Metler Toledo. Hasn't done anything since, but it's a high quality company. What do they do? They do um precision weighing instruments for the pharma and biotech industry. Um and then there was a recurring revenue stream from from maintaining that equipment. So, you want to take a screenshot of these? I'm going to run through these quite quickly. Uh AI stocks here, defensive stocks, a couple of bit more detail on these here. Um now, when do we buy? You never know that it's the bottom of the market. Nobody does. So, you don't want to be buying because you think it's the bottom of the market. The way I look at it is, so a stock does this, it crashes, it goes sideways for a little while. When it starts to recover, that is sort of when I'm looking at it. I don't aim for the bottom. So, I aim for the recovery, not for the bottom. Um, base formation basically. We've done run tons of trainings on this in the past. If you haven't joined one of those yet, uh, well, at least join me on the 27th and I'll walk you through something even more fundamental. That's really like incredibly important. Um, and and so important. I mean, you're putting a million dollars in it. So, what else? Join us on Saturday. No, when when is the 27th? I never know what day of the week it is. It is a Saturday. Okay. Brilliant. Um, just after the Christmas feast, you can roll yourself off the uh the feast in front of a screen and and join me and I will literally walk you through my million dollars experiment. I'm going to be running that live for the foreseeable future for my students. Every single trade and so on will be shared. Uh the live session here is a an explanation of how that works of what it's all about, why we do it, why it's based, how it's based on the way institutions trade, and a very cool tool that we've built that I think makes that accessible to more people, provided you understand risk management, which is ultimately what this is all about. It's not a promise that you'll make lots of money. It's a promise to be transparent with you, to share this experiment with you, and to teach you structure. So, the link to this is down below in the description, felix/training. And I wish you a beautiful, calm, and relaxed start to the Christmas season. Happy Christmas. If you own Nvidia stock or you've been thinking about buying Amazon, or maybe you just are in an index fund, what I'm about to show you could change everything about your investment strategy. a massive 10 billion dollar"

        "transcript": "You can completely change your finances in six months if you follow the right system. By the end of this video, you will have a complete six month blueprint to fix your spending, crush your debt, and actually live the life you want. Step number one, this is your foundation, and it's also month one. This is where we define your rich life, and we create a clear plan to make it happen. If you skip this step, everything else falls apart. Everything that I'm going to teach you after this will be useless. This is not a video you just play and sort of Netflix out on the sofa over. This is one that's actually going to require you to do something. Get a piece of paper and write some stuff down. So ask yourself this, what do I actually care about? What kind of life do I want to live? What am I spending money on that I don't even care about? is [snorts] I want you to spend extravagantly of the things you love. Maybe it's travel, maybe it's concerts, maybe it's the best coffee every single morning. Whatever lights you UP and you got to decide which of these are important to you and it will be different for everybody. There is no right or wrong. There's travel, there is health, [snorts] there is relationships, and then there is convenience. And then for a lot of people, there is this one down here, social status. Yeah. One thing I learned to no longer care about at all. So, what I want you to do right now is literally in the comments, identify one money d that you love. The one that you spend, you know, $1,000, $5,000, 10K on if money dropped into your lap. There will, by the way, be a workbook which you can download. It'll be be down below in our community, felix.org/resource. You can download that so you can follow along. We'll try to put some steps in there so you can have some stuff to fill in and everything else. Look at those short-term goals, right? Those building blocks. So, the first is your shortterm stuff. And something like a big credit card bill will be something that would make you feel better if it wasn't there anymore, right? And then the second is long-term goals. That's the house. That's the starting a business. That's the retiring early. And with long-term plans and consistent investing, those long-term plans are 100% achievable. So again, I want you to make a plan. What are you going to do now? What are you going to do now? What are you going to do in the next 3 to 6 months? That's the starting block. Now could be, you know, pay debt. It could be build that emergency fund. And then after you've done three to six months, there's another category here which will be one to five years. And once you've done that, you can of course go down and do five years plus with longerterm stuff. Those goals are just as important as the short-term ones because they will give you a road map. You'll know where you're going because unless you know what your life, your rich life, your wonderful life looks like and then the goals that'll get you there, you're basically like a ship captain with no idea where you're going. Just useless, right? Going around in circles. And for those of you who just like, I just need my money to make more money for me. Okay, let me give you something in addition to this. Okay, bonus time. You want to learn literally from my mentors? You want to hop on one-on-one calls with my mentors, guys who've worked on Wall Street for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 years, even who managed billions of dollars for the big investment banks. You can chat with my team and see if that's something that is right for you. This call is a strategy call. It's an explanatory call. It is giving you the opportunity to ask rather all the questions and get them answered. And you can book that free call at felixfriend.org/freedom. There's a link down below in the description. You can just click on that. But let's get back into what I call the conscious spending plan. Because what if you could make sure that you're saving and investing enough each month and then use the rest of your money guilt-free on whatever you want, eating out, travel, whatever. It just takes a little bit of planning. So, here's how it works. Take home pay. This is how much you earn after taxes and deduction. That's the that's the foundation of your house. Next, you break your spending into four buckets. So, you've got bucket one, bucket two, bucket three, bucket four. Bucket one is your fixed expenses. That's typically 50% plus of most people's money. That's stuff like rent, utilities, groceries, transport, debt, stuff you have to pay, non-negotiables. Because you add all that up and then I would add another 15% on top because you will have forgotten something. Car repairs, medical bills, stuff you you need, right? Bucket two that is your investments. Now for most people that sits at about 10% maybe even less. This by the way number two is where the real wealth is created right? So think index funds or your investments, your stocks, all that kind of stuff. And then we have bucket number three, which is your savings. And for a lot of people, that's like 5 or 10%. We're going to want that to be at the very least 10%. What do I mean by savings? Well, it's things like saving for a house down payment for travel, piggy bank, emergency funds, short and midterm kind of savings stuff, right? And then number four is the guilt-free spending, the happy money. And for a lot of people, that's sort of 20 to 35% of spend. This frees you to spend guilt-free on what you love without worrying about all the rest of it. If there's no way you can at the moment spend 20 to 35% of your paycheck on the guilt-free stuff, well, maybe that's a gentle kick in the butt to finish watching the rest of this video to get your financial numbers in order, right? Sometimes you're flush and sometimes you're bust. And when you're up, it's never as good as it seems. And when you're down, you never think you're going to be up again. >> This is month one, right? You're like, \"Oh my god, this looks like work, doesn't it?\" Well, it's also going to give you freedom and happiness for the rest of your life. So, yeah, there's going to be a little bit of work involved. Month two, this is about building your own financial mode. The thing that makes you less vulnerable when life throws you a curveball, which is unfortunately going to happen. So, step one is what? Anybody? Step one is your emergency fund. Medical bills, car repairs, lose your job, anything like that. Without an emergency fund, you end up relying on credit cards or raiding your retirement accounts to pay for the essential. And that is a disaster. So my standard advice on this is 3 to 6 months of essential living expenses. So calculate your basics. Remember bucket one, right? Multiply that by 3 to six. That's basically it. Maybe it's $2,000. So you then multiply that by say three. That would be your [snorts] baseline. That would be $6,000. You want to be a bit more on the safe side here. Then that becomes $12,000. And that is your emergency money. You're going to open a high yield savings account and you're going to send money into that. Right now, you can do that in increments, $100 a month or $50 a week or whatever, and it's going to go from your checking account to your emergency fund every month. Make that an automation so it's done and you forget about it, right? Most banks will literally allow you to set up a automated transfer with even like I want to do this 50 times and then it stops and then you've got your number and you're done. This is building your safety net. We then confront the financial bully. has been following you around. I'm Felix Pin. I'm an ex-investment banker. I've seen how the financial world really works on the inside. I've got Winston back there, chief research hound. That's where all the thinking happens. And I'm also the founder of the Goat Academy where we've taught over 20,000 students so far and the co-founder of tradevision.io where I make news and data available to you. That is usually the purview of the Wall Street lot. And our mission here is very simple. teach regular people like you and me how to achieve financial independence using the same strategies that work on Wall Street. Who here has got debt on a credit card or a store card that you haven't fully paid off? That's you. Put a put a D in the in the comments and we'll get a bit of a poll going on there. [snorts] Getting rid of highinterest debt is the probably the most powerful thing you can do with your money. Let me show you a real example. Let's say you have $6,000 on a credit card. That $6,000 probably comes with a 25% interest rate if you're lucky. It could be a lot higher than that. So, the minimum payment each month is probably give or take $185 per month and you're just paying the minimum, right? Out of that $185, only 60 is actual down payments that reduces this balance. 125 is paying the interest, making that credit card company rich. If you keep paying the minimum, it would take you $25 years to pay off your debt, and you will pay $12,000 just in interest. So, you have taken your $6,000 into $6,000 plus $12,000 into $18,000. You're paying triple what you should, and it's going to slow you down. So, how do you change this? Well, [snorts] you got to start by listing all your debts, every card, how much you owe, the interest rates, their minimum monthly payments, and do it now. It's not fun, but now you got clout. Next, call your lenders. Ask them to reduce your interest rate. Yeah, they'll do that quite often, actually. Surprisingly often. Worst case, they say, \"No, I haven't lost a thing.\" Right? Keep paying the monthly minimum on all your cards and then use any extra money to pay off your highest interest debt first. That way, you're plugging the biggest hole in your boat. If your credit scores allows, you might also be able to move all of that debt into a lower interest or even zero interest for a period card. and then you can pay that off. But the danger with that is is that you've just got a new card and you're probably going to max it out, aren't you, with spending because that's how you got here. By the end of month two, you've tackled the urgent stuff, debt, spending, and your emergency fund. And even if it's going to take a while to fully fund them, you have a plan, and you know when it's going to be done. Now, things get more fun in month three. In month three, we create a simple automated system to build wealth. No stress, no complicated stuff, just a predictable growth path. I'm not a financial adviser. I'm not giving you financial advice. I'm just walking you through what is generally universally accepted as financial law. And the first law is index funds are friends. These are collections of hundreds of stocks that mirror the performance of the overall market. And historically for the last 100 years, the market has gone up. It goes up and down, but over time it has gone up and it's averaged depending on what time frame you look at somewhere between 7 and 12% per year. 7% after you take inflation out. So [snorts] pretty good stuff, right? Law two is time is your friend. The longer you are in the market, the better you'll do. Invest early, even with small amounts. Seriously, 20 bucks a month, 50 bucks a month, and your wealth will stack up dramatically thanks to time and a little thing called compound interest. Compound interest is interest you are earning on your money. And then that interest earns even more interest and it starts to snowball because it gets bigger every year. It's basically free money and it comes to you if you're patient and you keep investing. And understanding that compound interesting is so important. We actually did a whole video on it just before this one. So, so check that out. We'll try to link to it at the end. It drives me insane that so many people think investing is this super complicated thing they don't know how to do and they're worried about losing money. I'm telling you how it works right now. This channel is fact full of stuff that'll teach you exactly how. Now, the third law is tax efficient accounts must be maxed out. Can you please repeat that every morning as a mantra? Taxe efficient accounts must be maxed out. If your employer gives you a 401k match, put money into it up to the match because it's free money. And if you can contribute to a Roth IRA, let that money grow and it can be withdrawn tax-free when you retire. It's just like insane money. It just compounds twice as quick. Maybe you're eligible for one of those health savings accounts. You can use that as an investment account with a triple tax advantage, right? Don't worry about all the rich people's secret investments. They're mostly BS. You have access to amazing cheat codes the government gives you to incentivize you to hand more money over to Wall Street. Sorry, to make you financially free. Law four, fire your 1% financial advisor. If you have an adviser or you have a mutual fund that t takes 1% of you, get rid of the bugger. If you pay no fees and you have $100,000, that will grow to $761,000 in 30 years. If you're paying 1%, so this is no fees. Yeah. at 1% fees, same $100,000, same 30 years, you have $574,000. You see the massive whopping difference? You got more complicated financial situation. You want personalized help, that's okay. Use a financial advisor, but pay him by the hour. Pay him a flat fee. [snorts] Right? I've done that in the past. It was a conversation that was good. You're paying for advice. You're not paying a percent of your money because it's costing you hundreds of thousands of dollars. You want to make this an automation. You get your salary. It goes into your bank account, right? And you work out what percentage, what amount rather, what amount you want to invest. And then that amount will automatically buy some index fund, right? They're called ETFs as well, exchange traded index funds, right? So your money flows into the bank and then a smaller amount of that money buys an ETF. That happens automatically. So you will never ever forget about it. So you can figure that out. And you can make this more complicated. You can put a percentage, whatever that is. Maybe 5% goes into your 401k up to the employer match. Some of this might go into a Roth IRA. And very importantly, some of this also needs to pay off your credit card in full every month. I actually do it every week. It's one thing I do manually every week. Every single Sunday, I look at what what are all my credit card balances and I pay them off in full. Now, we get into the good stuff. We get into the really good stuff. We have month four ahead of us. It's time to take a serious look at you. Have a conversation with yourself about what is running your money brain. It's simple stuff like, \"I'm bad with maths.\" Money changes people. Yeah, money does change people. It makes makes you happier. It makes you more adventurous. It makes you more generous. So, what I want you to do is write down everything that comes to mind when you think about money. No filters, no judgments, all the negative stuff, right? And [snorts] then ask yourselves, are these beliefs helping you or they're holding you back? they're holding you back. I want you to make a decision that you're going to consciously change. Now, another thing people almost never do, talk to your partner about money. You only talk about money when it's a disaster, right? Talk about what your rich life, your beautiful life would look like. What would it mean to you? Find that out, right? You might be surprised. And then review some of the basics. Income, savings, the big expenses, and then do something little to celebrate. Little celebrations are wonderful. From all the people that we've teach how to invest better. The people who do it as couples massively outperform. Why? So, what do we do now? Well, we're in month five. We want to increase your freaking income because we're enough about, you know, the latte pinching Dave Ramsey stuff isn't all that much fun. We want to have more income. How do we do that? Ask for a bloody payriseise. When was the last time you asked for a payriseise? How do we do that? The first thing you got to do is you got to track where you are adding value. Something where you bid above and beyond where you hit your goals, where you saved the company some money. Go out, do some research, talk to the AIs and and ask them, \"This is my job. What's a what's a salary range?\" Right? So you before you had to go to all these websites, just just ask any of the AI bots out there and they'll do it for you. And if you just don't feel comfortable with negotiating, you're going to stay underpaid. And then what did we what do we do in month number six? This is the bonus. No extra homework in number six. See what I just did there? I made what seemed like a bigger task easier for you. So now it's just five steps. And if you implement these five steps, your life will be tremendously better down the road. You want to learn from my mentors?
