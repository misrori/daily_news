        "transcript": "Over the last few years, institutions have been buying up massive amounts of Bitcoin. This is bullish because institutions have some of the deepest pockets. And all of this money flooding into the crypto market can only be good for prices, right? Well, yes, but only until you consider just how much BTC institutions now control. While we've all been busy staring at the charts, institutional investors have been scooping up BTC by the bucketload. So much so, in fact, that they now control over 20% of BTC's total supply. This is starting to raise concerns among investors who are wondering what happens if these institutions stop buying and start selling. And not only that, but if this buying continues, could institutions eventually control Bitcoin? Today, we aim to find out. My name is Guy and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Before we begin though, you need to know that I'm not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. It's educational content intended to discuss Bitcoin's institutional adoption. If you enjoy content like this, then prove it by punching that like button and let's get going. Now, if you've been following crypto at all, you'll know that Bitcoin's institutional adoption has been nothing short of remarkable. Major banks now offer Bitcoin exposure. Asset managers have rolled out spot Bitcoin ETFs. Public companies are adding BTC to their balance sheets. And we've even seen countries like El Salvador adopt Bitcoin as legal tender. At first glance, this looks like a huge win for crypto. After all, institutions have brought legitimacy, liquidity, and attention to Bitcoin like never before. What was once dismissed as internet funny money is rapidly becoming one of the world's most important asset classes. But dig a little deeper and you'll hear a very different argument. Critics argue that Bitcoin's growing ties to Wall Street and Treadfi aren't a success. Instead, they see this wave of institutional adoption as a betrayal of Bitcoin's original purpose. A purpose laid out by its pseudonmous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto. As most of you will know, Bitcoin was born in the aftermath of the 2008 global financial crisis. Trust in banks was shattered. Governments were bailing out institutions previously deemed too big to fail, and ordinary people were left trapped in a collapsed system that had proved it wasn't fit for purpose. This systemic failure prompted Satoshi to publish the Bitcoin white paper in 2008, outlining their vision for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that would allow people to transact directly without relying on banks, governments, or indeed any other intermediaries. At its core, Bitcoin was designed to operate independently of Tradfi. That means no central authority, no behind closed doors monetary policy, and no gatekeepers who can freeze accounts, censor transactions, or devalue the currency through endless printing. Instead, it offered a fixed supply, transparent rules, and a decentralized network secured by miners spread out across the globe. Fast forward to today, though, and the picture looks very different. Bitcoin is no longer independent of Travi. It's increasingly being integrated with the very system it was meant to disrupt. Institutions now hold vast amounts of BTC while regulated futures markets play a huge role in influencing BTC's price. Even spot Bitcoin ETFs, bullish as they are, let investors use traditional brokerages to buy shares in a financial vehicle that only provides indirect exposure to BTC. In other words, Bitcoin is now being wrapped, packaged, and distributed using Tradfi Rails. Now, for some Bitcoin holders, this is deeply unsettling. Many argue that institutional adoption undermines Bitcoin's core ethos of self-custody and decentralization. After all, if millions are now accessing BTC through ETFs, trusts, or custodians, are we really reducing the reliance on intermediaries? Meanwhile, beyond the philosophical concerns, there's also lots of debate around Bitcoin's decentralization. Obviously, major institutions have far more capital than the rest of us, enabling them to accumulate ungodly amounts of BTC. And as some of the biggest Bitcoin whales out there, institutions can lobby regulators in ways ordinary plebs like you and me simply can't. And with great power comes great potential to reshape financial markets or you know whatever it was Uncle Ben said. But here's the problem. Bitcoin's future growth now depends on continued institutional adoption. While it can function perfectly well as a decentralized network without any institutional involvement whatsoever, it can only grow so far relying on enthusiasts alone. Its liquidity and global relevance now hinge on institutions bringing capital at a scale retail investors simply can't match. On top of that, institutions bring the infrastructure, compliance frameworks, and frankly the credibility needed to attract future investors and enthusiasts. But more importantly, they provide the rails for Bitcoin to integrate into the wider economy. They provide deep liquid markets while legitimizing Bitcoin as a store of value. Without this, Bitcoin might still be dismissed as internet funny money, something nerds obsess over or criminals rely on, or well, both. And that tension between independence and integration could very well be what defines Bitcoin's future in the coming years.

When you break it down by numbers, the result is truly mindblowing. Publicly listed companies have been some of the earliest and largest buyers. Collectively, they hold over 1.1 million BTC with around 62% of that held by just one company alone. Yep, you guessed it, Strategy, formerly Micro Strategy. But it's not just public companies making waves. Bitcoin ETFs and exchanges actually hold the largest share of BTC at over 1.6 million coins in total. The largest player by far is Black Rockck's EyesShares Bitcoin Trust, which alone holds roughly 780,000 BTC, nearly half of all institutional ETF holdings. Other major players include Fidelity's Bitcoin Fund with over 200,000 BTC and Gayscalees Bitcoin Trust with 167,000 BTC. These products have played a huge role in helping Bitcoin to merge with the legacy financial system. Governments, meanwhile, are also big holders of Bitcoin. Collectively, nationstate entities control around 646,000 BTC. The US alone accounts for roughly 328,000 BTC, followed by China with 190,000 BTC and the UK with around 61,000 BTC. Now, of course, most of this came from seizing Bitcoin from criminals. Elsewhere, private companies and DeFi entities have also accumulated boatloads of Bitcoin. Private firms collectively hold over 288,000 BTC with Block.1 topping the list at 164,000 BTC, followed by USDT issuer Tether with 96,000 BTC. DeFi protocols and similar organizations hold roughly 372,000 BTC, much of which is locked up to back wrapped or derivative versions of Bitcoin. In total, this means that institutions now hold well over 4 million BTC. As mentioned in the introduction, that's about 20% of the entire Bitcoin supply. And what's crazy is that this Bitcoin has been accumulated far faster than many analysts predicted. Case in point, back in May last year, Bitwise projected that institutional ownership would reach 20% only by the end of 2026. And yet here we are barely into the year and that threshold has already been crossed. So what does this mean going forward? Well, if the current pace continues, institutions could end up controlling far more than 20% of BTC's total supply in the next few years. This could be likely if crypto enters a bare market simply because BTC will be cheaper to accumulate. But obviously, that assumes they don't dump everything first in order to push prices even lower. This brings us to the pressing question of how much BTC is being sold by institutions and why. In case you missed the memo, there have in fact been some big sales lately. For example, Riot Platforms, a Bitcoin mining firm, sold over 1,800 BTC in December, according to the company's press release. This came after BTC fell roughly 20% over the previous two months, suggesting that Riot was either de-risking or planning one hell of a Christmas party. But the biggest source of institutional selling over the past few months has been from spot Bitcoin ETFs. Since their launch in January 2024, spot Bitcoin ETFs have become one of the biggest drivers of BTC's price action, both on the way up and on the way down. When ETF inflows are strong, BTC rallies. When outflows are strong, BTC crashes. Following October's massive liquidation event that saw almost $20 billion wiped from the crypto market, spot Bitcoin ETF investors rushed to derisk. In November, spot Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows of over $3.4 billion, marking one of the biggest months for outflows on record. Outflows then slowed to around $1 billion in December, but the ETF still accounted for more selling than any other institutional group with over $800 million sold in the first 5 days of December. In January, ETF outflows picked up again with another $1.6 billion of BTC sold and nearly half sold in the first week. Unsurprisingly, this hasn't helped BTC's price over the past few months. Now, we should reiterate that institutions aren't abandoning Bitcoin. Quite the opposite. In fact, a recent report by Coinbase and Glass Node revealed that 71% of institutional investors believe BTC is undervalued. In other words, they want to hold more BTC, not less. And you can learn more about that report by checking out the video we did on it right over here. Still, this begs the question of whether there could be additional selling in the future and what could trigger it. Well, perhaps the biggest risk is a regulatory shock. You see, the reasons why institutions are still so bullish is because of how the regulatory environment has improved so dramatically in recent years. However, if that progress were reversed, be that through unclear rules, hostile legislation, or sudden enforcement actions, institutions wouldn't hesitate to reduce their exposure. Unlike retail investors, they don't huddle through uncertainty. Another possible risk is a macro shock, like a recession, economic stress, or rising geopolitical tensions. Events like these can force institutions to liquidate assets regardless of their long-term beliefs. In these scenarios, Bitcoin would be treated merely as a liquid asset with institutions acting quickly to preserve that liquidity. And I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the concerns around quantum computing, which are growing by the day. If you've been keeping up with the channel, you'll know that quantum technology has the potential to be able to crack the encryption on Bitcoin wallets, which could result in billions in BTC being stolen and sold. Now, while many see this threat as being years away, others aren't so sure, and institutions are inherently forward-looking. To be frank, this threat is something the crypto industry needs to deal with urgently. Without a proactive approach, institutions could walk away from Bitcoin entirely, which would have serious implications for BTC's price. Case in point, Charles Edwards, the founder of digital asset firm Capriole, said that BTC could fall below $50,000 if Bitcoin developers don't get serious about the quantum threat. In his words, quote, \"We have to fix this next year or bonvoyage. enjoy the biggest Bitcoin bare market in history. FTX will look like a cakewalk. Yikes. Now, by this point, you may be wondering if the institutional adoption of Bitcoin could actually present risks to the network's security, especially since institutions now control 20% of BTC's supply and counting. Like we mentioned earlier, well, you'll be pleased to know that even with this mass accumulation of BTC, there is no real direct threat to the Bitcoin protocol itself. That's because Bitcoin security is protected by its decentralized proofof work consensus. Even with huge amounts of BTC, this doesn't change how the network is secured. All these institutions would need to start mining Bitcoin for there to be a real risk. That said, there are some security concerns that we shouldn't overlook, even if they're more indirect. Put simply, institutional stakes in Bitcoin miners could concentrate the network's hash power, that is, computational power, running the network. This raises the risk of a 51% attack, where at least half of all miners on the network collude to overpower the other 49%, effectively taking full control of the blockchain. In practice though, executing a 51% attack would be astronomically difficult and expensive. An attacker would need more computing power than all honest miners combined along with an ungodly number of specialized machines running nonstop. Add the enormous energy costs and even the largest institutions would struggle to pull it off. In other words, a 51% attack is extremely unlikely, if not outright impossible. But even if this mass accumulation doesn't present a threat to the Bitcoin network itself, there's a clear risk to price because of ownership concentration in BTC's supply. These institutions would only need to sell a fraction of their supply to tank BTC's price. Recall that institutions collectively hold 4 million BTC. If they decided to sell, say, 30% of their holdings due to some kind of shock, then this would result in roughly 1.2 million BTC flooding the market. For perspective, this is more BTC than the holdings of every Bitcoin treasury company combined. There's also custodial risks to consider. When institutions buy BTC, they don't typically use self-custody wallets. They outsource this responsibility by relying on custodial services. The problem is this presents another centralization risk since it makes these custodians a potential single point of failure. This exposes the BTC they hold to numerous risks including hacks, fraudulent activity, and even the insolveny of the custodian themselves. And this isn't just hypothetical. It's happened before. In June 2023, crypto custodian Prime Trust was placed into receiverhip after it was discovered to only have a fraction of the funds needed to honor client withdrawals. Allegedly. Another example is BitGo, a prominent institutional crypto custodian which was found to have a wallet vulnerability in March 2023. Again, allegedly. Thankfully, no funds were lost and BitGo worked fast to quickly patch the issue. Even so, this example highlights how even institutional-grade security solutions can have flaws that if left unchecked could lead to billions of dollars worth of BTC being stolen. So, while institutions don't threaten the protocol itself, they do introduce financial and systemic risks that we should be aware of. That said, institutions are unlikely to break Bitcoin even if their involvement does change the ecosystem. So then, what does all of this mean for BTC's price? Well, let's start with the obvious. As institutions continue to throw their massive amounts of capital into Bitcoin, this will continue to push BTC's price up and to the right in the long term. The catch is that as institutions buy and hodddle more BTC, this means there's far less liquid supply to actively trade. So even with Bitcoin's market cap in the trillions of dollars, this could actually increase Bitcoin's price volatility rather than decrease it. That's simply because the remaining liquid supply would be more sensitive to price fluctuations. Now, of course, the flip side to this is that as institutions continue to quietly accumulate billions of dollars worth of BTC in the background, this will result in a passive bid that provides stronger support for its price. In other words, this constant flow of capital could actually make BTC less volatile in the long run. In fact, if institutions continue to make BTC a key part of their investment portfolios, they could end up accumulating even more in the bare market at a steep discount. Recall that 71% of institutions already think BTC is undervalued. To these guys, any downside price action is just an opportunity to further accumulate. And there's also a powerful signaling effect at play. When institutions hold Bitcoin through the rough patches, it sends a clear message that this asset isn't going away. That kind of conviction is hard for even the biggest skeptics to ignore, and it lends credibility not just to Bitcoin, but to the broader crypto ecosystem as well. Naturally, this will attract many new investors to Bitcoin, both retail and institutional. Even so, there are very real risks, and we suspect that quantum resistance will become a major focus area for developers. But if this risk is addressed, then any concerns about Bitcoin's longevity will be a thing of the past. So, while it may be right to have some concerns about Bitcoin's new direction, it's clear that institutions are increasingly adopting it. So, the question then becomes, will this adoption come at a greater cost? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. All right, folks, that's about all from me for today.
