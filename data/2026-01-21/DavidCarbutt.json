        "transcript": "Nvidia's CEO Jensen Wang just spoke at the World Economic Forum in Davos and he was on top form. I've pulled out my three favorite clips from his interview. The last one specifically is a banger. But firstly, a bonus intro which did make me laugh. It is my real pleasure to introduce Jensen Wong, who is somebody I admire, somebody I've watched, and somebody who has been a teacher to me on the journey of learning about technology and AI. It is amazing watching how he led Nvidia. And um I don't measure myself on on comparisons, but I like this one comparison. So since Dvidia has been public, which was in 1999, same year as Black Rockck, oh boy. Okay. No, Nvidia's total return for its shareholders has been a compounded 30 37%. Just think about that. What would that mean to every pension fund if they invested in Nvidia as an IPO? The the amount of successes we have with everybody's retirement. At the same time, uh Black Rockck's annual wise uh total return has been 21%. not so bad for a a financial services company but uh uh it certainly pales and uh and so that but that is just a really great indication of Jensen's leadership the positioning of Nvidia and also it is a great statement about what in the world believes in the future of Nvidia so Jensen congratulations on that journey and I know we have many more years of that journey ahead of us. Thank you. I appreciate that. My only regret was at the IPO, after the IPO, I wanted to buy my parents something nice and so I sold Nvidia stock at a valuation of $300 million. Uh, the company was at a valuation of $300 million and I bought them a Mercedes S-Class. It It is the most expensive car in the world. Okay, so in my third favorite clip, which we're about to watch right now, Jensen breaks down AI into five layers: energy, chips, cloud, models, and applications, and explains why we're only a few hundred billion into what's going to be a multi-trillion dollar buildout. Check it out. >> Now, the important thing about this is that because we're reinventing that entire computing stack, the question is, what is AI? You're asked when you think about AI, you think about the AI models, but it's really important to understand industrially AI is actually essentially a five layer cake. At the bottom is energy. AI because it's processed in real time and it generates intelligence in real time. It needs energy to do so. Energy is the first layer. The second layer is the layer that I live in. It's chips. Chips and computing infrastructure. The next layer above it is the cloud infrastructure, the cloud, the cloud services. The layer above that is the AI models. This is where most people think AI is. But don't forget that in order for those models to happen, you have to have all of the layers underneath it. But the most important layer and this is the layer that's happening right now. The reason why last year was an incredible year frankly for AI is that the AI models made so much progress that the layer above it which is ultimately the the layer that we all need to ex to succeed the application layer above that. And so this application layer could be in financial services, it could be in healthcare, it could be in manufacturing. This layer on top ultimately is where economic benefit will happen. But the important thing though because this computing platform requires all of the layers underneath it. It has started and you guys are everybody's seeing it right now. It has started the largest infrastructure buildout in human history. [clears throat] We're now a few hundred billion dollars into it. So we're a few hundred billion dollars into it. Uh Larry and I, we get the opportunity to work on many projects together. There are trillions of dollars of infrastructure that needs to be built out. And it's sensible. It's sensible because all of these contexts have to be processed so that the AI so that the models can generate the intelligence necessary to power the applications that ultimately sit on top. And so when you go back and when you reason about it layer by layer by layer and you you realize that the energy sector is now seeing extraordinary growth. The chip sector TSMC just announced they're going to manufact they're going to build 20 new chip plants. Foxcon working with us and Wistron and Quanta building 30 new computer plants which then go into these AI factories. So we have chip factories, computer factories and AI factories all being built around the world. >> And memory and memory, right? Exactly. Those chip fabs. Uh Micron has started investing $200 billion in the United States. SKH Highix is doing incredibly. Samsung is doing incredibly. You could see that entire chip layer growing incredibly today. And now of course we pay a lot of attention to the model layer but it's really exciting that the layer above them is really doing fantastically. And now one indicator is where are the VC funding going into last year 2025 was one of the largest years in VC funding ever and last year most of the funding went to what is called AI [clears throat] native companies. These are companies in healthcare, the company in robotics, incoming manufacturing, financial services, all of the large industries in the world. You're seeing huge investments going in to those AI natives because for the first time, the models are good enough to build on top of. >> AI is creating an entirely new industrial economy with five independent layers, and we're watching it get built in real time. Jensen's framing here is really useful because most people think of AI as chat bots or whatever model they're using, but that's like thinking the internet is just websites. The model is one layer. Underneath it, you've got energy, chips, cloud infrastructure, and above it, you've got the applications that actually touch people's lives. Each layer depends on the ones below it. You can't have great AI applications without great models. Can't have great models without cloud infrastructure. Can't have cloud infrastructure without chips. and can't have chips without, you guessed it, energy. It's a stack and every layer has to scale together. As Jensen says, TSMC is building 20 new chip plants. Foxcon, Wistron, and Quant are building 30 new computer factories. Micron's investing $200 billion in the US alone, and Jensen saying we're only a few hundred billion into what needs to be trillions. The investment so far, which already feels massive, is basically the down payment. The real buildout, according to Jensen, hasn't even started yet. And this explains why you're seeing so much activity across seemingly unrelated industries. Energy companies are suddenly relevant to AI. Memory manufacturers are seeing demand they never expected. Construction firms are building these massive data centers. We built out electricity grids. We built out telecom networks. We built out the internet. This is the next one, and it touches all of those. The thing that stood out to me is his point about the application layer finally taking off. 2025 saw record VC funding and most of it went to what Jensen calls AI native companies. Healthcare, robotics, manufacturing, financial services. These aren't AI research labs. They're companies using AI to solve real problems in traditional industries. That's the signal that we've crossed some threshold. The models got good, good enough that you can actually build businesses on top of them. And once that happens, the demand for everything underneath, the chips, the energy, the infrastructure just compounds. So that's the infrastructure picture. But the question everyone keeps asking is, what does that mean for jobs? Jensen addresses this head-on using radiology as a case study. 10 years ago, everyone said radiologists would be the first to go. AI could read scans better than humans. Here's what actually happened and why the framework he gives for thinking about any job is worth paying attention to. Quick plug before I play that clip. I built the AI course I wish I had and read before I started deep diving into AI. I break down everything from chips to foundation models to research labs to ontologies to some of the leading companies in physical AI and why it's such a big market. If you join today, you get lifetime access and the price will be increasing every time we add new modules, which we're thinking of doing soon. So, if you want to get in at the cheapest price, now is the best time to do that. Um the second thing to realize and and so we theorize about um the automation of of uh of tasks and things like that and what is the implication to jobs. Um you know I'll I'll just offer some anecdotes. These are real world anecdotes of what has actually happened. Remember 10 years ago I one of the first first professions that everybody thought was going to get wiped out was radiology. And the reason for that was the first AI that became superhuman in capability was computer vision. And the one of the largest applications of computer v vision is studying scans by radiologists. Well, 10 years later, it is true that AI has now completely permeated and diffused into every aspect of radiology. And [clears throat] it is true that radiologists um use uh AI to study scans. Now it the impact is 100% and the impact is completely real. However, not surprisingly I say not surprisingly if you reason from first principles not surprisingly the number of radiologists have gone up. Is that because a lack of trust of or is that because the human interaction with the with the results of AI is a better outcome? >> Exactly. The reason for that is because a radiologist their job the purpose of their job >> is to diagnose disease to help patients diagnose disease. That's the purpose of their job. The task of the job includes studying scans. The fact that they're able to study scans now infinitely fast allows them to spend more time with patients diagnosing their disease, interacting with the patients, interacting with other clinicians. Well, surprisingly, also not surprisingly, actually, as a result of that, the number of patients that the hospital can see has gone up because, you know, there a lot of people waiting a long time to get to get their scans done. And so now because the the number of patients have gone up, the revenues of the hospital has gone up, they hire more radiologists. This is the same thing is happening to nurses. We're 5 million nurses short in the United States um as a result of using AI to do the [clears throat] charting and the transcription of of uh the the uh the patient visits. uh nurses spend half of their time charting and now they could use AI technology in one particular company a bridge their a partner of ours doing incredible work as a result of that the nurses could spend more time visiting patients but touch that's right and because you can now see more patients and we're no longer bottle less bottlenecked by the number of nurses more patients could get into the hospital sooner as a result hospitals do better they hire more nurses And so surprisingly AI is increasing their not surprisingly AI is increasing their productivity. As a result the hospitals are doing better. They want to hire more people. You have too many people waiting too long to get into hospitals. And so these are two perfect examples. Now the easiest way to think about whether what is the impact of AI on a particular job is to understand whether the job what is the purpose of the job and what is the task of the job. My if you if you just put a camera on the two of us and just watched us, you would probably think the two of us are typists because I spend all of my time typing and and so if AI could automate so many so much word prediction and help us type then we would be out of jobs but obviously that's not our purpose and so the question is what is the purpose of your job in the case of radiologists and nurses is to care for people and that that purpose is enhance hands that made more productive because the task has been ma has automated and so to the extent that you can reason about each one of the people's purpose versus the task I think it's a helpful framework AI automates tasks not purposes and that distinction explains why radiologist jobs increased instead of disappearing radiology was supposed to be ground zero computer vision got superhuman at reading scans the technology completely penetrated the field and Jensen says it's been a 100% adoption and yet 10 Years later, there are more radiologists than ever before. Not fewer, more. The opposite of what everyone predicted. And it's worth understanding why. A radiologist's purpose is to diagnose disease and help patients. The task includes studying scans. AI made the task infinitely faster, which meant radiologists can now spend more time on the actual purpose, talking to patients, consulting with other doctors, making better diagnosises. The hospital can see more patients because they're no longer bottlenecked by scan reading time. Revenue goes up. They hire more radiologists. I think the key insight here is that most jobs exist because there's more demand than supply. There are always more patients who need care than there are people to care for them. There are always going to be more problems to solve than people solving them. When you make workers more productive, you start chipping away at that backlog of unmet demand. The 5 million nurse shortage in the US doesn't go away because AI discharting. It gets a little smaller because each nurse can now handle more patients. The practical takeaway is to think about your own work this way. If you watch yourself on camera all day, what would it look like you're doing? That's the framework. Purpose versus task. If AI automates a task, it probably makes the purpose more achievable, not less relevant. Now for the bonus clip. If you've enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing. >> So, [clears throat] what I'm hearing is we're far from an AI bubble. The question is, are we investing enough? Let's turn the turn it around because there are so many people talking about a bubble, but the question is what I'm hearing from you is, you know, are we investing enough to do what we need to do to broaden the global economy. And so, one good test on the AI bubble is to recognize that Nvidia has now has now millions of NVIDIA GPUs in the cloud. We're in every cloud. Um, you know, we're used everywhere. And if you try to rent an Nvidia GPU these days, it's so incredibly hard. And the spot price of GPU rentals is going up. Not just the latest generation, but two generation old GPUs. The spot price of rentals are going up. And the reason for that is because the number of AI companies that are being created, the number of companies shifting their R&D budget. Lily is a great example. Uh three years ago, most of their R&D budget, all of their R&D budget was probably wet labs. um notice the big AI supercomputer that they've invested in the big AI lab increasingly that R&D budget is going to shift towards AI and so the AI bubble is is um uh comes about because the investments are large and the investments are large uh because we have to build the infrastructure necessary for all of the layers of AI above it and so I I think the um uh the opportunity is really quite extraordinary And everybody ought to get involved. Everybody ought to get engaged. Uh we need more energy. I think that we all recognize that. We need more land power in Shell. Um uh we need more uh trade skill workers. And in fact, that population of workforce is so strong here in Europe. >> Yes. >> In a lot of ways, the United States lost that um in the last, you know, 20, 30 years. Um but is still incredibly strong here in Europe. It's it's an extraordinary opportunity you got to take advantage of. And so I I would you know in I know that where where Larry and I work uh we uh we see the the investment opportunities um and the investment uh scale is going up. uh the number of startups as I mentioned earlier that LA 2025 the largest investment year in VC history over a hundred billion dollars around the world most of it was AI natives and so these AI companies are building basically the application layer above they're going to um you know and go build this future >> and I actually believe it's going to be a great investment for pension funds around the world to to be a part that to grow with this AI world. And this is one of my messages as so many political leaders. We need to make sure that the average pensioner, the average saver is is a part of that growth. If they're just watching it from the sidelines, you know, they're they're going to feel left out. And we want to invest in infrastructure, >> right? In infrastructure is a great investment option. This is the single >> largest infrastructure buildout in human history. Get involved. Most people pour money into ads people ignore. YouTube changes that. It builds trust, authority, and a real connection at scale. One law firm we worked with landed 33 clients in just 5 months worth $330,000 from their YouTube channel. If you run a business, this is one of the most overlooked opportunities right now. Book a call with me below and I can show you how we can make it"
