        "transcript": "So, the last two days were not easy. I get it. Everything that has to do with software, with tech, with AI, everything is selling off and it's terrifying. It's unnerving and it's scary. 48 hours of total carnage in the market right now. But I'm here to set the record straight to tell you exactly what's going on, why this is happening, what's the next steps, how to contain the situation, how to manage your portfolio, and basically all the answers you're not getting on the so-called experts on social media. Most of them don't have the slightest idea what the f they're talking about and certainly not mainstream media which is flooded with people who are purely just regurgitating their own opinions with zero value for you as a long-term investor in this extremely volatile market. So the first answer we have to provide for you which I feel is lacking right now watching the last few days is why the sell-off is happening to begin with because I think there's a lot of misunderstanding here and like a lot of things in life it's not one particular thing usually when you have a perfect storm like this it's a combination of multitude kfles coming together to this beautiful soup of that we're seeing over the past few days now in our case we're talking about a mixture of three elements. On the one hand, we have a new AI scare. Now, if you recall, not that long ago, we had a deepseek scare. Remember deepseek from China? It was supposed to reflect the new AI wave to replace chat GPT and revolutionize AI and everything sold off. Well, now we have a second coming of that. And this time, the root cause is not some Chinese large language model. It's anthropic. essentially anthropic coming out with a bunch of new AI tools which now seem to have convinced the entire world that they're about to kill every single software company in the world. Kill every single job in the world that has to do with tech or software or AI. Everybody from now on are going to be working at an amusement park or flipping burgers at Mickey De's or whatever that means. But essentially everything that has to do with services, with software, with AI, everything is being sold off because Enthropic essentially convince the world that AI in 6 to 12 months will replace everybody. Okay, so that's number one. Number two, there's a lot of profit taking and with profit taking there's some sort of a snowball effect like there always because when people have been winning for three years and there been a lot of unrealized profits at the first sign of a little bit of turbulence at this first sign of a little bit of trouble, there's going to be some profit taking as you would expect. But the thing is the more it happens, the more profit taking becomes this snowball effect. it brings down the prices and then more people are jumping in and then more people jumping etc etc and that keeps on happening until the price comes down to that level where it's just hard to ignore and the buyers jump back in. On top of it, you can't ignore the fact that there's a lot of uncertainty with the macro, with the US dollar, with everything that Trump is doing. It's very hard to gauge what the policy is going to look like for the next six to 12 months because everything is just flip-flopping every second day with tariffs, with the US dollar, with the whole stuff that's going on. And the one thing that markets absolutely hate is uncertainty. And the one thing they hate even more is uncertainty in macroeconomics. So this combination is leading to this couple days of sale. Now, this couple days of sale can easily be over tomorrow or it can continue for another two or three weeks. Nobody knows. And I would highly advise against trying to figure out when this is going to end. Maybe one more day, maybe one more hour, maybe even three more weeks. Markets can stay irrational and crazy a lot longer than anyone can stay solvent. So, the first thing is to relinquish the idea that you can somehow guess where the bottom is. Now, you can guess where the bottom is and hit it right here and there, but you might get that at the casino with a crab shoot or with a roulette table, but you can't consistently do it. Now, every time this happens, you know, I like a game where the odds are stacked my favor. I like to beat the house. So, every time a drop is happens, you know, I can try and guess where the bottom is going to be, but probably eight out of 10 times I'm not going to hit it. you know, two out of 10 times you're going to end up looking good, but if I'm going to do it again and again and again, eventually I'm going to get burnt out and I'm going to blow up my account. So, I have developed my own thesis how to handle days like this and weeks like this. And it's a very straightforward framework and I'm going to share it with you right here because I can really summarize it in just three easy steps. Okay. Whenever I see a drop in the prices, a sell-off, especially a broad market sell-off or a category off sell off like we have right now in tech and software and AI, what I usually do is I develop this framework. So if a drop happens, it triggers a check for me. Now the check is essentially fundamental check. I'm not looking at the price, but I'm saying okay, so the stock is selling off like crazy. Okay, so we have to verify whether this selloff has to do with the company itself, whether something happened fundamentally. Maybe we had some departures from key figures. Maybe they lost a big client. Maybe they got disrupted. Maybe this changes everything about the stock. But we have to check whether this decline has anything to do with the fundamentals. And if the answer is yes and our thesis no longer holds, well, my conclusion is to sell. Obviously, if the product ain't good anymore, no point in holding on hoping that somebody will buy it off me and I'll, you know, break even. But if at the end of my examination, the result is that the thesis is not changed and it remains solid, well, the only conclusion is buy more because think about it this way. If you saw an electronic device at the store and the cost was, you know, $300 a day earlier, now you come into the store a day later and now this same device is selling at a 20, 25, 30% discount for no reason. None. Same device, same features. There's nothing except the fact that there is a sale. Well, you'd be excited for that. But somehow in the stock market, it doesn't work like that. The logic is backwards. Whenever we have a sale on good companies, it tends to spook people instead of get them excited. So, my whole thing is let's stump the emotions. Let's be critical. Let's be analytical. Let's check whether this price drop has anything to do with fundamentals. And if it does, sell. If it doesn't, buy. But that's just the tip of the iceberg. That's the beginning of the framework and I want to walk you through it. But for that I have to show you the next phase. Now the next phase is very simple. Look right now. Okay. We can take a look at the S&P 500 on a 10year zoom out and it's going to look like a straight line like this beautiful green straight line and it's going to be very simple to understand, very simple to see and actually see that 10% average playing out long term. And it's very easy for humans to think in straight lines. It's very hard for humans to understand exponentiality and randomness and uncertainty. And this is a prime example because even though the S&P 500 will give us 10% per year on average, the thing is we almost never have 10% years in reality. And even though it sounds weird, the thing is that that average is usually a result of very wide fluctuations. Sometimes we'll get a year that is + 30, sometimes a year that's minus 20, sometimes a year that's plus 40, then minus 8, etc., etc., etc. That 10% average, you know, from the market, it comes from a lot of volatility in the the in between, in the middle parts. So people are expecting this, but because we're humans, we expect this 10% just to be linear and beautiful and steady in a flat surface just at the right temperature. It's not going to happen like this. The stock market is a very volatile environment. It's a jungle of chaos. And that 10% is going to come from a lot of volatility. And if you zoom in into these volatility cycles, they're going to look very scary. Actually, the past few days are not even that. They're not even that scary. They're pretty much par for the course. The stock market drops 5% three times per year. 5% the S&P I mean 10% at least once per year. Every couple years we have a bare market of 20%. None of this is strange or an outlier. It's pretty pretty much part for the course. It's normal. And if you get comfortable with this and you understand that sometimes you're going to experience these things, these drops and sometimes you're going to experience these things which are the crazy bull runs, but at the end of the day, you're going to ride the average. You have laid the foundation to a very successful career as a long-term investor. The worst thing you could do is to hyperfocus on the hype cycles and to over buy or to panic sell during, you know, days like for the past two days what we've seen. Piloter is a prime example of that and I would even say a very extreme example of that. Now, a lot of people comment on my videos over the past 48 hours quoting the price back to me over the past two days. Tom, the stock is down today 10%. The stock is down today 20%. The stock is down yesterday, today 25%. And they keep quoting this daily price movements. And I find it a little bit amusing because if you look at Palanteer's history, it's pretty much been a very volatile stock. The history is pretty staggering since it went public in 2020. The stock dropped 20% 10 times in 5 years. So it drops 20% what you've seen over the past two days that happens twice a year on average since it went public. It's not a an unusual occurrence. In fact, just 12 months ago, in February of 2025, the stock literally dropped 50% in just two or three weeks. In fact, in 2022, the stock dropped 83%. None of this is scary for us. You don't know where we've been. You want to scare us with a couple of days of drops. This is what we went through with the stock. It's a very volatile stock. And there's benefits to that volatility. for example, it's going to give you a,000% in a 3-year period where the S&P does 100%. Because it's way more volatile. But in bad days where everybody gets wet, well, Palanteer is going to be at the very wet end of this. By the way, during this entire cycle, 10 drops of 20, one drop of 50, one drop of 83, all that in five years, the stock has done 2,200% since 2023 in just the past two and a half, three years. So the lesson here is very very simple. If you picked a good company or alternatively you invested in a broad market index like the S&P 500, well you're going to be fine as long as you can weather the volatility. Of course, weathering a volatility of a horrible stock not going to help you. But again, assuming you've p a good business with good fundamentals or you just bought the stack and just bought the SP funed, the volatility is just a ticket. It's the price of admission. It's not something to get scared about. Now, what happens is usually in drops like this, and by the way, if the market continues to drop further, you'll see this happening at a greater extent, and I'm going to show you what's going to happen. What's going to happen is going to expose a lot of people. You know what Warren Buffett once said, when the tide comes out, you'll find out who's swimming naked. So, what's going to happen over the next few days, if this volatility continues, you'll see a lot more emotional reactions from people because people will get more scared, more anxious. Obviously, as this keeps happening and as you see more emotions and that's what's going to happen. You're going to have way more mistakes. Emotions are going to lead to mistakes. And that, my friends, is the key. I can't think of any single moment in time where I saw somebody make an emotional decision in the stock market and that emotional decision ended up being the right thing to do. In fact, if I think about it, every single emotional decision in the stock market I've ever seen led to a horrible result because emotions and investing are like water and oil. They don't really mix. You have to separate them, which is the whole foundation of my system, which I teach for my students, my academy, which is my double down system. Double down DCA system. I'll talk about in a second. In fact, I'll give it away in this video. What? By the way, I'll do something else for you. Just because you're here, I have a full panicree strategy guide on how to weather the past few days and how to do it the next time it happens. The whole guide, how not to panic, how not to get scared, how to weather the storm. This panic-free strategy guide is free for you to get right now. If you go to the description of this video and you look in the description box, the first link in the description box is going to be to download this guide. Go get it right now. Save it. Put it up on your wall. And every time you have a few red days, read it. It will give you my entire strategy from A to Z on how to weather the storm in days like this. But going back to my system now, the system is essentially the one you're going to read about in this guide. It's really built on one thing, which is averages. A weighted average that pushes the share price down as long as you continue to buy at all times. I'll show it in a second. But the one thing that this system does not have, none whatsoever, I promise you, is any sort of daily price action relevance. None of the things I teach which have made me a lot of money over the past few years and have helped a lot of students to change their lives through investing in stocks like Palanteer and Tesla and Nvidia and the overall market. None of this that we teach has anything to do with daily price action. Daily price action and good long-term strategies are two things that should never be mixed. You have to understand who you are. If you think that you are a long-term investor, that's fine. But if you're going to be asking day trader questions, essentially what happens, I'll give an example. You come in and you say, \"Well, Tom, the stock is down 15, 20, 25% over the past few days. What's going on?\" And you're a long-term investor, right? How does that question help you over the next five to 10 years in which you plan to be an investor of that company? It doesn't promote you at all. In fact, asking trader questions as an investor completely destroys your strategy. This is the equivalent of going to a baseball game with a sledgehammer instead of a bat. It's going to completely destroy the strategy for you. You have to understand what you are. If you're a trader, if you're a swing trader, if you're a day trader, certainly asking questions about daily price movements is super important to you. Super important. That's the whole stick. That's the whole thing. But as a long-term 5, 10 year investor, asking questions about daily price volatility, it's the wrong question. You have to understand who you are. You're a long-term investor. Focus on the fundamentals, focus on the business, not the daily price movement. It's not a good place to be in for investors. Now, of course, you might ask yourself this question. Say, \"Well, Tom, why can't we just, you know, put the cash on the sideline, sell everything today? Everything is selling off anyways, right? Let's just sell with everybody else, put the money on the sideline, and come back to the market when it eases up and everything gets better again.\" It's a good question. In theory, it sounds like a reasonable thing to do, but it's a really bad idea. And I'll tell you why. Most of the time, this is what's going to happen. Number one, there's this risk inversion with cash that people don't understand. Cash feels very very safe in the short term, which it is because it can drop 50% overnight like a stock, but over the long haul, inflation is essentially eating away that cash. And the more times go by, the more inflation is going to destroy that cash pile. So the same cash you held just 5 years ago is now literally worth 25% less. That's a fact. Now, if you continue to hold cash, inflation is going to keep eating at it. At eventually some point it's going to be almost worthless or at least worth half or a quarter what you used to hold. And the thing is risk changes with cash. In the beginning, risk is very small, but the more you hold on to cash, the bigger the risk becomes because of inflation. With stocks, it's literally vice versa, the opposite. In the beginning, in the short term, stocks feel very very unsafe, insecure. It feels like it can blow up at any moment. But then what ends up happening is that oh my god, 10% per year, 10% per year, 10% per year. And eventually what happens is that stocks become way safer in the long run compared to cash. There's an inversion of risk. Besides, why would you want to give up the best 10 days in the market if you're just sitting on the sideline? Think about it this way. You're sitting on the sideline and you miss the best 10 days of a 20-year period. And there's a specific reason I'm giving you this example. If you missed the best 10 days in the stock market over the past 20 years, you guys have slashed your returns in your portfolio by 50%. Just 10 days in 20 years will absolutely destroy your portfolio. What about being locked out? Let's say that you get out. When do you get back in? How do you know where it's the bottom? What if the stock market runs like crazy right now? Do you want to go back up? Should you wait for another dip? And then that dip never comes. What about giving up compounding interest? The 100 you have today makes 10 at the end of the year, then at day 11 at the next year, and so forth and so forth. Compounding is a massive, massive tool to create generational wealth. Why would you want to stop it and be on the sideline? Just look at what happened since 2020. People who've been through the craziness of the market, COVID and then then the bare market of 2022 and now and everything and the tariffs and deepseek people have made a lot of money by just staying in the S&P 500. It's not that complicated. Now look, if you look at the S&P 500, right? Over the past five years, we've gotten 80%. It's not bad. It's not bad. It's pretty spectacular, right? But if you look at the journey, the journey itself was very messy. Wasn't a straight line of 80%. So this is from 2020, 3,800, 4,700, then back down to 3,500 below this one. Then up to 4,500, down to 4,100, up to 6,000, February 2025, we dropped from 6 to 5,000 in just a matter of a few weeks right here. Now we're back up to 7,000. Maybe we drop again, maybe we don't. I don't know. But the journey is very very very messy. And if you hyperfocus on these declines, this is what you're going to miss out. The alternative cost of not being in the market for the past 5 years was 80%. Now, if you look at individual stocks, for example, a terrific stock like Nvidia, right? Nvidia is one of the best stocks in the market, hands down, right? Over the past 5 years, if you just set in Nvidia, you made,00% 1,200%. But look at the journey. went up from 14 to 32, then down to 12, from 32, up to 45, up to 90, then down to 76, big drop, up to 140, down to 94, massive drop, now back up to 173. So, at any point here, you could have sold off or not buy or get spooked, but if you just held on to 100%. And the same thing happened with Palunteer. Palanteer in 2020 came out at $10 a share right here. It then went up to $35. It then went back down to $6. Went up to 110, down to 75 in February last year. Now it's up to 186, now down to 156, up to 200, now down to 130. You can see the volatility here is crazy. But but bear with me here. If you bought Palunteer here or here or here or even here, you're still up a lot on your stock. The thing is volatility isn't necessarily a bad thing. If you can use it and you can harness it, you can actually make money off it. And I'll explain in a second how. Now, you can be a very very smart investor, not understand this concept, which is what I teach in the academy. My whole system is called the DCA doubled down system. It does not require us to predict anything. It only requires us to prepare. And here is the thing folks. If you buy good businesses or the S&P 500 condition number one, if you have self-control, if you monitor your positions throughout the year, this is the only thing you need to know. And I'm going to show it right now because I'm not about to put this behind a payw wall. I want you guys to learn and understand this. So if this is the journey that we've seen from stocks like Palanteer, like Nvidia, great stocks or the S&P 500, which is the broad market index, right? This pattern is going to repeat itself every time with a good stock or with the index. So in our system, basically what we're doing, we're creating a weighted average which is going to pull the share price down for us on a cost basis without timing the market even once. When the stock goes up and it's in this range right here, which is below the highest point it's been for the past year, that's called our 20% threshold. In the below threshold, where the stock is down relative to its highest point, we are performing a DCAX2, a double down DCA strategy. When the stock is in the orange area, which is where it's being hyped and bought and everybody's talking about it and it's very very close to the highs, not within this 20% range. We're performing a regular DCA, but we're buying at all times. We're buying at every single point here, but we're buying higher when it's down and we're buying a little bit less when it's up. And we continue to do this over years and years and years. Eventually, when you look back, anybody who's done the strategy is looking back five years saying, \"Oh my god, my cost basis in the stock is super close to the bottom. I haven't timed it even once.\" And I know what you're going to say. Well, Tom, how do we always have money to constantly DCA based on your system? We need constant cash flow. You can do this whether you're making 5 million a year or 50,000 a year. It doesn't matter how much money you make. If you do this correctly through starting from budgeting, then to allocation, then to creating a buffer, creating your bank, creating your deployment amount, and then knowing when to double down. No matter what your free cash flow looks like, at the end of the month, you can use the system if you understand the steps correctly. Save some money on the sideline when you're deploying. Deploy half and then deploy the rest through the DCA X2 process. It's that simple. That's not the hard part of the system. Unfortunately, the hard part is not mathematical is right here. It's psychological and it's emotional. Now, I just want to say right here, I don't like panic selling, but I don't like panic buying as well. If you're hanging out right now in the circles, I'm going to put it this way, that are talking about mortgaging their house and buying everything. Bad idea. DCA slow. Do not panic buy. You don't know where the bottom is of this market. This can continue for weeks. We are in the vertigo. We don't know we're the bottom or the top. We continue to DCA slowly. It's a marathon mentality. Slow DCA. Consistency wins. Want to take the next step? Want to learn with us? Check out what's going on in our group. Our Discord group of the past 48 hours, we've been running memes and jokes about this, buying, DCAing, joking about the Super Bowl. None of us is panicking. None of us freaking out because we have a system. We have a discipline. We know what the hell we're doing. Join us. patron.comdomnash. Get out of the right race. Join us. Peace."
