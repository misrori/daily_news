        "transcript": "Banks and crypto used to wage their regulatory battles behind closed doors. Well, not anymore. The fight is completely in the open now, and it's getting hairy. Previously, the battle was over whether crypto was legal. This time, it's about whether crypto can pay interest. And that's a fight banks absolutely cannot afford to lose. JP Morgan, the American Bankers Association, Coinbase, and Circle are at war over a technical loophole in the Genius Act, the law that was supposed to legitimize stable coins, but accidentally turned yield into a new battlefield. Banks say stable coin yield will drain trillions from the financial system. Crypto says banks should compete on price, not regulation. It's a trillion dollar fight over who gets to hold the American savings account in the 21st century. Banks have figured out that if they lose this battle, they don't just lose customers, they lose the ability to create money through fractional reserve lending. And they're not about to take that sitting down. My name is Louis and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Now, before we get into it, you need to know that nothing in this video is financial advice. This is just our take on the new regulatory showdown between banks and crypto and what it means for the financial system. If you find our videos useful, well, smash that like button and let's dig in. So, last summer, President Trump signed the Guiding and Establishing National Innovation for US Stable Coins Act. Quite the mouthful, but they got the acronym they wanted. The Genius Act, as so it's called, was supposed to end the regulatory chaos around stable coins. That should mean no more exchanges exiled offshore, no more questions about whether Circle was operating a shadow bank, and hopefully no more Terra implosions wiping out billions overnight. The law brought issuers like Circle and Paxos within the federal regulatory perimeter and with clear rules. The core stipulation is a 1:1 reserve requirement for dollar pegged stable coins. So, for every unit of USDC or other dollar stable coins in circulation, there must be a physical dollar or short-term Treasury bill 90 days or less held in a segregated account. Lending or reinvestment of this collateral is also forbidden. So, there should be no fractional reserve shenanigans. Unlike traditional banks, which can lend out 90% of deposits and only keep 10% on hand, stable coin issuers must maintain full liquidity at all times. This is a safety mechanism designed to prevent another terrorist style algorithmic collapse. To get the bill passed, the banking industry demanded a huge concession. The act explicitly prohibits stable coin issuers from paying interest directly to holders. This was specifically done to pigeonhold stable coins as payment instruments and stop them from doubling as investment products that could compete with savings accounts. The banks want stable coins to be dumb pipes for moving money. nothing more. However, it looks like they didn't think the language all the way through because there's a pretty glaring loophole in the Genius Act. The provisions about paying interest directly to holders are binding on stable coin issuers like Circle, Ripple, PayPal, and so on and so forth. But there is no explicit mention of stable coin distributors. There is nothing in the act to prohibit third party intermediaries from taking the revenue generated by those treasury reserves and passing it through to users. Now, who might those intermediaries be? Oh, well, I don't know, maybe crypto exchanges. You know, the places where most people actually get their stable coins. So, maybe issuers can't pay interest. But what if, say, Coinbase starts paying rewards or loyalty incentives funded by that same treasury interest? Well, apparently, it's that easy to thwart America's banking sector. Crypto exchanges spotted this workaround a mile off and started offering annual percentage yields on stable coin holdings of 4 to 5%. Banks called this a loophole. Crypto calls it innovation. Either way, it's now the core battleground in the war between tradfi and crypto. Banks got the regulatory framework they wanted. They just didn't get the outcome that they expected. Now, it's worth taking a moment to trace the money and see yield bearing stable coins work. Say you've got $100 and you want to park it somewhere safe. You open a crypto exchange. Let's use Coinbase as an example. And you buy $100 worth of USDC. And you just leave it there. The issuer of USDC, Circle, takes your $100 and buys Treasury bills yielding around 5%. That's the current risk-free rate the US government pays on short-term debt. Now, Circle doesn't just sit on that 5% yield. They've got revenue sharing agreements with the exchanges that list their stable coin. So, Circle pays Coinbase a marketing fee or distribution incentive, call it what you want, sourced from that treasury yield. Then, Coinbase turns around and passes roughly 4.5% of that through to you as rewards for holding USDC on their platform. To you, this looks and functions exactly like a high yield savings account. You see 4.5% APY acrewing daily. You can move the money instantly. It's got the liquidity of a checking account with a yield of a certificate of deposit. The only thing missing is FDIC insurance. But given that the reserves are supposed to be held one to one in treasuries, the risk profile is arguably better than a regional bank. Anyway, and here is where the semantic food fight begins. Banks look at this flow and call it regulatory arbitrage. They say it's interest by another name. A duck that quacks like interest, walks like interest, and pays like interest. The crypto industry insists these are activity-based rewards. They're compensating users for network participation for providing liquidity, for marketing loyalty. To the regulator trying to parse the law, it's a marketing incentive. To the user watching their balance grow, it's obviously interest. And if it's not clear yet why banks care so much about this, well, let's take a look at the competitive spread. Traditional US banks pay 0.01% on checking accounts. Some of the big ones are slightly more generous with a savings account, maybe, you know, 0.5% if you're lucky. Stable coins have been paying 4.5%. Banks can't compete on price because of their cost structures. branch networks scattered across the country, armies of compliance staff, deposit insurance premiums, legacy IT systems held together with duct tape and prayers. So instead of competing on price, they're lobbying to suppress the competition via regulation. Ban the yield. Banish stable coins back to the dumb payment rails from when once they came. But for Coinbase, this isn't some nice to have feature that they could just compromise away. With trading fees getting compressed by competition from other crypto exchanges and platforms like Robin Hood, the yield pass through model has become a critical source of revenue. Regulating it out of existence threatens the core economics of their platform model. That's why they suddenly walked away from the Clarity Act when they saw what was in it. The scale of what's at stake becomes clear when you run the numbers. Circle has approximately $70 billion in collateral backing USDC. At 5% yield, that generates $3.5 billion in annual revenue without taking any credit risk or making a single loan. And when you're printing billions from doing basically nothing, you're going to fight to keep that business model.

Now, I know what you're thinking. Oh no, won't somebody think of those poor banks profits? How will they cope now that their customers can earn more interest on their savings than the Cheeto dust does that they've been paying out? Trust me, I feel you. But it is worth listening to their argument because well, there are interesting macroeconomic implications here beyond their own margins. The banks have been making a case about the mechanics of credit creation and what happens to the financial system when deposits migrate from fractional reserve banks to fully reserved stable coins. The core concern is something called deposit substitution. Traditional banks rely on what you might call sleepy deposits. All those checking accounts paying 0.01% that customers leave sitting there out of inertia or convenience. Banks use these deposits as cheap funding to make mortgages, small business loans, and other forms of private credit. The spread between what they pay depositors and what they earn on loans is how they make money. If rational actors wake up and move those funds to stable coins paying higher yields, banks lose their cheap funding base. And when funding costs rise, lending capacity contracts. This phenomenon was modeled last year by the economist and Federal Reserve Board of Governors member Jesse Wang. In a research note titled banks in the age of stable coins, she shows a money multiplier effect working in reverse. For every dollar that leaves a bank deposit for a stable coin, bank lending drops by $126. In a high adoption scenario, Wang's model predicts the aggregate supply of credit in the US could decline by $600 billion to 1.26 trillion. Several research by economists Jeff Huther and Yikai Wang for the American Bankers Association puts numbers on the funding cost problem. If stable coin adoption hits two trillion, banks will need to replace cheap deposits with expensive wholesale funding, raising their cost of funds by 24 basis points. If stable coins can pay interest and adoption reaches $4 trillion, that jumps to 42 basis points. Jesse Wang's Fed research shows that banks will pass approximately 60% of these increased funding costs directly to borrowers through higher interest rates. This would hit mortgages and small business lending hardest. Firstly, because they're not able to bypass this by says issuing bonds like large corporations can, and also because theirs are the bank's least profitable loans, the loans that get cut first when funding gets expensive. All of this gets at the broader macroeconomic concept banks keep talking about the narrow bank problem. Stable coins function as narrow banks. They take deposits but hold 100% liquid assets in the form of treasuries instead of making loans. This removes capital from what economists call the money multiplier. When you deposit $100 in a traditional bank, that bank lends out $90, which gets deposited somewhere else, which gets lent out again, and so on and so forth. Your initial $100 creates several hundred of credit in the broader economy. But when you put a $100 into a stable coin, it sits in a treasury bill and goes nowhere. Money in a stable coin backs federal debt. Money in a community bank backs local businesses and by extension, local jobs. If everyone moves to stable coins, it's great for funding the US deficit, but terrible for getting a loan to build something productive. The Independent Community Bankers of America warns that $6.6 trillion in transaction deposits are at flight risk. The pitch is that every dollar that flows from a community bank to a stable coin is a mortgage that doesn't get written, a small business loan that doesn't happen, and so on and so forth. Is it bank propaganda? Well, absolutely. But is it true? Well, quite possibly. Mass adoption of stable coins as a savings vehicle could well sterilize capital from productive lending into sovereign debt financing, and that implies a structural shift where the US economy becomes dependent on federal borrowing rather than provide credit creation. The banks even have an intellectual sparring partner to point to, Paradigm, the crypto venture capital firm. They recently joined Coinbase and PayPal in funding research that claims stable coins are neutral for bank lending, meaning that they don't actually reduce credit supply. Paradigm hailed this finding in a blog post only to have the post savaged by the Bank Policy Institute on the grounds that the research was a misrepresentation of data that actually pointed to a much more negative conclusion. That study funded by Paradigm at all is based on earlier modeling that shows yieldbearing stable coins are neutral for bank lending so long as they exist only as a hypothetical competitive threat to banks and are not actually in circulation. In such a scenario, banks might see the thread on the horizon and get nervous about losing their customers. To prevent people from leaving, they might proactively raise their own deposit interest rates or increase their lending to capture more of the market while they still can. But the model shows that if yield bearing stable coins are actually launched, circulating and offering four to 5% rewards, rational customers withdraw their bank deposits and park the money in stable coins instead. Since those deposits are the bank's source of funding for loans in the fractional reserve model, their ability to lend is drained dollar for dollar. Or if you adopt Jesse Wang's model, dollar for $126. So, as the BPI points out, Paradigm is making a weird flex here because if you check out the data the research they funded is based on, it shows that the moment stable coins achieve real adoption, they suck liquidity out of the traditional system, increasing the bank's cost of funds and reducing the total supply of credit. And whether you think this is a legitimate concern or protectionist fear-mongering probably depends on whether you think fractional reserve banking is a critical economic infrastructure or a rentse seeeking arrangement that deserves to be disrupted. Okay, so the banks don't like yield on stable coins and they want us to be scared. They dunked on paradigm pretty hard, but fortunately for crypto, the industry has other stronger arguments in favor of yieldbearing stable coins. The core argument from Brian Armstrong and others at Coinbase is pretty straightforward. Banks have enjoyed a government-granted monopoly on lowrisk yield for decades. They take your deposits, earn 5% from the Federal Reserve on those same reserves, pay you back 0.5% if you're lucky, and they just pocket the spread. That's a structural advantage baked into the regulatory framework for an industry that has apparently had little incentive to innovate. Stable coins in cryptos telling simply close that gap by passing the treasury rate through to the end user. Armstrong's position is that the banks are the ones distorting the market and stable coins are actually correcting it. Circle for their part have framed this as a matter of dollar dominance. Their argument is essentially if the US bans stable coin yield the market doesn't disappear. It moves offshore. European platforms operating under MEA regulations can still offer yield. Tether, which is already the largest stable coin by market cap, operates outside US jurisdiction entirely. If American consumers can't earn treasury rates on their digital dollars domestically, they'll find a way to do it somewhere else. Circle's position is that this doesn't just hurt crypto. It actively undermines the dollar's position in the digital currency war by pushing demand away from US regulated products and towards less transparent alternatives. Interestingly, the crypto industry isn't entirely unified here. Tether CEO Paulo Ardoino has publicly stated that Tether doesn't have quote much beef in this fight because it doesn't share yield. The yield battle is primarily Coinbase's war because Coinbase is the one whose business model depends on passing Treasury yield through to US-based customers. For offshore issuers, a US yield ban is actually good news. It sends American consumers looking for alternatives. Then there's the technical argument about what yield actually is in crypto. The industry draws a sharp line between passive interest and rewards for services. When you stake assets on a proofofstake network, you're not just sitting on your hands. You're validating transactions, securing the network, and providing a technical service. Compensation for that work is categorically different from a bank paying you to leave money in a savings account. Crypto's position is that lumping all yields together as interest shows a fundamental misunderstanding of how these networks function and that regulating staking rewards out of existence would gut the DeFi ecosystem. The consumer argument is the simplest one and probably the most politically potent. Why should access to risk-free treasury rates be restricted to institutions and wealthy investors? Banks earn that rate on your money and they keep most of it. Stable coins pass it through. If someone wants to hold digital dollars and earn what the government actually pays on short-term debt, what market failure justifies stopping them? So, that's where both sides stand. banks warning about systemic credit contraction. Crypto arguing it's about efficiency and consumer choice. And right in the middle, Congress tries to settle it with the Clarity Act, which would have explicitly banned exchanges from paying yield solely for holding a stable coin. Coinbase, however, took one look at the tax and walked away, and the Senate Banking Committee canled the markup. The White House was reportedly furious. So the Genius Act solved the safety problem but created a competition problem. The Clarity Act then proved neither side is willing to blink. The question that remains is this. Does the US financial system stay bank ccentric where deposits fund private credit or does it shift toward a narrow bank stable coin model where digital dollars back sovereign debt and banks have to compete for customers like everyone else? We may get an answer this year and maybe sooner rather than later. So, make sure you're subscribed and keep your eyes peeled on this channel because we'll keep you updated every step of the way. That's it for me for now, though. As always, thank you so much for watching. This has been Lewis and I'll see you in the next video.",
