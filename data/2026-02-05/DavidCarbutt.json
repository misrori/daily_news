        "transcript": "Okay, let's get cracking. In clip one today, we're going to hear why investors are suddenly nervous about that open AI relationship with Microsoft and what it means for the whole AI infrastructure buildout. Then in clip two, we're looking at Tesla's decision to invest $2 billion into XAI and why this physical AI company thing is actually becoming the real story here. Finally, we're going to hear Elon Musk's shocking revelations on the last Tesla's earnings call. Let's dive in. I want to tackle the decline that we're watching in Microsoft shares right now. Um what's behind it? Is it the Azure growth? >> Software like Randy Dangerfield no respect. Uh it is incredible. Uh the Microsoft numbers were stable. Azure uh Office 365. Many of the numbers were just you know right in line and it wasn't a blowout. Uh the backlog's really good but I think this disclosure that OpenAI is 45% of their backlog. it goes back to the situation where can OpenI achieve these financial goals to to pay Oracle, Microsoft and many of the providers. So I think there's uh a number of factors that um are are working against Microsoft. We like it. We think it was a clean quarter, but I I think many of these overhangs of is AI going to pay off and and and can open AI follow through and and and and pay these balances is still in the wings. We think Open AI will. We think the the hatred towards OpenAI, it's it's it's shocking to me. It's like Google in Q1 last year when everyone thought Google was done because of uh AI and what it was going to do to their search business. And I I think that the same thing is to be said about OpenAI. Like they're they're not in the position that investors think that they are in our belief. So >> um but but Brent, they are in a position of having to continually raise capital in order to meet the obligations. I mean, I guess at bottom line, that's that is what is at the core of some concerns. >> Absolutely. And I what I'd say is I think that uh as long as OpenAI continues to deliver against these financial plans, they will be able to pay these bills. But that that again I agree it's the the concern. Um and I'm not discrediting the concern. I'm just think I think the concern is over uh overly concerned relative to what's happening. We saw the same thing with Google at the beginning of the year. So Microsoft again I think pretty consistent. Uh and I think the challenge for Microsoft is really what's going on at Meta at IBM. Look at the numbers at those companies. Meta blew up the revenue number. The guidance in the top line's incredible. The expenses are are higher, but they're not as bad as everyone feared. And so again, you you have a company that can do $30 of earnings power. 30 30 multiple gets you $900 of meta pretty easy. um and you don't have the open AI overhang. So I just think it goes back to software doesn't have the catalyst because there's so many inflections that are happening outside of our group in in other names like Meta, Amazon, Google, all the hyper all the energy names that that we uh that we cover. >> Thanks. Uh Sprint, we want to get back to you. I mean um Steve was sort of underscoring the point that you were making in terms of the concentration of the backlog and that was the problem with Oracle. Um it's a very different story though in terms of Oracle and Microsoft right I mean we're when we're thinking about the concentration of the backlog what can you tell investors uh who are worried about that concentration >> yeah for Oracle it is a big percent of their backlog as well and what I'd say is that Oracle and Microsoft are two completely different uh companies Microsoft's margins are going higher and Amy Hood has done a great job as a CFO managing and improving margins holding double digit growth and Microsoft is a more diverse business. They have an application business, a security business, an infrastructure business with Azure. You know, they just have more ores in the in the water and as we've said, they can monetize AI better than any software company because they've infused AI through each of those layers. And Nadella has done a phenomenal job of leading this. Oracle's coming from behind, right? They needed this $300 billion deal with OpenAI to get on the AI map and they got it and it's a great win for them, but Oracle has more potential in in my my opinion a few more hurdles to go through. So I just say like Microsoft is is always in our belief been a more diverse story. Oracle I think is is also probably underloved and and overk short term on the fear of open AI. Um, but they they they're both swimming in the same pool right now, which is no one no one's believing that that OpenAI can follow through with these commitments. And I think that we're going to be shocked that they probably will be able to. So then these stocks should effectively over time go higher. >> Open AAI now represents 45% of Microsoft's Azure backlog, which means Microsoft's AI growth story is tied directly to whether a company burning through tens of billions of dollars annually can actually pay its bills. Microsoft's post earnings Azure growth looks solid. Office 365 doing fine. Nothing really wrong with the numbers. But then investors see this disclosure. 45% of their Azure backlog is Open AI. And suddenly everyone's asking the same question. Can OpenAI actually follow through on these commitments? Because we're talking about a company that's expected to lose billions this year depending on whose math you trust. Brent Hill makes a good point about the comparison to Google earlier last year. Remember Q1, everyone thought Google was finished because AI was going to destroy search. The stock got hammered and then Google proved them wrong and the stock recovered. The argument here is that OpenAI skepticism might be similarly overblown. But there's a meaningful difference between the two situations. Google has a printing press. They generate something like $34 billion in net profit per quarter. If their AI bets don't work, they still have the core business. Open AI has no printing press. Their entire model depends on continuous fundraising. They've raised around $60 billion since 2022. They're now trying to get another $50 billion from the Saudis and HSBC estimates they'll be cash flow negative until at least 2030. That's a very different risk profile than Google having a bad quarter on AI sentiment. What makes this interesting from Microsoft is that Nadella has basically hedged against the worst case. He said publicly that even if OpenAI was worth zero, Microsoft keeps the co-pilot integration and the IP rights. Plus, the deal is now non-exclusive because OpenAI needed more money and Microsoft couldn't keep funding the burn rate alone. So, Microsoft gets exposure to the upside if Open AI figures it out and they've limited their downside if it all falls apart. That's actually pretty smart positioning for what amounts to a high stakes bet on someone else's business model. If you're trying to understand how these AI infrastructure deals actually work, the economics, the dependencies, why companies are making these kinds of bets, I made a course called the AI landscape that breaks all of this down step by step. Links in the description. You get lifetime access, and the price will be going up as we add new modules. So, that's the software side of AI. Companies placing bets on models and infrastructure, but Tesla's doing something completely different. In this next clip, we're seeing Tesla put $2 billion into Elon's AI company, XAI, as part of their pivot to what they're calling physical AI. And the interesting part isn't really the money. It's what this reveals about where Tesla thinks the actual value creation happens. The real headline here seems to be the continuing melding of all of Elon Musk's business all around, at least for right right now, is his main public vehicle, and that is Tesla, including news that it will invest $2 billion to buy preferred shares of his AI company, XAI. Bloomberg Tech co-host Ed Lello joining us right now to talk a little bit more about, I guess, the blurred lines when it comes to this Tesla business and which quite frankly might be the appeal for a lot of investors. Yeah, Tesla participated in the series E $2 billion of preferred stock and actually in the fine print of the shareholder deck, they even go further and explain the rationale that they have arranged a framework where Tesla can leverage XAI's work in models to accelerate what Tesla wants to do in the physical world. In other words, humanoid robotics and autonomous driving like in the deck. You're absolutely right, Roma. This could not be more clear. The breadand butter legacy business of selling EVs to consumers. Even the high-flying energy storage business is now kind of secondary to this focus of Tesla becoming a physical AI company. Reminder that actually when shareholders voted on the non-binding proposal for Tesla to invest in XAI in November, a lot of shareholders abstained because XAI is is a startup that's burning through billions of dollars of cash each quarter. And so even the most bullish names on Tesla look at that and say, \"Do you want Tesla, which is doing its own internal work on software and hardware and AI, to be carrying the bag on a lossmaking business like XAI, but they've pulled the trigger nonetheless.\" >> Yeah. Burning through billions when it comes to XAI, but uh set to get another two billion from Tesla. You mentioned that, you know, this is more about Tesla transitioning to a a physical AI company, but let's talk a little bit about the core business as it stands right now because you take a look at fourth quarter profits at and actually they weren't that bad. >> Weren't that bad there was growth in FSD subscriptions in the fourth quarter, active subscriptions and FSD now 1.1 million. And what Tesla does, like loads of companies, is put the the plus and minus columns together of factors. They're saying that going forward profit is going to be boosted by software sales, which if you believe in that long-term Tesla thesis, you want to hear. I'm just looking at the Bloomberg and like honestly like it's so important to just go back and check the data. We know what happened in 2025 with the second consecutive slide in deliveries, shrinking deliveries growth, but this was the first drop in annual revenues. So, while Tesla's been able to offset the the drop in consumer EV deliveries, um, bringing revenues to other places, revenue overall did fall year on year in 2025, and people will look at that because you have to remember that for all these long-term AI related goals, the board still requires Elon Musk as a mandatory target for his $1 trillion of potential compensation to deliver 20 million EVs to consumers over that period, meaning he has to average 500,000. But yeah, AI everything. >> Tesla's betting that the combination of AI models and realworld deployment, cars that drive, robots that work, creates a competitive moat that pure software AI companies can't replicate. They make this point about how Tesla's EV business and the high-flying energy business are now secondary to becoming a physical AI company. And I think that framing is exactly right. When you look at the shareholder deck, Tesla explicitly lays out a framework where they're using XAI's models to accelerate autonomous driving and humanoid robotics. The skepticism around this deal is real and the reporter touches on it. A lot of shareholders abstained from the vote because XAI is a startup burning through billions of dollars. Question is reasonable. Why should Tesla, which is doing its own AI work internally, be carrying the financial burden of another loss making company? But I think the answer comes back to something fundamental about how AI businesses work. Compare the position of XAI or OpenAI or anthropic. The pure AI companies have one product, one model. They're competing on benchmarking scores and API pricing and they have no secondary revenue engine when the margins get squeezed. Tesla has an auto business, an energy business, and now an AI business. If autonomy takes longer than expected, they still sell cars and batteries. Microsoft, Amazon, Google, same thing. They're all profitable despite AI spending, not because of it. The real play here is that Tesla wants to be the company that translates AI capability into physical world applications at scale. They've got billions of miles of real world FSD data. They're expected to get to 10 billion miles by June this year. They're hiring manufacturing engineers for cyber cap production. And now they've got a framework to pull XAI's model development into that physical deployment pipeline. The 2026 story for Tesla is about whether they can demonstrate that this physical AI thesis actually works, that the cars could truly drive themselves unsupervised and that the same technology transfers to robots. If they can pull that off, the XAI investment looks like a rounding error. Now, let's listen to Elon's shocking comments on the recent Tesla earnings call. >> I think we actually are headed to a future of universal high income. Not universal basic income, but universal high income. though I mean there's going to be a lot of change along the way but but that is uh that is the that is what I see as the most likely outcome. So, I think that's uh that it makes sense to update Tesla's mission to reflect that u that goal and um and obviously along that way we're going to keep improving safety, driving down the cost of goods and um and getting people access to anything they need uh without compromise and uh still making sure that the environment is great, nature is great, and people can have whatever they want, which seems like probably the best future. I'm open to other ideas, but that sounds like it sounds like it sounds like if you could say what is the best future you could possibly imagine, I I guess it would be that everyone can have whatever they want, including amazing medical care and but we still keep uh you know the beauty of nature and and uh and earth. I think that's probably the best outcome and uh and we're seeing obviously the first steps along that way this year for Tesla, first major steps as we increase vehicle autonomy and begin to produce uh Optimus robots at scale. We're we're making very big investments. This is going to be a very big capex year as Bible will will get into that that is deliberate u because we're making big investments for an epic future. So I think all these investments make a lot of sense. We'll continue to make sure that when we do spend capital, it is spent very efficiently. But it's it's a lot of things, you know, maj major investments in in in batteries and the entire supply chain for batteries. We're also going to uh be significant manufacturers of of solar cells and um and we're making massive investments in AI chips. Uh but I think these all make a ton of strategic sense. And um and then I guess I have like one I guess uh like it's not exactly it's it's not exactly bad news, but it's it's a uh it's it's well we're we're it's time to basically bring the Model S and X programs to um to an end with an honor honorable discharge because we're really moving into a future that is based on autonomy and um and so if if you're interested in buying a Model S X now would be the time to order it because we we expect to wind down SNX production next quarter and uh and basically stop production of Model SNX next quarter. We'll obviously continue to support the Model SNX programs for as long as people have the vehicles. But um but we're we're going to take the Model S next production space in our Fremont factory and convert that into an Optimus factory uh which uh will with the with the long-term goal of having a million units a year of Optimus robots in the current SX space in in Fremont. So that is uh it's slightly sad but it's but it is it is it is time to bring the SX program to to an end and shift shift really it's it's part of our overall shift to an autonomous future as my profile picture on on X said for few months there the future is autonomous and um so let's say with respect to full self driving and robo taxi people are obviously following with very close tension the progress of FSE and uh and and you can experience it for yourself if you've if you've got a Tesla. You can you notice with really with with every software update, the car gets better and better at autonomy and uh and and we're we uh were able to do our first uh rides with no safety monitor in the car in Austin. These were paid rides. So, these were I just sort of randomly selected paid rides with no safety monitor and um and and we I think maybe as of uh maybe yesterday or so, we we actually don't we don't even have a chase car or anything like that. So, these are just cars with no people in them and no one's following the car in in Austin. So, we we obviously are being very cautious about this because we want to have we want to have no act no injuries or or serious accidents along the way. So I think it it makes sense to be very cautious but you'll see the amount of autonomy increase dramatically I think every every month essentially and uh and and then there will also be an opportunity something we've talked about for a long time for existing owners of uh of Teslas to add or subtract their cars to the fleet. uh kind of like how Airb Airbnb works where you can add or subtract your house to the the Airbnb inventory and um and I think probably the value of the the Tesla the sort of partial people adding or subtracting their cars to Tesla autonomous fleet is probably a little underwrited by a lot of people because we've got millions of cars with AI4 that can do this. Um, so so that that that it it might potentially I I think it will provide an opportunity for a lot of customers to earn more by lending their car to the fleet than their lease cost to Tesla. >> Ads are expensive and people don't trust them anymore, but they do trust YouTube. That's why three of our clients now make $100,000 a month for their business from growing a YouTube channel. If you run a business, book a call with me and I'll help you map this"
