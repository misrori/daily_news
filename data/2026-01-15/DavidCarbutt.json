        "transcript": "Two huge partnerships just dropped in the same week and they're telling us the exact same story about where AI is heading. In the first clip, Nvidia and Eli Liy team up for a billion dollar drug discovery lab and I'll explain why this proves the application era of AI is finally here. >> Well, look, I think these are the trillion dollar club getting together. A billion dollars is probably a drop in the ocean for both of them. It's over five years and um what I think the aim of this at the end of the day is to try and automate and speed up as much of the uh partly the drudgery of doing lab work because lab work just like as if you were a doctor uh in in a clinic clinical setting you need to take a lot of notes a lot of details but at the same time I think they're investing in what appears to be automating 247 experiments things that human beings just can't do and and and I know having been a scientist that sometimes your life is on hold because you have to go back and deal with your experiments, your cells or whatever it is that you're running. And so a lot of these things I think could speed up and also make the life of the scientists a little bit easier. At the end of the day though, I think the aim here is to try and get scientific discoveries translated to drugs quicker and get them to market quicker. >> Sam, what does this mean for Eli Liy's rivals? Do you expect that we'll see some of its competitors also ramp up their AI endeavors given its partnership with a company like Nvidia? >> Well, a lot of pretty much all pharma companies and I just want to point you to a recent survey that BI Bloomberg Intelligence has done that looked at 10 different industries uh one of which being the pharmaceutical industry asked executives what are you doing with this? What are you trying to get to? What is the aim at the end? Everybody is at this. This is not something specific to Lily and you know Google for example has has through deep mind has created an agentic AI called Google scientist. It's like I think four agents or five agents who interact with each other and check each other's hypothesis. So a lot of this is going on in all companies. But of course here we have Lily, one of the richest pharma companies around in terms of the amount of cash flow that it's got really being able to uh spend the money without really impacting its um its balance sheet and cash flow and and and I'm pretty sure everybody's at this but clearly this is the news djour if you like. >> Nvidia is becoming the essential infrastructure layer that every major industry needs to plug into and this Eli Liy deal proves the application era has officially arrived. So, for years we've been hearing about how AI is going to revolutionize drug discovery. A decade to find a new drug sounds insane in 2026. Nvidia and Eli Liy are building 24/7 automated labs that do experiments while we sleep. Previously, scientists have had their lives on hold waiting for experiments to finish. That's about to be over. And Eli Lily, by the way, is sitting on a mountain of cash from their GLP1 drugs. Their market cap has skyrocketed under their current CEO. They can afford to make billion-dollar bets without flinching. This is exactly what I've been talking about with the transition from infrastructure buildout to actual applications. We spent the last 3 years watching companies buy TPUs and build data centers. That was phase one. Now, the hyperscalers have the compute. The question becomes, who's actually going to use it and solve real problems? Drug discovery is one of the most obvious answers. Finding compounds that bind to the right proteins without side effects, predicting how molecules will fold, running millions of simulations. These are problems that need massive compute, and also have massive payoffs if you crack them. The thing is, Nvidia keeps showing up in these deals as the essential partner. They're providing the entire stack. Alphold showed what's possible with protein folding. Deep Mind's Labs is also working with Eli Liy and Nvidia is positioning themselves at the center of all of it. They've got their omniverse platform for simulations, their custom chips, their software ecosystem. When Eli Liy wants to build an AI powered drug lab, there's really only one call to make. We keep hearing about AI valuations being disconnected from reality. People pointing at capex numbers and saying it's a bubble. But when you see a pharmaceutical giant like Eli Liy writing billion-dollar checks for AI infrastructure, that's real demand from a profitable company solving a real problem. Drug discovery that used to take a decade might take way less in the coming years. That's a company with actual products and actual revenue betting their future on this technology working. So Nvidia is becoming the infrastructure partner that everyone needs to work with. That brings us to the next clip because the same dynamic is playing out in consumer tech. Apple just made a move that tells you everything about where we are in the AI race. >> What did people get wrong about the Alphabet story? >> Look, I think if you go back a year ago, I mean, New York City cab driver was bearish on Google. I think it was the view first off DOJ was ultimately going to win that case and obviously Google won. But I think the biggest thing is that AI, the view AI was going to really ruin search. It was going to be the huge >> Yeah, you just AI, you would never search Google again. Where am I eating? You would just AI it it over Google's toast. The exact opposite has happened has happened. And that's why, look, now they're in the driver's seat. And when you think about where they are, I mean, we believe it's actually just the beginning for Google what they're doing. But it also speaks why for Apple they need to do the candlelight dinner you know between sun dar and cook because the only way Apple's in my opinion the watershed moment is ultimately Google next Siri that's going to be what I believe the consumer AI revolution ultimately goes to Apple and Google. >> There's a guy named Elon Musk. I don't know if you heard of him. >> I heard of him. >> Yeah. he's done okay in business and he uh ex tweeted out today that basically Alphabet, Google, and Apple teaming up maybe a little bit too close for comfort. He says this seems like an unreasonable concentration of power for Google given that they meaning Google also have Android the operating system and Chrome. I could make the case why he's saying that you've got Android and Google on a phone and the other operating system is Apple. Now they're coming together. Are you worried about that? >> Look, I mean it speaks to the point like that DOJ by Google winning that case that was significant because now Apple and Google really partner up. And look, I get what Musk is saying, but the reality is stronger going to get stronger. And when you look where Apple is, they need to go with Google. They they've obviously AI's been a huge disappointment for them. You look what Gemini's built. I mean, this is now what we're seeing this a this AI arms race that's playing out. Google went from bottom of the mountain to now at the top relative to what we're seeing with Gemma. >> Yeah. But is it do you think that regulators and I'm asking you obviously to editorialize and speculate, which is what we do? Why not? >> Of course, >> that reg if this happens and integrates in this new Siri upgrade that we referred to that regulators are going to come back and say this is too much. Google in an Apple phone, you got all the things. Yeah. And and I think that's why when once Google won that DOJ suit, big tech, you're a car guy. They got the engines ready, gasoline, left lane, 100 miles an hour, recognizing now's the time to do strategic partnerships like this to do acquisitions. And I think that's what we're going to see in the next few years. >> But it's kind of weird. Why would I I guess and Sundar Pachai could answer this a lot better. Why would Alphabet do this? Why would they want to make Apple products better when they have their own massively competing product? >> Sure. >> Or do they just not care? They just want to be everywhere. >> There is about 2.4 billion reasons, 2.4 billion iOS devices and about 1.5 billion reasons on the iPhone why they want to do this because for them, this is going to give them the opportunity to monetize within that install base. For Apple, they need Google relative to just the LM what's going to be ultimately a subscription model. So both companies need each other and I think they finally recognize but the reality is this never was going to be able to happen without that DOJ win. Apple partnering with Google on AI is at a mission that the application era rewards the companies who built the best models and Apple missed that window entirely. Dan Ives frames this as a mutual partnership where both companies need each other. And sure there's some truth there. Apple has 2.6 6 billion iOS devices and 1.5 billion iPhones. Google wants to access that install base. But let's be honest about what's really happening here. Apple spent the last few years building Vision Pro while everyone else was building language models. That was probably the wrong call. They had the resource to compete with OpenAI, with Google, and with Anthropic. They had more cash than anyone, and they built a headset that sits on a shelf. Now, the serious situation is actually embarrassing when you think about it. Apple had a voice assistant years before anyone else. First mover advantage big time. Hundreds of millions of people use chat GPT weekly. Now, those could have been Siri users. Apple could have owned the market. Instead, Siri became a punchline. Everyone made jokes about it not understanding basic commands. And now, Apple's solution is to let Google's Gemini power their AI features. That's Apple admitting they lost the model race and needs someone else's technology to stay competitive. What's interesting is Dan I's point about the DOJ case. Before the September 2025 remedies ruling, there was uncertainty about big tech partnerships facing regulatory push back. The ruling rejected harsh breakups and banned only exclusive deals while allowing non-exclusive payments to continue. This reduced major risks and helped clear the path for Boulder Moose. Now the gates are open. Google is pushing ahead. Turning around with Gemini from bottom of the mountain to top in roughly 18 months. That's an incredible turnaround. And partnering with Apple locks in their position even further. They already pay something like $20 billion a year to be the default search engine in Safari. Now they're going to power Siri 2. Elon's right. This concentration of power is kind of wild. But here's the connection back to the Nvidia story. Both deals show us that AI is consolidating around the companies who actually built the technology. Nvidia built the chips and the software stack that everyone needs for compute. Google built the models that Apple needs for consumer AI. These are platform plays. And if you're not a platform, you're a customer. Apple, one of the most valuable companies on Earth, just became a customer for AI. That's a massive shift in how we should think about the tech landscape going forward. The application era is about who controls the layers underneath. A lot of people want to understand AI properly but feel overwhelmed by the jargon. I created a structured course that explains the fundamentals in simple language and then moves into more advanced topics. You keep lifetime access to all current and future modules. And just a note, the price increases as new modules are added. So this will be the cheapest it would ever be and we're considering adding a new module soon. Ads are expensive and people don't trust them anymore, but they do trust YouTube. That's why three of our clients now make $100,000 a month for their business from growing a YouTube channel.

        "transcript": "Okay, ladies and gentlemen, I have three banger clips for you today. Firstly, we have Nvidia CEO Jensen Wang talking about a $500 trillion economy supercharged by AI. And then we have Jason Kalcanis saying nobody is ready for what Elon is building. And then to polish it off, we have a bonus clip from Jensen, Nvidia CEO, at the end. This is a juicy one. I'm fairly confident that AI will drive productivity, revenue growth, and therefore more hiring. There's a belief that the world's GDP is somehow limited at a hundred trillion. Well, what's likely to happen is AI is going to cause that hundred trillion to become $200 trillion, $300 trillion, $500 trillion. There's no fundamental limit to the size of a GDP. And so and the the number of people in the world that is participating in this GDP and the hundred trillion dollar GDP GDP is actually quite small. And so what if we brought the rest of the world the rest of society the rest of the world's population empower them with AI give them the opportunity to participate in the GDP and cause this GDP to quintuple. I think that's a very likely outcome and it's very likely that companies will become more prosperous. But it's for certain, this is for certain. Everybody's jobs will change as a result of AI. Some jobs will disappear. Obviously, every single industrial revolution, some jobs are just gone and but a whole bunch of new jobs are created. Everybody will have to use AI because if you don't use AI, you're going to lose your job to somebody who does. >> It feels like you're on top of the world right now. Is there anything you're envious of? You know, as I'm reflecting on, I have a pretty great life. I have an incredible family. I've known my wife since I was 17. Um, I've got two amazing kids, 34 and 35. Uh, although they didn't start out working at NVIDIA, both of them work at NVIDIA today. And and to be able to work hard and work hard with your kids on very important things and watch them come up with with incredible ideas, unique ideas, and do things that you never knew you could do yourself. um to watch him do that and um is it just brings me enormous joy. I obviously have a great company to to to be part of. Uh we're we're uh building the most impactful technology the world's ever known. Uh to be at the center of that is a great privilege and a great responsibility and of course comes with a great joy. And um uh and I have the support of of uh 40,000 employees. We have incredible retention. And I've worked with many of them multiple decades. And uh I've got two great dogs, you know, and and >> most importantly, >> yeah, I've got two great dogs. They both had their ultrasound today. They're apparently quite healthy. U you know, Lori takes incredible care of them and they're they're super fit. I Let's see what else can I think of. You know, uh I I have access to uh to uh friends and and partners all over the world. I get to travel. Um, I get to go to night markets. I get to enjoy fried chicken in Korea. I mean, what else does anybody want? You know, I think this is this is actually I would say for for any human, this would be a dream come true. AI isn't going to shrink the economy by taking jobs. It's going to explode the size of the entire economic pie by bringing billions of people into productive work they couldn't do before. Jensen's making a point a lot of people overlook when they panic about AI taking jobs. The global economy isn't some fixed pot of money we're all fighting over. Right now, we're at 100 trillion in GDP. And that number represents maybe 2 billion people doing productive work, knowledge work, and then the other 6 billion people on the planet. They are largely cut off from participating in the global economy in many meaningful ways either because they don't speak English, don't have access to education, or don't live near economic centers. AI changes that completely. Someone in rural India who speaks a local language can now use AI tools to do graphic design work for a client in New York. A kid in Nigeria who never went to college can build software with AI assistance and sell it globally. These aren't hypothetical scenarios. These are happening right now. AI acts like a universal translator and skills amplifier. You don't need to spend four years learning to code or 10 years mastering a craft. You need good ideas and the ability to work with AI tools. That's a much lower bar, which means way more people can participate. When you bring billions of people into the productive economy, you don't divide the same $100 trillion among more people. You grow the pie. Those new participants aren't just workers. They are also customers buying things, entrepreneurs starting companies, and creators making stuff people want. Jensen's estimate of $500 trillion sounds wild until you realize we're talking about 3 to 4x more people participating in the global economy at productivity levels we've never seen before. If AI makes the average knowledge worker 2 to 3x more productive, and you've got 5 billion people instead of 2 billion people doing that work, you get exponential growth. The job displacement fears aren't wrong. Some jobs will vanish just like every industrial revolution. But history shows pretty clearly what happens when you make people more productive. You create more wealth which creates new industries which creates new jobs nobody predicted. In the 1900s 40% of American workers worked in agriculture. Today it's 2% but we're not sitting around with 38% unemployment. Those people moved into jobs that didn't exist in the 1900s. software engineers, data scientists, social media managers, podcast hosts, the jobs AI will create in 2030 probably don't have names yet, but there exists because the economy will be so much bigger than it is today. Quick plug, I made the AI course I wish I had when I started studying the niche. It breaks down everything in bite-sized chunks in a way which I think is super important for anyone following tech, stocks, and AI these days. If you're interested, check out the description below to gain lifetime access and the price increases when we add new modules, which we are thinking of doing soon. Now, check out Jcal and what he feels after taking a visit to Tesla's factory. >> I would I would dub 2026 CES as self-driving CES. I will dub 2027 as robotics, humanoid robotics specifically. We're starting, obviously, people are showing off all these incredible robots here, but I think consumers will be experiencing them in 27, but consumers are experiencing this year self-driving. Neuro and Lucid have an incredible product. Zuks has been here. Obviously, Elon's doing great things with Roboaxi. Feels like he's closing in on a solution and getting very close. Whimo obviously is leading the pack, but then you also have BYU, Alibaba, Wei, Pony. This is a global race. What will the world look like in 2026 in terms of self-driving and then any second and third order impacts of those and then do the same for robotics. >> If you go around the world today, right, you you go to Europe, you go to the Middle East where um you know there's a there is focus on interesting luxury products. There's a market for it. BYD and a lot of these Chinese companies are actually penetrating deeply everywhere because these these cap these companies have all the features and functionality and they're really low cost and so one thing is that the the the dynamic of the auto industry and European auto makers are all very dejected because they don't know how they're going to compete with Chinese industry. US has innovation self-driving be innovation which allows you to say the next generation of winning automotive companies um will take advantage of this platform shift. US has the technology but it doesn't have the manufacturing uh capabilities to actually say can you actually make it as cost- effectively as uh a Chinese maker is going to be be. So it's not it's not as easy to figure out how the the world order around automotive is going to re shift around the world. uh and and so part of the physical AI and the use of AI in manufacturing is to figure out how do you design and manufacture um products next generation products right here uh in in the US in a way that mimics the cost advantages of of China so that then our innovation can then carry the data for us to be the global leaders yet again in this next phase so we have a company rebuild manufacturing that's focusing on this for example there's a lot of focus that needs to get on on that because if it's self-driving and it's not cost effective. Yeah, some of us will buy it, but it's never going to be a mainstream product because cost has I mean there's a reserve price that really shifts the demand patterns around automotive and you probably have good data on this as well. We should talk about that. But we we got to get the AI right and we got to get the manufacturing cost right as well. >> No, I think that there's a massive coming down the cost curve on this. I'm with you, Jason. think we're going to see literally over the next 12 to 24 months a massive transformation. I think the race is a foot, right? The race is a foot between a let's say a western stack and a and a Chinese stack on this and then in rest of world it'll be interesting as a battleground to see where that plays out. But and you and I were were talking a little bit about this. I think that is a massive trend. I think a larger trend will be the trend um to robotics and and not just for human interaction but in manufacturing and and when you think about the challenges that um the western world faces. So take the US. I was talking to the CEO of one of the large contract manufacturers and she has 50,000 job openings right now for US manufacturing jobs in America that she can't fill. >> Right? And our demographics aren't getting better on this front. Germany is even worse situation. Korea, >> Germany, >> like another level. >> Yeah. >> And I think the only way that you build resilient supply chains at the cost point that you're talking about is it's going to be robotics at the heart. And and this race, I think, is wide open. Korea leads the way in robots per per worker, right? They're about 1 to 10 right now. Germany and China are tied at second and the US then is a distant third. And so there's a real race. You talked about the autonomy thing. I would actually jump to the robotics thing and wonder how >> one of the issues in robotics is so so when you build the LLMs you could dump them in the cloud experiment with something called chat GPD and becomes pervasive. If you have good robotics models what's next? You don't have a hardware um capability uh that's like an API infrastructure that diffuses those models fast. So like there's a lot that needs to get built. So I actually think robotics will be slower than people think in terms of really taking hold. But it's essential to go lead in that if you're going to lead in manufacturing and therefore have that core advantage to play up the stack in industries like automotive. There's no other way to do it. >> Yeah. I don't want to I don't want to name drop but I went two weeks two Sundays ago I went to Tesla with Elon and I went and visited the Optimus lab. There were a large number of people working on a Sunday at 10 a.m. >> Yeah. and I saw Optimus 3. I can tell you now, nobody will remember that Tesla ever made a car. They will only remember the Optimus and that he is going to make a billion of those. And it is going to be the most transformative technology product ever made in the history of humanity because what LLM are going to enable those products to do is understand the world and then do things in the world that we don't want to do. >> Yeah. I I believe it'll be a onetoone ratio of humans to optimists and I think he's already won but I don't want to speak out of school. >> Tesla is the only company on earth that's simultaneously worldclass at AI training, high volume manufacturing and grids scale energy which happens to be the exact three things you need to build a billion humanoid robots. Jason Kalcanes is saying Tesla will be remembered for Optimus and not cars and the reason comes down to the unique capabilities Tesla has that nobody else can match. They've trained full self-driving on billions of miles of real world data using their own custom AI chips and training infrastructure. That same AI stack that figures out how to drive in San Francisco traffic that translates directly to a robot understanding how to navigate a warehouse or fold laundry. They've already solved the hardest computer vision and decision-making problems at scale. And then manufacturing is where it gets pretty interesting. Tesla builds around 2 million cars a year. They are complex products with thousands of parts built in highly automated factories. They're not just buying robots from someone else to build their factories. They're designing and building their own manufacturing systems, which means they understand robotics from the inside out. So, when Elon talks about making a billion Optimus robots, he's pretty qualified to make this kind of prediction. Tesla already has the production infrastructure and expertise to scale mechanical products faster than maybe any company in history. They went from 0 to 2 million vehicles in about 15 years. A humanoid robot is mechanically simpler than a car. And then Tesla's battery piece of the puzzle is pretty interesting, too. Tesla's spent 15 years perfecting battery energy density, getting more power into less weight and space. The 4680 cells that they're producing now pack about 272 W hours per kilogram. That matters enormously when you're building a robot that needs to move around all day. Every pound of battery you can shave off while maintaining runtime means the robot can do more useful work. Tesla's also figured out thermal management of batteries so they don't underheat under sustained use and they manufacture these cells at volumes that brings costs way down. Put those three together and you see why Tesla's positioned differently than anyone else. Google has great AI but doesn't manufacture hardware at scale. Boston Dynamics builds impressive robots but doesn't have the battery technology or AI training infrastructure. Chinese manufacturers can build things cheaply but don't have Tesla's combination of AI sophistication, advanced battery tech, and systems integrations. Tesla's the only company where all three pieces, AI, manufacturing, and energy are already worldclass and operating at scale. Building a billion humanoid robots sounds impossible until you realize Tesla's already built most of the capabilities you need to do it. And now my bonus clip from Jensen. This is a banger. I would say that the world didn't realize is how deeply dependent we are in the AI industry on the brilliant students and the brilliant scientists of China. 50% of the world's AI researchers are from China. Their companies in China wants China to win. I think that's terrific. And I think the Chinese want China to win. I think that's terrific. We want America to win. and we can have a healthy competition while we compete, compete fairly, and collaborate at the same time. But I think the taking it emotionally too far from that um results in in consequences and relationships that are that are just harder to manage. you've been still unable to ship uh at the beginning of the administration your H20 chip to China and had argued uh successfully ultimately to the Trump administration for them to remove that export control. However, shortly after that uh commerce secretary Howard Lutnik said that the goal of American chip policy in that regard was to get China addicted to US chips. Um and that after that China turned around and said actually no we don't we don't want the H20 and since then you've uh publicly declared that you have no uh China revenue anymore. What was your response to to Lik's comments there? Well you know um it's unfortunate. Uh I I would say I would say um so first of all it's really important to understand what AI is. AI is not just a model. What AI what AI is is a full stack of reinvention of every single layer of the technology stack. AI is about energy. That's the reason why we're talking about energy all the time. When President Trump came into office and he was pro- energy growth. If it wasn't because of his posture on energy growth, the United States would have been in a very bad way. We would have had no energy, no incremental energy necessary to grow this incredibly important industry. So his growth posture, his grow energy growth policy is incredibly helpful. But we have to win every other layer as well. The next layer is chips. The layer after that is infrastructure, cloud services. the liar after that um large language models or AI models and of course very importantly AI applications. The United States has if we if we hope to take advantage of this next industrial revolution and this will be the largest industrial revolution of all of the industrial revolutions. And so every layer of that stack we must be determined to win. But if we allow all of the layers to only be as successful as the least successful layer, then United States will fall behind. No doubt. Our belief and what I've explained is that in the layer of chips, the single most important thing is to make sure that every single model in the world runs on American techstack and that the American tech stack is everywhere in the world. So that you know American text stack becomes if you will the global standard. There's a belief that somehow if we provided American chips to uh foreign foreign countries and specifically China that the Chinese military would be building their military and building um airplanes and aircraft carriers using American chips. Well, first of all, they have plenty of their own chips and their companies are formidable. The idea that China does not have technology industry we now know is lunacy and we the idea that China is not able to manufacture would suggest somebody is had their head deeply in the sand. The ability for us to engage the China market, compete freely there, earn our business, earn our business is great for um great for America. It's great for the American people. It allows us to uh generate revenues for the United States. And as you know, the country that is most secure, has the mightiest military is because it's also the wealthiest country. And so we want America to be the wealthiest country so that we can fund the mightiest military. And I I think that that is our way of contributing to national security.
