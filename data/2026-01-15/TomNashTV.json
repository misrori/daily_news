        "transcript": "This stock may have the biggest potential for 2026 and I've never talked about it before. Now, with the past five years, I talked about a lot of great stocks. Palanteer and Nvidia back in 2020. Both did 1200%. We talked about AMD and Oracle and Fortnet back in 2021 up 200%. SFI, Arista up 200% since 2023. But the one thing I've never done, never ever in my life is look at price. Okay? In the words of Peter Lynch, it's never a bad time to buy a great company. You don't want to buy things that are cheap. You want to buy things that are good. >> Now, quite a few of these companies, which we talked about here for the past 5 years and have created generational wealth for a lot of my viewers, my academy members, they were already expensive when we talked about them. They went up parabolically. They had high PE. And the company I'm talking about today pretty much has the same thing. It's up almost 50% over the past month. It's up 500% of the past year. But just as I said, the price doesn't scare me at all. I don't look at price. I look at whether this company has the potential and what is the likelihood of that potential to materialize to dominate in the next 5 to 10 years. The company is Bloom Energy. The ticker is Be. And I can already hear the comments. It went up parabolically. It's vertical. Blah blah blah. Tom, you don't know what you're doing. I don't care. Now, if I listened to you all back in 2021 when Palunteer went from 35 to six, I would have missed out on the greatest generational wealth creator of our lifetime. You don't buy companies because of price. You don't want to miss on generational wealth because a stock went up recently. You have to understand the difference between price and value. Even a company that went up like crazy can still be mispriced. The market is right now looking at this company at Bloom Energy, just like it did at Palanteer as a consultancy, just like it did at Tesla as a car company. They're seeing an alternative energy company which is nothing to write home about. when in fact this company is literally solving the greatest bottleneck in AI. >> Data centers could reach a whopping 16% of total US power consumption by 2030. According to one report, up from just 2.5% before chat GBT hit the scene in 2022. That's the equivalent of about 2/3 of the total homes in the US. Natural gas is expected to fuel the majority of this and utilities will need to invest some 50 billion to support the growth. Even when enough power can be generated, the aging grid is often illequipped to handle transmitting it. The bottleneck often occurs in getting power from the site where it's generated to where it's consumed. The average transformer in the US is 38 years old. So, the aging devices have become a common cause for power outages, and replacing them is expensive and slow. >> We have trillions of dollars going into AI right now. We have data centers being built left and right, but the biggest problem according to every single expert right now is power. And the problem is that the electrical grid is not set up to meet these demands and we need about a decade to upgrade the power grid. The problem is we need power today. Nobody's going to sit around and wait for that. So Bloom Energy, the company I'm presenting to you today. By the way, I'm not affiliated, not paid. I've never spoke to these guys. Just my opinion, right? Bloom Energy is the only company that solves this problem on Earth. So what these guys do, they can literally drop a box like in a sci-fi film in a parking lot of a data center and give you 24/7 power uninterrupted with zero connectivity to the grid. Now you have to understand that the grid has a language. That language is AC. That's English AC power. Your computer, your laptop is working in DC. That's Japanese, right? And you know this brick that you're shleing all over the place, the big black brick that heats up like a mother lover. Well, that's the translator, right? And that's how you translate from AC to DC. And by the way, when you're trying to translate that for a data center with lots and lots of supercomputers that is no longer a brick. That's a whole building and it heats up hotter than the inferno and you need to cool it. You need to power. It's a huge waste of energy. It's inefficient. It's expensive and it's not sustainable long term. So, Bloom Energy actually solved this problem. And this is how you know Nvidia's new chips, the Blackwell, well, they operate on DC at 800 volts. And if you use the normal power grid, well, you're going to have to translate that electricity three or four times. Now, that's a lot of energy loss and that's very expensive and you need to cool this and it's insane, right? Bloom Energy actually makes a box that you place outside the data center with zero connection to the grid and it creates electricity through a chemical reaction using natural gas. Now the most important part about this isn't what I just told you is the fact that the output that these boxes give you and this is the crazy part are literally 800 volts of DC. Exactly what these Nvidia Blackwell chips require. Maybe this is pure accident. Maybe it's a stroke of genius by Bloom Energy. I don't know. whatever it is, it is pretty freaking insane for bloom. So, globally, we make about 100 gawatt of new natural gas every year. According to all estimates, AI is going to demand about 50% of that. And you can't use turbines and solar panels exclusively because guess what? Solar panels don't work at night. Turbines don't work when it's not windy. So, you need power and you need reliable power. These things are operating at 100% capacity 24/7, 365 days a week. These data centers, they don't take it off. There is no vacation days. I mean, they need power nonstop. Why don't you just plug these data centers into the power grid and get it over with? Why do you need these natural gas boom boxes? Well, guess what? To upgrade the grid to meet this demand, you need about 7 to 10 years. Now, nobody in the AI industry is going to sit around wait for 10 years. It's not going to happen. And that's why Bloom Energy has a massive moat most people on Wall Street are missing. You drop this thing in the parking lot and you have electricity without the grid. The grid is basically obsolete. The best solution for data center power is in the hands of Bloom Energy. And they're literally the only game in town which is insanely exciting. Now on Wall Street, you got to look at what people are doing, not what they're saying. media is screaming about this technology being unproven and risky and all of that, which may be true, right? But Larry Ellison, one of the richest people in the planet, just wrote them a big check. He just signed a big deal with them to supply Oracle infrastructure, the cloud infrastructure with energy through these boom boxes. But the more interesting part about this deal, he actually got some warrants, three and a half million shares, six-month warrant at $113 per share. That means Larry Ellison is estimating that this company is worth about 27 billion dollars. Not far from today's 30 billion market cap, even after that 500% spike over the past year. When a company like Oracle with their lawyers and accountants and the army of experts are saying this is a $30 billion company, well, you got to listen. Now, why isn't everybody doing it? Where's the other hyperscalers? Well, they're cowards and they're complacent and they're in the sheep mentality. They don't need it. They already have the market. Oracle is chasing, right? So, they're basically saying, \"Look, we're going to wait and see for Oracle. If Oracle makes it with these guys, we're going to jump in. And if not, okay, so if Oracle actually makes this, if Larry Ellison isn't wrong about this, by the way, Larry Ellison wasn't wrong about Tesla when everybody were doubting. He's pretty smart.\" So if Larry Ellison hits this correctly and they all have to jump in, the wait and see part is over, which means the floodgates will be open, which means this company is no longer going to be the palunteer of 2022 with $6 per share. Right now, I'm not saying this is next palenteer. I'm just saying the same dynamic. So we have the technology with Nvidia chips, perfect match. We have the validation from Larry Ellison and Oracle. Now let's talk about valuation. Right? So before we start, a little word of warning here, right? This is a very volatile stock. Just like Palunteer, it can drop 50% in 3 days. It can go from 130 to 30 within a couple of weeks. Just like Palunteer went from 35 to 6 in 2022, it can happen. It's a very volatile stock and not want to be messed with. Now, long-term a whole different story. Let's do the napkin math. Okay, so we have 100 gawatts of power. We already said that. 50% of that is going to go to AI. So, that's 50 gawatts of power. Now, Bloom doesn't have to own the entire market. In fact, they don't need to own 50% of the market. Even though they're the only game in town right now, if they just jump at 20% of the market, that means 10 gigawatts per year. At 3 million per megawatt, that's 30 billion. That's 1,400% increase in revenue. 10 billion net income from that number, which would be a 30% net margin, which is for this sort of company is pretty normal, right? So 10 billion at 200 million shares, 240 million shares, that's about $40 per share at EPS. Now, we're going to use a 25x multiple because this is not some utility company. This is a critical AI infrastructure business. So $40 times 25 multiple, we're talking about $1,000 per share currently trading at 130, 640% gain, 7 and a half times your money by 2030 if they execute. And remember, they don't need a monopoly. They need 20% of the market. And here's the thing, there's a reason why it's trading at 130 and not $1,000. And you have to be the adult here and not just assume the risk isn't going to pan out. You have to consider it, right? Number one, the management has a track record of missing earnings, overpromising, underdelivering, and Wall Street freaking hates that, rightfully so. The other thing is that the whole AI thing might be a bubble if you believe Michael Bur and it's basically one circle transaction when nobody really makes money, right? So if these either of these risks materializes, well, you're going to lose some money. But I personally don't see the Michael Bur argument, right? Not talking about the management right now, they're going to have to execute. Let's see. But Michael Bur, hey, so much money being spent, so much money being made, so many AI applications. This isn't pets.com 1999. I just don't buy that. Right? So, the risks are real, but here's the thing. The only thing that needs to happen here realistically is for the management not to screw it up. So, yes, the risks are real, but if the management doesn't screw it up, if they execute, now the fundamentals are not bad. 44% growth in revenue over the past year, 174% growth over the past 5 years. Net income up 113% over the past year, $135 million of free cash flow, and 140% increase in a year. But if you go to Stock MVP and you put it through the scorecard, the results aren't great. 65 out of 100. The P ratio is too high. There's too much debt. There's too much short interest at 12%. And by the way, Stock MVP is my own platform. I've built it for you. So you can analyze, break down, and look through the financials and the fundamentals of companies, not the noise you hear in mainstream media. Go get it right now. And for the next few days, you can try it out for 7 days for free. So there are growing pains here. It doesn't pass this scorecard with flying colors. There's issues with this stock that require time and require management execution. So, how do we play this? Number one, you're not going to trade this stock. If you are, good luck to you. You're about to get wrecked because this stock is a roller coaster. It can drop 30% in two days. It can drop 50% in a week. The strategy here is very, very simple. Dollar cost average. It's boring. It's lame. There's no dopamine here, right? It's a fiveyear play minimum. Every time the stock drops 20% below the 52- week high, boom, you double down. Every time it goes up, you slow down. But you DCA the whole time if you believe the thesis, if you love the company. But as simple as the strategy sounds, you have to understand the nuance. You have to understand the mechanics, the intricacies. Right? I've actually laid out the whole strategy A to Zed for you for free. It's available right now to download in the description section. Go to the description section, click the link, you'll get it for free. It's a 25page full-on a toz summary of how to utilize the strategy. It's my gift to you. Go get it right now. Now, the downside risk here is real. The management has made a lot of kuffles in the past. If the management screws up, you're going to lose 30 to 50% of your money. That's painful, but the reward is extremely insanely higher than that. We're talking 7x on your money if the management does not screw it up. So minus 50% versus 7x. This is what I call an asmmetric bet. But it all depends on what do you think about the thesis? What do you think about their ability to dominate the next 5 to 10 years, not the current price and not the hoopla you're going to see in the media. Now, the grid is broken. AI demand for power is insane. Bloom right now is the only game in town. This is why I love this stock for the next 5 to 10 years. Now, if you want to learn more about how to find companies like Bloom, how we found AET, Sofi, bunch of other stocks, hundreds of percents, you're welcome to join the academy, but it's not for anyone.
