    "transcript": "Oh  yes.  Oh  yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Guys,  welcome   to  another  episode.  And  as  you  can  see   right  now,  Bitcoin  is  still  at  around   $68,000.   And  if  you're  part  of  Bull  Mania,  we  did   discuss  yesterday  that  we  may  actually   have  a  bit  of  a  boring  time  ahead  where   Bitcoin  is  likely  to  chop  sideways   before  going  lower  into  the  buy  zone  and   then  recovering  from  the  buy  zone  later   in  the  year.  I  mean  a  trajectory  like   this  for  Bitcoin  would  be  super  super   super  super  expected.  Of  course,  we   don't  predict.  We  just  react  whenever   something  happens.  For  example,  when  we   are  in  the  buy  zone,  we  can  DCA  here   knowing  that  it's  a  good  long-term  buy   zone.  And  especially  if  we  go  to  bull   trend  on  the  money  line  is  going  to  be   insane.  But  I  also  want  to  highlight   something  else  that's  very  very   important,  guys.  And  that's  that  tech   stocks  are  currently  getting  hammered.  I   just  tweeted  before  going  live  that  tech   stocks  won't  be  replaced  by  vibe  coded   alternatives  and  I'm  a  buyer  of  tech   stocks  if  they  are  at  or  below  200  week   moving  average  when  it  comes  to  cheap   deals  in  the  market  guys  I  can  tell  that   Bitcoin  now  is  getting  quite  cheap   because  it  is  around  200  week  can  still   go  lower  we  expect  it  to  go  lower  even   and  the  same  is  true  for  many  tech   stocks  because  there  is  this   misunderstanding  that  many  investors   have  that  somehow  AI  is  going  to  replace   them.  I  can  tell  you  that  as  a  computer   scientist  also  as  someone  who  is  vibe   coding  every  day  there  is  no  way  vibe   coding  is  going  to  replace  the  big  tech   stocks  like  uh  Google  Microsoft  even   when  you  look  at  CRM  tools  like   Salesforce  in  it  accounting  and  other   other  software  business  software  it's   going  to  be  super  hard  for  vibe  coders   to  do  anything  okay  it's  not  possible  if   you've  tried  vibe  coding  actually  using   not  just  v  coding  something  for  the  sake   of  a  demo  or  v  coding  something  just  to   test  something  quickly.  If  you  actually   tried  going  in  production  with  any  of   the  vibe  coding,  you  know,  it  becomes   complex  quite  quickly.  And  the  amount  of   energy  and  money  you  would  be  putting   onto  fixing  your  vibe  coded  duct  tape   crap  solution,  you  would  better  buy  just   a  cheap  subscription  to  a  SAS  that  fixes   it.  Now,  will  all  companies  benefit  from   AI?  I  mean  some  some  dinosaurs  will   probably  die.  But  it's  very  important  to   understand  that  if  you  have  a  quality   company,  AI  is  likely  to  help  them   because  if  they  have  a  good  strategy,   they  have  a  good  client  base,  they  can   use  AI  to  be  even  better.  So  looking  at   many  texts,  I  mean,  let's  just  look  at   if  you're  looking  at  the  Google,  Google   now  entering  a  bare  trend.  If  it  gets  if   it  gets  even  to  50  moving  average,  which   would  be  a  fantastic  discount,  uh  I'm  a   buyer  here  for  Google.  Even  the  50  week   is  fantastic.  Looking  at  Amazon,  Amazon   is  already  below  the  50  week.  The  next   one  is  the  200  week.  It's  crazy  crazy   value  zone  for  uh  for  Amazon.  So  keep   those  in  mind.  Uh  Apple  still  doing   quite  okay.  Not  really  pure  software.  So   it's  not  as  a  affected  as  others  when  it   comes  to  the  uh  fear  of  of  AI,  but  keep   an  eye  there.  And  then  you  have  the   classic  software  that  people  are  so   scared  about.  Let's  say  Salesforce,  look   at  the  hammering  that  Salesforce  has  had   during  the  last  um  months  and  even  the   last  year.  I  mean  2025,  it  is  down  so   much.  I  mean  from  this  peak,  how  much  is   down?  Is  down  50%.  Now,  as  you  know,   something  that's  down  a  lot  can  still  go   down  lower.  But  here's  an  example  where   as  soon  it  gets  into  a  bull  trend,  it  is   an  interesting  bet  to  take.  Why?  Because   it  is  below  the  200  week,  it's  below  the   50WE.  You  have  all  of  the  uh  value   signals  uh  flashing.  So,  as  soon  as  you   have  a  rebirth  in  it  and  um  a  a  strong  a   strong  trend  to  the  upside,  uh  it's  a   no-brainer.  It's  a  no-brainer.  The  same   thing  is  looking  at  Adobe,  many  people   say  is  it's  that  this  and  that.  Uh  it's   also  very  very  cheap.  I  mean,  below  the   50WE,  below  the  200  week,  uh  as  soon  as   it  gets  into  bull  trend,  it's  worth   taking  the  shot.  It  could  be  a  fake  out   like  here  it  was  a  fake  out,  but  always   worth  taking  a  shot  on  bull  trends  for   undervalued  undervalued  assets.  uh  below   50  week  below  100  I  mean  it's  below  200   below  200  week  below  50  week  in  this   case  also  below  the  100  week  it's  it   makes  sense  so  I  know  normally  we  speak   about  crypto  but  also  I  know  that  many   of  you  guys  want  me  to  speak  about   stocks  whenever  we  speak  about  stocks  in   bullmania  community  many  people  love   that  so  I  thought  I  would  share  it  as   well  because  yes  crypto  is  going  to  be   in  super  buy  zone  but  the  stocks  are   also  an  asset  class  which  is  super   volatile  so  if  you  want  to  make  money   you  love  trading  but  also  you  want  to   invest  for  the  long  term  you  cannot   ignore  stock.  That's  why  we  are  more  of   a  360  kind  of  investors  now.  We're  not   only  crypto.  If  you  look  this  at  this   channel,  let's  say  two  years  ago,  even   one  year  ago,  we  were  more  focused  on   crypto  only.  But  the  thing  is,  crypto  is   now  getting  so  big  and  stocks  are   getting  more  volatile.  So,  crypto  is   getting  bigger.  So,  it  is  a  proper  asset   class  alongside  stocks  and  gold  and   everything,  but  also  stocks  are  super   volatile.  So,  there  are  many   opportunities  there  as  well.  If  you   catch  a  nice  bull  trend  in  a  stock,  in  a   tech  stock,  it's  fantastic.  I  mean  it   can  give  you  more  returns  than  many  than   many  coins  than  many  altcoins  in   especially  in  this  environment.  So  we're   looking  at  that  then  what  else  you  have   uh  into  it  looking  at  into  it  massive   bare  trend  people  think  that  we're  going   to  do  accounting  with  vibe  coding  I  can   tell  you  that  as  computer  scientist   someone  who  does  vibe  coding  a  lot  for   for  our  business  it  won't  happen.  I  mean   vibe  coding  the  you  know  the  the  number   one  uh  person  that  should  be  worried   about  vibe  coding  is  the  middle  manager   who  communi  who  coordinates  a  bunch  of   people  okay  because  the  what  vibe   causing  and  AI  can  do  it's  really  remove   a  bunch  of  workers  you  don't  need  and   then  you  don't  need  as  many  middle   managers  if  you  have  let's  say  a  CEO  he   could  already  do  a  prototype  quite   nicely  with  vibe  coding  so  you  don't   need  that  many  know  product  managers  and   all  of  this  middle  middle  management   crap  just  remove  them.  So  if  you  are  a   worker,  if  you  are  a  tech  worker,  you   should  be  very  scared.  But  if  you  are  a   shareholder,  you  should  be  very  excited   because  the  number  one  cost  of  any   business  is  the  worker.  So  if  you  can   remove  the  worker,  you  can  put  AI  way   better.  So  that's  why  I  think  it's  going   to  uh  it's  going  to  really  come  back  in   a  big  way  a  lot  of  this  uh  stones  that   are  getting  sold  and  hammered  like  there   is  no  tomorrow.  So  in  it  is  another   example.  It's  below  the  50  week,  below   the  200  week,  still  a  falling  knife.   Still  the  chart  is  ugly  as  hell.  You   don't  want  to  catch  a  falling  knife.  But   as  as  soon  as  it  starts  to  uh  bottom   out,  go  a  bit  sideways  and  go  into  bull   trend.  Fantastic  opportunity.  Fantastic   opportunity.  Let's  look  into  Palance   here.  I  don't  think  anyone  thinks  that   is  you  know  the  governments  are  going  to   vibe  code  balance  here.  But  um  another   example  where  it's  falling  below  50  and   if  it  ever  gets  to  200,  holy  crap,  it's   very  very  good  value  zone.  So  that's  the   that's  the  current  situation  when  it   comes  to  the  overall  market.  And  I  did   put  it  in  my  track  record.  So  if  you  go   to  bullming.com/ivan,   you  see  my  track  record.  I  mean,  you  see   everything  when  we  called  to  drisk  back   in  October,  then  what  happened  in   November,  you  see  all  of  the  Twitter   posts  as  proof.  You  can  go  to   bulling.com/  Ivan  at  any  point.  For   example,  we  said  to  be  careful  with   silver  and  gold  here  in  at  the  end  of   January.  Uh  we  also  said  to  start  buying   super  slowly  within  the  buy  zone  because   we  touched  the  buy  zone  in  February.  And   now  today  I  also  added  this  where  when   it  comes  to  tech  talks  I  think  we're   going  to  look  back  let's  say  in  a  year   at  many  of  them  and  uh  thinking  holy   crap  apparently  apparently  AI  did  not   kill  them.  Apparently  AI  did  not  kill   them.  Uh  but  again  AI  will  destroy  you   if  you  are  a  tech  worker  you  you  work  in   these  companies.  H  you  may  or  may  not  be   needed  in  the  same  extent.  Just  to  put   it  bluntly  if  you  are  an  accountant  even   a  lawyer  or  or  a  you  know  some  kind  of   legal  professional  you  may  or  may  not  be   needed.  But  again  here  we're  not   speaking  about  job  loss.  I  mean  in   reality  job  loss  is  kind  of  good  for   many  companies  because  it's  the  number   one  expense.  So  as  a  shareholder  it's   fantastic.  It's  fantastic.  AI  is   efficiency.  AI  is  less  coordination  less   meetings  more  signal.  So  all  in  all  I   think  for  shareholders  going  to  be   great.  If  you  are  a  tech  worker  be  be   careful  man.  Be  careful.  Then  AI  is   serious.  You  should  take  AI  seriously.   Now  guess  looking  let's  go  back  into  the   crypto  world.  Looking  at  our  community   still  the  shorters  are  winning.  It  is  I   don't  see  anyone  doing  any  long  trade  uh   and  posting  it  now.  So  it  is  still  the   uh  the  the  shorters.  You  have  hip   posting  shorting  XRP.  Fantastic  gain   71%.  You  have  Jacobus  continuing   shorting  also  XRP  and  and  TZOs.  Man,   Tzos  is  still  here.  It's  crazy,  man.   Some  of  these  some  of  these  chains,  man,   they  never  die.  So,  yeah,  shorting  in   this  environment  is  is  uh  is  the  way,  uh   you  have  TT  shorting  stable.  And  by  the   way,  one  thing,  even  if  you  don't  if  you   don't  have  Bulmania,  which  you  should,   but  let's  say  you  don't,  you  can  just   see  whenever  something  gets  a  bit  of  a   pump.  For  example,  if  you  look  at  the   weekly,  you  see  a  lot  of  these  coins  are   up.  Uh  and  uh  the  question  is  uh  what   what  kind  of  gravity  will  pull  them   back?  Because  there's  a  lot  of  gravity.   You  understand  that  if  you  look  at   monthly,  it's  a  it's  a  graveyard.  It's  a   graveyard.  If  you  look  at  weekly,  it  is   a  bit  of  a  green,  but  you  understand   that  the  gravity  is  still  super  strong.   Bitcoin  is  still  bearish.  Okay?  And  with   the  mechanical  rules  with  having  a  good   stop-loss  position  size,  uh,  shorting  a   lot  of  these  temporary  pumps  is   fantastic.  I  mean,  in  this  day  and  age   where  we  are  now  in  in  the  bear,  it's   fantastic.  Obviously,  you  never  know,   maybe  we're  going  to  have  a  marketwide   relief  rally.  So,  we  always  have  stop   loss.  We  always  always  have  position   sizing  because  uh  we're  not  basing  on   any  certainty.  It's  an  uncertain  world.   If  you  are  in  any  market,  you're  making   any  trade,  you're  working  with   uncertainty,  which  means  that  it  can  go   against  you.  If  it  goes  against  you,   position  size,  stop  loss,  everything  is   in  place.  So  you  have  infinite  upside,   but  your  downside  is  limited.  That's   exactly  exactly  exactly  how  we  like  it.   Um  so  we're  seeing  more  and  more  um  over   uh  overperformance  uh  by  the  by  the   shorters.  Uh  and  as  soon  as  I  see  the   trend  change,  we're  going  to  let  you   know.  Uh  also  some  comments,  this  this   one  is  from  YouTube  came  for  Bitcoin   stayed  for  the  tangent.  Big  shout  out  to   Ayana  because  sometimes  on  Q&A  we  go  on   all  kinds  of  t  tangents  and  Zuma  going   to  go  to  Q&A  in  this  stream  as  well.   Scopek  from  the  discord  from  Bullman  is   saying  I  have  to  say  I'm  also  very  calm   this  time.  I  was  so  reckless  and  doing   so  fast  therefore  bad  decisions  last  two   cycles  going  all  in  and  not  having  a   good  sleep  at  all.  Lol.  It  is  just  the   exact  opposite  this  cycle  bare  market.   Thanks  to  bull  mania  of  course  I  have   robust  uh  plan  and  I'm  following  uh  I'm   following  it  which  I  totally  liked  in   the  past.  Everything  seems  so  clear.  I   mean  that's  the  most  important  thing  is   that's  the  most  important  thing  that  you   feel  if  you  are  part  of  bullmania  that   you  have  control.  You  are  in  charge.  The   market  is  not  in  charge  of  you.  You  are   in  charge.  The  average  player  but  they   are  at  the  mercy  of  the  market.  They're   praying.  They're  begging.  But  as  a   trader  you  have  to  be  in  charge.  You   dictate  what  happens.  And  if  the  market   goes  against  you,  you're  out.  You're   out.  By  the  way,  it's  also  a  good  idea   to  think  like  that  in  many   relationships.  If  you  have  a  bad   relationship  or  you  know  whether  it's   professional,  romantic  or  whatever,  you   have  to  clean.  You  have  to  clean.  You   have a  stop-loss,  you're  out.  You're   out.  Okay.  This  the  trading  philosophy   really  applies  to  to  life  as  well.  It's   overall  you  need  to  be  in  control  of   your  destiny.  And  that's  very  important.   With  mechanical  rules,  you  are  without   you're  not.  Also,  each  and  every  week  on   Fridays,  we  do  a  long  Q&A  with  Jason.

Uh  guys,  let's  see  the  overall  sentiment   now.  So,  Bob  Lucas  is  saying  something   very  important  and  that's  that  uh  stocks   may  go  down  further  and  for  us  who  are   interested  in  cheap  cheap  tech  stocks,   it's  important  to  keep  in  mind  that  many   of  them  are  still  uh  falling  knives.  I   mean  into  it,  Salesforce,   um  Tesla,  not  really  Adobe,  they're   still  falling.  So  we  are  waiting  for   [ __ ]  but  just  to  keep  it  on  your   radar  because  whenever  you  make  a   decision,  it's  good  to  be  mentally   prepared,  like  mentally  prepared.  So  we   are,  for example,  we  are  seeing  a  lot  of   value  in  tech  stocks.  We  cannot  buy  a   falling  knife.  So  they  either  need  to  be   super  cheap  at  like  200  week  moving   average,  they  come  to  200  moving  average   in  a  very  long  time,  then  you  you  know   it's  good  value.  It's  good  value.  Can   still  go  lower,  but  it's  good  value   normally.  or  um  which  I  would  prefer   even  more  that  they  go  into  bull  trend   on  on  the  weekly.  So  we  keep  that  in   mind  and  if  it  is  the  case  that  we  have   a  uh  a  bit  of  a  bare  cycle  here  with  the   stocks  towards  the  June  u  June  time   approximately  uh  then  it's  just  another   another  signal  to  be  to  be  bullish  here   as  we  then  exit  exit  this  this  bare   target  that  uh  Bob  Lucas  has.  Bob  Lucas   also  says  that  you  know  crypto  looks   horrible.  I  agree.  I  agree.  Bitcoin   looks  very  bad  but  200  moving  average   buy  zone  still  fantastic.  Uh  he's  saying   Bitcoin  price  action  remains  horrendous   very  very  weak  after  the  recent  flash   out  a  natural  sharp  counter  trend  bounce   would  be  expected  but  was  not   forthcoming.  So  there's  even  it's  not   even  get  a  bounce.  It's  going  to  get  a   bounce  at  some  point  guys.  Uh  currently   there's  no  bounce  and  if  stocks  fall   stocks  look  a  bit  like  distribution.  I   mean,  when  you  look  at  the  um  look  at   the  stock  market,  this  we've  been  saying   for  weeks,  I  don't  like  that  it  cannot   make  alltime  high.  I  don't  like  that   it's  kind  of  losing  momentum.  It's  kind   of  like  it  was  right  here.  It's  kind  of   like,  let's  see,  did  we  have  examples   kind  of  like  it  was  right  right  here.  Uh   the  history  doesn't  have  to  repeat,  but   uh  it  it  is  a  bit  of  alarming.  It's  I   have  alarms  setting  off  when  I  see  this.   So,  we  may  easily  see  a  drop  here  10%   towards  the  50  week.  Okay?  And  uh   Bitcoin  will  not  like  it.  Okay,  it  will   not  like  it.  Absolutely  not.  So  uh  let's   see  what's  going  to  happen  here.  Willy   Willy  willywoo.  What  is  he  saying?  He's   saying  that  uh  I  have  bad  news  for  the   perma  bulls.  Bitcoin  is  still   strengthening  its  bare  trend.  Volatility   is  a  key  metric  used  by  quants  to  detect   trends.  Bitcoin  entered  its  bare  market   when  volatility  spiked  upwards  quickly.   Uh  volatility  then  continues  to  climb,   meaning  the  bare  trend  is  strengthening.   So  basically  saying  that,  you  know,   we're  here  now.  uh  he  was  I  mean  it's   it's  a  I  don't  know  how  you  trade  based   on  this  exactly  but  it's  it's  still   interesting  to  keep  an  keep  an  eye  on   that  at  some  point  the  volatility  is   going  to  reach  a  peak  and  that's   basically  the  end  the  of  of  of  the  of   the  bar  or  at least  super  close  because   whenever  we  had  the  peak  previously  it   was  quite  close  but  not  super  I  mean   sometimes  just  in  the  middle  of  the  bear   so  yeah  I  don't  know  how  much  weight  I   put  I  I  put  into  this  it's  just  I  just   use  it  for  sentiment  I  just  use  for   sentiment  there's  a  lot  of  bare   sentiment   So,  how  can  we  use  sentiment  to  our   advantage?  Just  knowing  the  plan  and  the   plan  is  that  we  slowly  slowly  buy  within   the  buy  zone.  It's  very  very  nice.   Sentiment  is  bad  here,  which  means  that   the  buy  zone  is  actually  a  buy  zone.   Okay,  sentiment  is  bad.  Willy  woo,   everyone  is  super  bare.  And  by  the  way,   we're  also  bare.  I  mean,  you  see  here  on   the  on  the  chart,  but  being  bare  and   accumulating,  nibbling  slowly  here  um  is   can  can  still  be  valid.  I  mean,  I  can  I   can  I  mean,  I  can  see  that  it's  good   value,  but  I  see  a  lot  of  retardios  that   are  still  going  to  sell  it.  So,  I  can   still  I  mean,  I  can  still  expect  more   downside,  but  uh  uh  hedge  hedge  the  risk   or  the  possibility  of  a  mega  pump  by   nibbling  a  bit.  I  mean,  I  I  know  many   people  they  get  irritated  when  I   position  myself  in  the  smartest  way   possible  by  being  good  no matter  what   happens.  I  mean  many  plebas  who  don't   understand  Marcus  they  want  me  to  pick  a   side  and  corner  myself.  So  there   sometimes  people  comment  oh  Ivan  so  you   make  it  so  easy  for  yourself  because  no   matter  what  you  cannot  be  wrong  and  I'm   like  that's  the  point  that's  the  point.   I  mean  they  mean  it  kind  of  like  a   criticism  you  know  Ivan  you  you   basically  cover  all  bases  so  your   analysis  cannot  be  man  I  mean  that   that's  the  point   that's  the  point  that's  the  point  we   position  ourselves  we  so  so  whatever   whatever  happens  we're  good  we're  good   now  I  understand  it's  a  big  mindset   shift  if  you've  been  allin  no  stop  loss   you  corner  yourself  and  you  want  to  find   some  influencers  or  someone  that  just   speaks  that  narrative  and  goes  with  the   ship  if  if  if  they're  wrong  We  don't   work  like  that.  Uh  we  work  a   professionally.  We  work  in  a  way  where   no  matter  what  happens,  we're  in  a   fantastic  fantastic  position.  So  I  hope   you  appreciate  that.  But  um  I  mean   here's  an  example.  Here's  an  example   where  we  are  I  mean  we  are  nibbling  here   slowly  within  the  buy  zone  but  we  still   expect  us  to  go  quite  deep  into  the  buy   zone.  Okay.  Uh  and  again  this  drawing  is   just  what  can  happen.  It's  not  a  it's   not  a  direct  prediction.  It  can  it  can   go  in  million  different  ways  but  this  is   what  my  brain  is  prepared  for.  Okay.  And   I  thought  it's  it's  useful  to  draw   because  when  I  say  the  buy  zone  is  still   useful  for  you  to  see  what  my  brain  is   still  prepared  for  that  yes  it's  cheap   everything  here  within  the  buy  zone  is   cheap  long  term  but  it  can  you  know   cheap  is  60  or  40k  like  it's  it's  both   of  them  are  cheap  but  one  is  cheaper   than  the  other  so  you  have  to  be   prepared  okay  it's  like  you  know  you   have  80%  discount  but  it  can  also  be  90%   discount.  Would  you  not  buy  something  at   80%  discount  knowing  that  maybe  it's   going  to  be  90?  Why  box  yourself  into   that   scenario?  Better  to  to  be  okay.  Don't  be   too  greedy.  So  anyway,  hope  that  makes   sense.  Let  me  know.  Now,  uh  guys,  there   is  some  shadiness  happening  with  the   treasury  companies.  That's  why  I  don't   like  treasury  companies,  guys.  I  don't   like  them.  I  don't  like  micro  strategy.   I  don't  like  any  of  them.  There  is  a  lot   of  corruption  going  on.  Micro  strategy   is  probably  the  best,  but  I  still  don't   like  it  because  I  don't  understand  it.  I   don't  understand  the  risk.  I  They  can   change  at  any  time.  Sailor  can  wake  up.   he  can  get  a  new  idea  to  change  it.  You   need  to  follow  along  with  it.  Uh  you  he   he  changes  it  a  lot  with  new  debt   instruments,  strikes,  strife,  like  every   day  there's  something  new  and  and  he's   still  kind  of  the  best  option.  If  you  if   you  want  to  have  a  treasury,  but  why  why   do  you  want  a  treasury  company?  I  I   really  don't  get  it.  Some  people  say,  \"I   want  more  return.\"  Okay,  if  you  want   more  return,  go  go  to   bullmay.com/partners   and  uh  sign  up  on  buy  bit.  You  get  a  big   signup  bonus.  So  instant  win  and  then   you  can  go  long,  you  can  go  short.  You   can  use  leverage  up  to  I  don't  know  how   many  hundreds  of  it's  a  lot  but  you   should  be  super  careful.  Uh  so  you  can   actually  do  things  properly  like  if  you   want  more  volatility  this  is  how  you  do   it.  This  is  how  you  get  more  volatility.   You're  fully  in  control.  This  is  how  you   get  more  volatility.  Why  buy  a  treasury   company  where  you  are  not  in  control?   You  don't  you  don't  know  what  else  is   happening.  But  I  digress.  It's  just  I   mean  it's  my  opinion.  I  really  don't   understand   how  people  are  buying  this  treasury   crap.  I  don't.  But  okay,  uh  maybe  it's   good,  maybe  you  love  it.  Good  for  you.   Here's  the  thing.  This  guy  David  Bailey   apparently  apparently  is  doing  a  lot  of   selfdeing  with  his  treasury  company.  So   he  has  this  Nakamoto  treasury  company.   That's  number  one.  Number  two,  he  also   has  two  other  companies  that  Nakamoto   treasury  company  purchased.  So  he  has   two  companies.  Then  he  has  this  public   company  for  Pleba  that  buy  the  stock.   And  with  a  public  company,  he  buys  his   own  to  other  companies  at  very  very   great  deal  uh  very  very  bad  very  very   bad  deal  for  the  buying  company  and  very   good  deal  for  the  selling  company.  So   the  buying  company  is  the  public  listed   company  with  a  lot  of  pleb  shareholder   and  the  selling  company  is  his  own   company  where  he's  the  shareholder   basically.  Okay.  So  this  what  happened.   You  can  read  more  what  happened  here  but   all  in  all  um  you  you  you  you  have  the   situation  where  uh  there's  a  lot  of  sell   dealing  and  uh  that  that's  why  you  know   buying  a  stock  this  is  an  example  of  the   management  risk  I  was  speaking  about   when  you  have  a  stock  there's  there's  a   dude  somewhere  there  is  a  dude  somewhere   a  hairy  dudes  in  some  cases  okay  and  uh   what  the  hell  he's  going  to  do  he's   going  to  wake  up  he's  going  to  buy  his   own  like  I  I  have  no  control  over  that   so  why  even  be  in  that  why  Why?  Why?   Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Why?  Anyway,  if  you   want,  you  can  um  you  can  read  more  in   depth.  So,  yeah.  Uh  they  have  a  big  loss   on  the  acquisition.  Well,  the  acquiring   company,  unrealized  loss  on  uh  in   digital  assets,  uh  and  so  on.  I  mean,  go   here  and  read,  go  here  and  read   everything  so  you  understand  what's   happening.  And  this  guy,  it  was  supposed   to  be  legit.  I  mean,  he's  kind  of  the   owner  of  uh  Bitcoin  magazine  and  so  on   so  forth.  Um  and  it  can  happen.  So  I   don't  want  to  track  any  of  this.  I  have   no  time  to  track  any  of  this  like  be   involved  in  company  drama  or  you  know   what  management  is  doing  what  the  dude   woke  up  you  know  scratched  his  [ __ ]  he   decided  to  buy  his  own  I  mean  you   understand  you  understand  this  is  the   problem  with  being  a  penny  stock  owner   okay  you  can  trade  penny  stock  if   they're  in  bull  trend  and  then  you're   out  stop  loss  you're  out  or  take  profit   you're  out  but  you  know  when  people  they   become  like  super  involved  they  become   part  of  the  journey  it's  not  for  me  guys   it's  it's  not  It's  not.  I'm  sorry.  It's   not  for  me.  There  are  many  different   ways.  If  you  want  volatility,  use   leverage.  Uh  with  mechanical  rules  is   great.  Uh  there  leverage  gets  a  bad  rep   because  most  people  don't  know  how  to   use  it.  They  don't  know  position  size   risk  calculation.  They  don't  know.  So   that's  that.  Uh  guys,  a  rumor,  rumor,   rumor.  I  don't  know  how  trustworthy  this   guy  is.  Probably  not  too  trustworthy.   But  listen  guys,  we  love  the  rumors.  We   love  the  drama.  So  even  if  there's  a   good  rumor  from  an  untrustworthy  guy   towards  the  end  of  the  show,  we  will   include  man.  It's  for  the  show  this  for   the  for  the  show.  Let's  see.  Maybe  maybe   it's  correct.  But  the  rumor  and  by  the   way  guys,  the  reason  why  I'm  including   it  is  because  to  me  it  makes  perfect   business  sense.  B  chain  is  a  bit  of  a   fugazi.  It  doesn't  make  too  much  money   for  them.  They  cannot  really  compete   with  Sana.  It's  just  distraction.  They   kind  of  have  to  prioritize  it  because  it   is  their  chain.  But  it  doesn't  make  any   business  sense.  It  cost  them,  it  cost   base  cost  of  Coinbase  billions  and   billions  and  billions  and  billions  and   billions  and  billions  and  billions  of   dollars  in  lost  users  and  revenue   because  they  did  not  integrate  Sana   early  enough.  Instead,  they  integrate   their  base  poo  poo  chain  that  no  one   uses  because  it's  corporate  chain  and  uh   they  missed  out  on  all  the  Sana  meme   volume  and  of  course  base  is  too   institution  is  too  you  know  it's  too   clean  to  do  any  memes.  So  they  didn't   embrace  the  the  indigenous  for  over  a   year  probably  like  2020  I'm  think  2023   2024  like  did  they  have  the  they  they   fumbled  probably  two  years  uh  where  all   of  the  memes  were  doing  so  much  revenue.   So  look  here  rumor  is  that  Coinbase  is   shutting  base  down.  It  would  make   perfect  business  sense.  I  mean  to  be   fair.  Top  apps  already  leaving.  Uh   someone  says  oh  big  what's  up  Zora   launched  on  Solana.  Yeah  I  mean  good  for   them.  Good  for  them.  Uh,  I  don't  know   why  you  would  stay  on  base.  I  mean,  it's   a  corporate  chain.  They  cannot  embrace   all  of  the  crazy  stuff  because  it's   unethical.  It's  immoral.  This  and  that.   But  that's  the  what  the  users  want.  I   mean,  listen,  the  users  are  not  victims.   Some  people  are  saying  that  you  know  the   meme  creators,  they're  they're  like,  you   know,  this  savages.  They  are  they  are   abusing  and  fleecing  the  retail  investor   when  it  comes  to  meme.  But  guys,  the   retail  investor  loves  meme.  They  love   it.  They  love  speculation.  They  want  to   get  rich  quick.  They  love  it.  So  there   is  a  demand  and  then  there  is  a  market   and  you  have  product  market  fit.  Okay.   Okay.  So  the  user  without  the  user  there   would  be  no  craziness.  The  user  loves   craziness  and  there  is  a  solution  for   that  and  there  is  product  market  fit.   Obviously  great  product  market  fit.  So   don't  say  that  you  know  someone  is  like   abusing.  The  users  are  freaking  visions   themselves.  They  love  it.  That's  why  we   have  chain  onchain.  Okay.  So  we  can   express  our  desire,  our  deepest  desire   to  go  nuts  and  dig.  Okay?  But  coin  is   they're  too  clean  for  that.  They're  too   clean  for  that.  Instead,  they  did  all  of   the  bad  ideas  with  uh  minting  your  tweet   and  other  things  that  no  one  cares  that   there  is  actually  no  product  fit,  but   sounded  good  maybe  in  their  investor   pitch  deck  or  whatever.  And  they   destroyed  Coinbase  wallet.  They  fully   destroyed  it  by  by  making  it  about  news.   You  open  Coinbase  wallet.  I  can  I  can   barely  understand  how  my  where  my  asset   is,  but  I  see  all  the  crypto  news.  I  see   all  of  the  minted  NF  minted  tweet  and  so   on.  But  anyway,  so  top  apps  are  leaving.   Zora  gone  to  Sena  for example.  Oh,  what   you  said  here.  Okay.  No  token  coming.  Uh   betting  odds  on  a  base  token  in6  gets   smashed.  Armstrong  endlessly  dumping   coin  stock  sinking  ship  base  sequencer   gets  turned  off  any  day.  There  you  go.   There  you  go.  Now,  is  this  guy   trustworthy?  If  we  were  to  look  at  the   source,  if  you've  got  if  you've  gone  to   journalism  school,  which  I  haven't  gone,   but  still  we  have  a  show  here.   Apparently,  it  was  not  needed,  you  know,   to  always  check  the  source.  You   understand?  Is  it  the  firstand  source,   secondhand?  Which  source?  This  guy  is   maybe  80  fifthand  source  like  it's  not   it's  not  the  best  source  in  the  world,   but  it's  what  we  work  with,  guys.  It's   what  we  work  with.   It's  what  we  work  with.  Now  guys  uh  look   here  Dutch  Dutch  if  you  are  from  Dutch   if  you  are  from  Netherland   uh  be  careful  we've  told  you  to  go  away   these  guys  are  coming  for  your  money   very  very  hard  they  have  to  pay  uh  for  a   lot  of  dudes  that  have  arrived  you  know   which  dudes  these  dudes  they  need   apartment  okay  and  you  pay  you  pay  you   and  you  be  quiet  if  you  say  something   you  go  to  jail  literally   you  you  go  to  jail  for  uh  for  racism  or   something  else.  So  any  all  of  the  dudes   are  coming.  They're  coming  and  coming  in   waves.  They  need  your  apartment  quickly.   They  need  food  quickly.  You  pay  with  36%   gain  on  unre  uh  36%  tax  on  unrealized   gain.  Very  very  quickly  quickly  and  you   you're  quiet.  You're  quiet  and  you're   solidar.  Okay?  Otherwise  jail.  So  look   here.  Apparently  this  woman  who   introduced  the  tax  she  has  no  uh   education.  She's  uneducated  player.   Basically,   he  she  has  unrealized  credentials.  Do   you  say  that?  Unrealized  credentials.  Or   maybe  it's  a  joke,  you  know.  Unrealized   again.  Unreal  credential.  See,  she   basically  had  no  university  education.   She  only  had  high  school.  That's  it.   That's  it.  Matt  asked,  \"Is  this  true?\"   And  Guzman  confirms  we  have  firsthand   source  here  just  like  our  journalism   ethics  requires.  So  from  Guzman  on  the   ground  in  Netherlands,  yes,  she   resigned.  She  never  finished  any   official  education  except  for  her  high   school.  Now  she  has  left  politics   completely.  I  would  not  be  surprised  if   we  find  her  on  on  only  fan  next.   That's  from  our  firstand  source  over  in   Netherlands.  Thanks  a  lot,  Guzma.  So   guys,  it's  crazy.  It's  crazy.  It's   crazy.  Uh  DEI  exactly  thankfully  DEI  age   is  coming  to  an  end  but  guys  the  dudes   they  still  need  apartment  and  food  and   you  pay  and  you're  quiet  and  you're   solidarity.  Okay.  If  you  speak  against   it  uh  straight  to  jail.  Okay.  So  yes  DEI   may  be  over  as  a  as  a  thing  but  the   taxes  are  are  only  going  up.  Okay.  So   either  you're  smart  and  you  move  quick   or  you  are  the  last  to  leave  and  that's   when  you  are  in  a  worse  position.  Why?   because  you  are  uh  going  to  be  locked  in   with  Berlin  wall,  financial  Berlin  wall,   maybe  even  physical  Berlin  wall  at  some   point.  Maybe  it's  going  to  even  get   physical.  I  mean,  who  the  hell  knows  if   people  are  leaving.  It's  it's  a  big   problem.  So,  if  I  would  be  the  ruler,  I   would  be  socialist  like  I  told  you  in   yesterday's  stream  because  it's  one   person,  one  vote.  It's  better  to  take   money  from  one  guy,  give  it  to  a   thousand  guys.  You  lose  one  vote,  but   you  get  a  thousand.  So,  it's  simple   math.  And  then,  of  course,  uh  exit  tax,   maybe  physical  Berlin  wall.  We're  going   to  make  it  great.  We're  going  to  make  it   great  solidarity  euphoria.  Okay.  And   then  we  have  even  more  dudes  entering   because  they're  going  to  vote  for  me   obviously  because  I  will  take  this  this   dude  might  like  your  moneyman.  I'm  going   to  take  your  money.  If  you  are  in  in   still  in  that  we  take  your  money  and   we're  going  to  give  it  to  all  of  of  my   new  guys.  We're  going  to  vote  for  me.   We're  going  to  be  great.  Like  it's  going   to  be  great.  We're  going  to  have  a  70   plus%  uh  votes.   It's  simple  guys.  It's  simple.  But  some   people  no  I  know  it's  conspiracy  man.  Do   you  mean  it's  simple  math  man?  I  even  I   also  don't  blame  them.  Like  listen,  it's   a  simple  thing.  They  they  want  vote.   That's  how  you  get  it.  I  would  do  the   same,  man.  I  would  do  the  same.  Uh   that's  how  you  get  like  what  do  you  we   need  to  max  as  political  party.  We  need   to  maximize  vote.  How  we  maximize  vote?   This  is  how  you  do  it.  It's  simple.  It's   simple.  Why  is  it  even  controversial?   One  vote,  one  person.  That's  it.  That's   it.  That's  it,  guys.  That's  it.  Super   simple.  US  offering  asylum.  Yeah.  I   mean,  they  should  do  that.  They  should   do  that.  They  So,  so  people  can  flee  to   the  US.  That  that  would  be  great   actually.   Guys,  listen.  That's  it.  That's  it.  Hope   you  enjoyed.  Hope  you  hope  you  learned   something.  Let's  go  to  Q&A  questions,   answers,  debates,  discussions,  and  uh   let's  talk  about  it.  Let's  talk  about   everything.  As  always,  number  one,   uh  go  where?  Go  to  bullmay.com  to  watch   the  free  training.  So,  you  get  the   mechanical  rules.  You  go  from  uneducated   play  hoping  and  praying  to  a   professional  investor  who  is  in  control   of  the  destiny.  Very  important.  You  need   to  know  mechanical  rules.  So  you  can  for   example  short  without  mechanical  rules.   I  understand  you  cannot  short  because   you  don't  know  how  it  works.  You  get  uh   wrecked.  Uh  and  you  can  long  also   properly.  Um  so  if  you  don't  have   mechanical  rules,  you  go  to  like  micro   strategy,  you  get  wrecked  there.  Or  you   go  to  this  Nakamoto  David  Bailey,  you   get  wrecked  there.  Okay,  so  that's  that   guys.  That's  that.

Which   one  I  should  get?  Uh  I  I  can  check  in   the  book  here.  I  I'm  thinking  what  my   next  watch  should  be,  guys.  I  I  still   need  to  do  a  video  about  this  one.  But   I'm  thinking  uh  yeah  I'm  I'm  becoming   slightly  addicted  to  it  because  I  mean  I   I  need  to  give  props  to  the  watch  in   like  I  really  love  how  they  created  this   like  ecosystem  you  collect  there  are   like  YouTube  channels  about  it  I  get   like  five  videos  per  day  about  watches   like  it  is  interesting  before  before  I   had  it  before  I  had  it  I  didn't  like  I   was  like  to  totally  outside  I  didn't   really  understand  it   um  and  uh  once  you  you  know  you  get  into   it  it's  I  like  it  I  like  it  I  like  it   because  at  the  end  of  the  today.  What  I   mean  there's  not  too  much  to  like  what   what  what  is  there  to  buy?  So  you  you   can  get  an  interest  in  watches.  Okay.   Land  dweller  too  small  Rolex.  Yeah,   maybe  Landwell  dweller.  Uh  I'll  check   it.   Uh  so  there  we  go.   Leather  bound  literature.  Exactly.   The  problem  with  watches  are  the   freaking  names.  Well,  yeah,  but  it's  not   that  hard.  I  at  first  I  also  thought   there  so  many  names  but  you  know  I  mean   you  do  learn  it  fast  man  it's  like  in   Runescape  you  have  the  party  hat  you   have  all  kinds  of  other  items  so  once   you  are  in  this  item  you  you  you  you  get   once  you  are  in  the  in in  the  loop  so  to   speak  you  you  get  used  to  it  now  guys   there  is  something  I  really  like   speaking  about  run  escape  uh  for  claude   I  have  you  guys  tried  it  I  I  need  to  I   need  to  figure  out  how  to  get  the  sound   installed  for  my  claude  here  look  here   >> SCV  good  to  go  sir   By  the  way,  this  guy  says  Warcraft  3,   but  isn't  it  Starcraft?  I  haven't  played   Warcraft.  Uh,  I  haven't  played  Warcraft   a  lot.  Just  when  I  was  like  super  super   small,  but  I  played  mainly  Starcraft,  so   it  sounds  to  me  like  Starcraft,  but  look   here.  Go,   >> sir.   >> But  it's  also  Starcraft  one.  This   Starcraft  one  sound.   >> SCV.  Good  to  go,  sir.   Ah,  and  now  he  changes  it  to  Warcraft.   >> Right  away,  sir.   >> Work  complete.   >> Okay,  now  it's  work.  Okay,   >> work.  Work.   >> Work.  Work.   >> I  need  this.  I  need  this.   >> Job's  done.   >> I  need  this.   I  need  I  need  it.  I  need  it.  I  need  it.   I  need  it.  I  need  it.  ASAP.  ASAP.   Sea  Dweller  one.  Okay,  let's  check  it.   Let's  check  it.   I  think  I  want  some.  So,  I  have  this   gold  one.  I  think  I  want  something   that's  not  gold.  Uh  I  want  more.   Oh,  yeah.  May  maybe  something  like  this.   Yeah.  Yeah,  exactly.  Maybe  something   like  this.   Exactly.  Exactly.  Actually,  yeah,  maybe   something  like  this.  Yeah.   Something  that  uh  is  less  uh  that  that   doesn't  scream  at  you  because  this  one   is  great  for  I  mean  I  love  having  it  on   the  show.  Like  it's  really  nice  for  the   show.  This  one  I  love  like  how  it  like   blends  with  the  back.  Like  it's   fantastic.  Like  this  gold  one  for  the   show  is  top  top  top  top top.  That  being   said,  I  don't  want  to  go  ever  with  it.   So  maybe  something  like  this.  Yeah,   maybe  something  like  this.  That's  true.   Rolex  is  lame.  The  watch  brand  for   people  who  don't  don't  actually  like   watches.  Lol.  Well,  I  mean,  the  thing  is   you  don't  have  to  choose.  I'm  I'm  open   to  Pekk.  I'm  open  to  everything.  Like   I'm  not  this.  No,  either  this  or  that.  I   mean,  you  can  have  both.  That's  also  the   great  thing  with  Bullmania.  Once  you   have  profit  in  the  portfolio,  you  don't   have  to  pick.  Yeah,  you  can  have  both.   You  can  have  Role,  you  can  have  Patek,   uh  you  can  have  Vasheron,  Constantine,   you  can  have  anything,  man.  You  can  have   anything.  So  don't  don't  have  this   mindset.  Oh,  you  know,  I  you're  Rolex,   so  you're  not  Man,  I'm  everything  just   like  in  trades.  I'm  not  I'm  not   cornering  myself  in  in  watches  also.  You   know,  you  can  have  a  bit  of  you  can  have   a  bit  of  Pekk,  you  can  have  a  bit  of   Richard  Mill  as  well.  So  I  I  just  need   to  figure  out  the  next  step.  But  I  don't   like  this.  Oh  no,  you  you  have  this.  I   don't  like  Listen,  what  is  this?  You  can   have  both.  There  is  uh  there's  abundance   guys.  They  print  trillions  of  dollars.   You  can  have  abundance.  Abundance  in   life.  You  invite  it  in  your  in  your   life.  And  you  also  invite  the  pump  in   your  life.   I  remember  the  days  when  Ivan  Hayden.   Yeah.  I  mean  guys,  I  was  like  2017.  I   was  like  5  years  old.   I  was  like  5  years  old.  This  this  one   example  where  people  like  they  remember   Ivan  in  2017  you  didn't  like  guys.  Look   look  at  me  in  2017.  I  was  5  years  old  in   2017.  What  do  you  want?   What  do  you  want?  What what  do  you  want?   It's  uh  it's  different.  Exactly.  But   like  you  say,  all  respect  to  you,  I  also   had  a  Exactly.  Exactly.  Exactly.   Exactly.   I  think  you  know  after  a  few  wreckages,   so  what  changed  my  mind?  What  changed  my   mind?  Uh  in  especially  in  2018,  guys,   the  old  coins,  I  mean,  they  got  so   slaughtered.  It  was  crazy.  So  that's   where  like  I  kind  of  I  I  saw  my   portfolio.  I  was  like,  man,  why  didn't  I   spend  something,  you  know,  because  it   all  just  becomes  numbers  and  when  the   numbers  are  high,  you're  like,  man,  what   what  the  hell?  Why?  Like  just  buying   something  nice  it  and  I  would  at least   have  something,  you  know,  just  buying   something  nice  instead  of  like  holding   down  the  altcoin  99%.  So  it  kind  of  put   things  into  perspective  that  I  mean  your   portfolio  can  just  be  a  number  on  the   screen  because  before  like  in  2017  times   I  was  like  just  reinvest  as  soon  as   money  reinvest  okay  you  reinvest  okay   you  reinvest  okay  okay  for  what  like  for   what  you  need  to  enjoy  it  also  maybe  you   need  to  do  like  7030  uh  70%  reinvest  30%   enjoy  because  uh  once  the  bearer  comes   and  especially  if  you  don't  have   bulmania  you  see  the  losses  you're  like   man  what  is  this  it's  crazy  I  should   have  spent  a   should  have  spent  a  bit.   Well,   I  remember  Ivan  when  he  was  playing  with   Ninja  Turtle  figurines.   Exactly.  It's  like  when  people  say,   \"Ivan,  I  I  I  watched  you  since  2014.\"   Bro,  the  channel  started  in  2017.  How   you  watch  2014?  Ivan,  I'm  a  true  fan.  I   watched  since  2013.   Look  at  how  many  watches  Rolex  pumps  out   a  year.  compared  to  brands.  Yeah,   exactly.  So,  so  Rolex  does  like  over  a   million  as  far  as  I  know.  I  don't  know   how  much  Vashiron  does.  And  uh  yeah,  let   me  know  how  many  they  do.  And  how  much   does  the  uh  Richard  Mill  is  like  5,000  a   year  or  something  like  that?  But  yeah,  I   know.  I  know.  But  the  thing  is  when  it   comes  to  Rolex,  they  make  it  they  make   artificial  scarcity.  So  yeah,  it's  a  lot   of  Rolexes.  Yes.  But  uh  their  job  is  to   make  it  artificially  scarce  and  they're   doing  quite  a  good  job  for  that.  And  uh   but  yeah,  for  sure  I  mean  Rolex  is  the   most  you  can  you  can  think  of  Rolex  as   you  know  uh  kind  of  like  u  BTC  uh  of   watches  because  it's  the  most  liquid.  So   if  you  want  to  ever  sell  it,  you  will  be   able  to.  Uh  it's  everyone  wants  it.  Like   it's  uh  the  most  liquid,  the  you  know,   deepest  depth  in  the  market,  deepest   depth  and  and  um  yeah,  but  then  of   course  if  you  if  you're  more  of  a  no   fine  watch  collector,  fine  fine   collector,  then  uh  you  maybe  don't  care   about  that.  Uh  and  it's  fine.  It's  fine.   It's  fine.  You  can  have  both.   Also,  I  love  it  like  just  because  this   is  kind  of  like  my  my  first  watch.  I   love  it  because  it's  freaking  gold.  So,   when  I  look  at  the  gold  chart,  I  kind  of   see  see  it  there  as  well.  Uh,  if  you  if   you're  more  of  a  fine  collector,  maybe   you  don't  care  that  it's,  you  know,  it's   it's  it's  a  lot  of  freaking  gold   because  I  I  I  liked  it  that  it's  gold.   So,  it's  I  mean,  at least  it's  gold   there,  you  know,  because,  you  know,  when   you  buy  it  at  first,  you  don't  know  like   will  I  wear  it  one  day  and  then  I  will   never  care  about  it.  uh  like  do  I  really   want  it  or  I  because  you  you  you  never   know  until  you  try.  Like  there  are  many   things  you  buy  and  then  you're  like  what   the  hell  I  thought  I  wanted  it  I  don't   want.  So  when  I  bought  this  one  I  also   thought  like  will  I  really  want  it  or  I   just  wear  it  one  day  and  then  I  put  it   and  never  touch  it.  So  at  least  it's   gold.  At least  it's  gold.  You  know   there's  some  you  know  some some   fundamental   but  as  you  progress  in  your  in  in  being   a  more  of  a  fine  watch  collector  where   you  you  appreciate  the  finer  things  in   life  obviously  the  resale  value  matters   less.   Uh,  I  look  at  the  Rolex  Day  Date  Onyx   vintage  end  game.  What  the  hell?  Let  me   check.  Uh,  when  it  comes  to  Day  Date,  as   far  as  I  know,  they  don't  make  it  uh   like  uh  what  is  the  biggest  one?  40  uh   40  mm.  I  I  need  those  that  have  a  bit   bigger.   Oh,  yeah.  This  one  look  This  one  looks   very  nice.   This  one  looks  very  very  nice.   Fantastic.  Fantastic.   So,  you  have  it  or  or  it's  your  your   dream,  your  wet  dream,  so  to  speak.   Why  it's  not  in?  Let  me  see.  Let  me  see   on  Chrono.  End  game.  Vintage  end  game.   Let  me  just  see  here.   Okay.  But  but  it's  not  like  super   limited  edition.  I  guess  it's  like  50   60k.  Yeah,  that's  that  guys.  Uh,   everyone,  all  the  nonwatch  guys  are   tuning  out.  Let's  get  back  into  crypto.   And  but  yeah,  that's  that   AP.  Exactly.  Maybe  I  need  Royal  Oak.  So,   it's  a  big  fat  one.   But  for  the  next  one,  I  need  to  find   something  that's  not  like  too  screamy,   but  still  nice  and  uh  fantastic.   Oh,  I  I  know  Chaikin.  I  know  Chaiken.   The  Kalabok.   May  that's  the  one  I  should  get.  Yeah,   he's  getting  quite  famous  lately.  the   calabok  guy.   Yes,  I  think  I  need  something  like  that.   Yeah,  exactly.  I  need  something  like   that.  Something  that's  not  screaming  too   much.  Okay.   Exactly.  Thanks  for  linking  it.  It  is   32.  It  is  uh  uh  but  I  will  not  have  it   on  the  show.  On  the  show,  we  have  this   gold,  you  know.  I'm  here  for  the  tank.   All  gold.   This  is  more  for  every  day.  Exactly.   Exactly.  On  the  show,  we're  all  go.   We're  here  for  the  tank.   But  for  every  day,  this  one  maybe  is   good.  Okay.   And  then  yeah,  let  me  let  me  just  bring   up  Constantine  Chikid.   I  I  like  I  like  this  one.  I  mean,  the   probably  zero  resale  value  to  be  fair.   Probably  not  I  mean  not  too  liquid   market,  but  uh  it's  cool.  Like  he  has   this  unique  ones.  Uh  I  I  will  not  buy  it   yet.  Uh  but  I  I  have  it  in  my  radar.

And  then  he  did   Calabok  2.  And  maybe  I  should  buy  like   just  this  one  should  to  put  in  the   background  for  more  gold.  Easter  of   church  of  Christ.  Exactly.  Maybe  we  need   something  like  this  to  spread  Christian   values  across  the  world.  Very  important.   Uh  yeah,  that's  that  guys.  That's  that.   Where  is  the  Club  2?  Club  one.  Somewhere   he  has  a  second  one  somewhere.  And  this   one.  interesting  concept.  Yeah,  this  one   is  very  interesting  concept.   This  one  is  actually   very  interesting.   Yeah,  let's  preserve  our  familyfriendly   uh  rating.  But  is  there   maybe  some  Russian  with   potato  washer?  Exactly.  Guys,  listen.   That's  it.  That's  it.  That's  it.  Thanks   a  lot  for  being  here.  Thanks  a  lot  for   contributing  to  the  show.  SAS  apocalypse   basically  means  that  people  are  afraid   that  SAS  companies  are  going  to  die  like   the  Salesforce  into  it  and  everything.   Uh  and  just  rewatched  the  stream  but  you   watched  it.  So  SAS  apocalypse  means  that   people  think  that  everything  is  going  to   get  replaced.  I  I  don't  think  so  guys   number  one  as  a  fine  educated  computer   scientist  I  can  tell  you  that  it  won't   happen  like  the  the  vibe  and  also   someone  who  practices  vibe  coding  every   day  as  a  experienced  fine  vibe  coder   every  day  I  can  tell  you  that  uh  yes   it's  faster  to  build  but  that's  just   like  the  20%  of  the  job  guys  is  to  build   the  solution  70%  is  to  polish  it  make   production  ready  make  it  uh  24/7  make  it   super  reliable   make  it  secure.  Like  all  of  the  other   crap  that  people  think  ah  you  know   that's  the  10%  actually  70%.  Like  to  get   something  to  work  where  where  it  kind  of   does  the  job  that's  like  in  in  today's   age  where  you  need  reliability  you  use   it  in  you  know  production  grade   environments  actually  making  the   freaking  thing  work  is  like  30%.  You  can   you  that  you  can  vibe  code  but  that's   not  what  people  pay  for.  People  pay  for   that  it  works  every  day.  There  is   someone  that  will  answer  the  phone  if  it   doesn't  work.  You  don't  need  to  have  a   freaking  intern  that  bip  codes  it  and   you  need  to  and  that  needs  freaking   vacation  and  he  needs  the  healthy  like   he  needs  all  of  the  employee  guy  man   he's  employee  rather  pay  a  subscription   to  a  SAS  that  will  do  it  I  think  we're   kind  of  rediscovering  it  man  it's  nice   to  pay  subscription  than  to  have  a  staff   that  vibe  codes  and  manage  the  vibe   coding  but  so  SAS  apocalypse  I  think   it's  a  very  low  chance  of  it  really  you   removing  a  lot  of  the  SAS  company.  It's   not  going  to  happen.  Instead,  I  it's   very  bullish  for  them  because  they  can   improve  their  products  and  iterate  on   their  products  with  AI.  AI  makes  it   easier  to  iterate.  They  can  remove  a   bunch  of  stuff  and  they  can  have  shorter   iteration  cycle.  They  can  go  quicker   from  idea  to  to  implementation  skipping   a  bunch  of  like  middle  steps  where  you   know  people  discuss  because  anyone  can   now  build  a  working  prototype.  So  SAS   pockets  will  not  happen  because  the  vibe   causing  is  mainly  for  prototyping.  Okay,   it's  mainly  and  that's  a  lot  of  value  to   the  SAS  companies  to  become  even  better.   So  that's  my  view.  There  are  of  course   some  uh  I  mean  some  uh  things  that  are   easier  to  do  like  the  the  full   bullmania.com  is  vibecoded  and  all  like   all  of  these  char  like  this  one  it  was   vibecoded.  Let's  say  you  are   Squarespace.  maybe  you  you  you're  going   to  have  some  issues  if  you're   Squarespace  because  uh  it  was  easier  to   just  tell  AI  to  to  vibe  code  like  all  of   this  like  all  of  this  guys  all  the  chart   is  all  vibe  coded  but  that  being  said   like  just  you  know  operating  this   website  which  which  I  just  vibe  coded  it   it  took  like  10  days  to  vibe  code  like   get  all  the  data  all  the  back  end  like   uh  you  know  it's  quite  nice  but  just   operate  I  see  sometimes  I  have  to  tweak   it  sometimes  uh  you  know  there  are  some   issues  here  and  there  so  if  it  was   wasn't  this  like  small  small  scope  uh  it   would  be  yeah  I  mean  it  can  easily   spiral  into  a  full-time  job  just  to  like   uh  monitor  that  everything  is  okay  um  so   I  I  I  can  see  the  limitations  already  of   it  okay  so  that's  that  guys  okay  thanks   a  lot  smash  up  the  like  subscribe  and   goodbye  guys  goodbye  goodbye  goodbye  I",
