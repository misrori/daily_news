        "transcript": "Right guys, I've got a big one for you today. Kathy Wood has just sat down and laid out exactly why she's positioned Arc in the way she has and her answer on Nvidia might surprise you. She gives her up-to-ate take on Tesla, her take on the GPU to AS6 shift. And then we have a bonus clip from her at the end where she says which stocks she's focusing on now. And then in clip number two, we have Sadia Nadella, Microsoft CEO, who's describing Microsoft's vision for AI in the workplace. And I think it tells us something important about where the real money is going in this AI cycle. The tech we're on the cusp of is profound. You know, it sounds to me like you're suggesting that you think that several of the hyperscalers are simply spending too much and that the return on that invested capital is going to be lower than maybe some investors think. Now, if they are spending too much, they're spending it on chips from Nvidia, which you have a much smaller position today than you had just a few years ago. Do you regret selling as much of Nvidia as you did, which by most accounts cost you more than a billion dollars? >> So, that's taking a look at uh what that sale did, all other things equal. But what did we put uh that that cash into? Uh we put it into companies like Palunteer, which I think since that time has done better than Nvidia, like Coinbase, which was under SEC attack at the time, very opportunistic. Uh and so was it even Stephen? I don't I don't know. Probably not 100%. But I think we landed on some of the names that were really going to take off uh based on again uh what the new news was going to be. Um and we do think if you look at our big ideas uh you'll see one section where we show uh that GPUs generally are going to come up against the uh competition more competition in and of themselves. We we're seeing the hyperscalers uh uh moving towards uh developing their own chips. We're seeing more specialized chips. Uh certainly Tesla is moving in that direction and we think AS6 are going to take share from uh GPUs. Uh so you know I I don't regret it. You'll see in our top 10 in ARK out of recognition that we believe this AI cycle is still in early days. uh AMD is in our top 10 and of course the shocking thing there is it's it's uh it's doing very well in GPUs especially for small language models relative to Nvidia that is uh not as well in large language models but the shocking thing there also is that um it's taken huge share from Intel up to 40% of the CPU market right now uh which you know I grew up as it was fighting for 10 15% And then the other thing with AMD is uh much less memory required uh with AMD's chips just the way uh they've constructed them. So again there are lots of puts and takes here. >> Yeah. Uh Broadcom too, right? You like Broadcom today more than Nvidia. Is that is that fair to say? >> Well, Broadcom is a smaller position in the portfolio and you're right. We've started building it. uh and it is because it will probably be one of the prime beneficiaries of the shift from GPUs to A6. Now over time I have steered away from Broadcom because it has been a consolidator. Uh I'm not as an investor personally uh not attracted to growth by acquisition and and Broadcom has been acquisition prone. Uh we do think though that the the ASIC world is going to grow fast enough where it won't need to make acquisitions in the future. >> Tesla is your largest holding uh 10% waiting. The stock's done nothing over the past 12 months. Why? >> Well, I do think there's a bit of a tugof-war between the bulls and the bears. That's always the case. Uh it has been if you look at it from a basing point of view, it's been in a base uh very it's a a wide base but for about five years and I remember I think it was on your show Scott one time I made the uh point that wow this has been a very long base. I think back then it was six years. Uh now we've had five years. We're at the top near the top of that range and we do think robo taxis are going to break it out. Uh we think that as more analysts uh do the modeling and see that we're now talking about a company uh with 15% gross margins but robo taxis recurring revenue model software as a service kind of model 85% margins for that kind of business. uh we think that more and more analysts are going to understand how profound this model is going to change. >> So ARC's portfolio moves reveals a thesis that the AI investment cycle is shifting from infrastructure build out to the application layer companies that actually generate the returns. So Kathy's being pretty direct here about why she trimmed Nvidia and rotated into names like Coinbase and Palanteer. And I think the reasoning is sound even if you could argue with the timing. The hyperscalers are building their own chips. Google's been doing it for years with TPUs and Amazon has Terranium. And if all this jargon on what the different chips are, TPUs, A6, Amazon's Terranium, I break this all down in the AI course I made thinking about myself before I knew anything on AI. So, it's basically the course I wish I had when I first started researching into AI. And it covers all this stuff. If you join now, you get lifetime access, and the price only goes up as we add new modules, which we're thinking of doing soon. Microsoft's also working on chips, and Tesla's also got their own silicon for inference. When you're running models at massive scale, the economics of custom A6 starts to look really compelling compared to general purpose GPUs. That's why Kathy likes Brocom here. There, the picks and shovels play for the custom chip buildout. But the Tesla call is where I think Kathy is most differentiated from other institutional investors. She's talking about a 15% gross margin car business transforming into a 70 80 85% gross margin robo taxi software business which isn't a small shift in a business model. It changes how you have to value the entire company. And she's right that most analysts still haven't done the math on what recurring revenue autonomy looks like. Dan Knives has been beating this drum for months, calling for a 70 to 75% global robo taxi market share and institutional skepticism is still pretty high. I was getting a little bit of deja vu when Kathy was talking about the stock. She's framing around base building. Tesla's been rangebound, which basically means the stock has hardly moved. It's just been up and down in a sideways motion for years. And Kathy's essentially saying the stock is coiled, waiting for a big catalyst. That catalyst is unsupervised autonomy at scale. We've seen the videos from Austin, cars driving with nobody in them. The question isn't whether the technology works anymore. The question is how fast it scales and whether regulators can keep up. Texas is letting Tesla move fast. California a little bit here, but Europe, we're way slower. It's rather embarrassing. But once you prove it works in one market, the regulatory dominoes tend to fall. The broader point Kathy's making about the AI cycle is that we're moving from who has the best chips to who has the best applications. Nvidia is going to do fine selling to everyone who's building AI, but the outsized returns might come from the companies that actually deploy AI in ways that generate cash flow. Tesla, genomics companies, robotics plays. That's where ARC is placing its best. You can agree or disagree with the specific names, but the theory is that applications eventually matter more than infrastructure and that has historically been correct in tech cycles. And that brings us to how the enterprise side is thinking about deploying all this AI. Microsoft CEO Salar Nadella sat down with the all-in crew and explained Microsoft's vision for how knowledge workers actually will be using AI. Not chatbots, not co-pilots, but something more fundamental. And I think what he's describing is a template for how the next trillion dollars of AI value gets created. >> In my estimation, three modalities for knowledge workers. Elon's building at XAI what they're calling a human emulator. If you saw that leak this week, yeah. Uh where they're just building employees and just putting them into their chat rooms and email. Then you have Claude came out with Co-work this week. Incredibly powerful. People are kind of losing their minds over it. I've been playing with it for the last 40 hours. Truly impressive. What's your vision for Microsoft and how knowledge workers will actually put this to use because there seems to be a gap between you know playing around with chat GBT and getting some interesting results and getting business results. >> Yeah. So I think it one of the most perhaps illustrative examples um of trying to understand these various form factors is looking at coding which is obviously a form of knowledge work or uh probably the best example of knowledge work and if you think about the journey coding has been it started with u essentially uh uh the next edit suggest right that was the first time in fact my own belief in this entire uh generation of tech really sort of got formulated where I started seeing I think it was G you know there's a codeex model back in the day it was preGPT35 uh that's when next edits started working with some real accuracy then we went to chat then we went to actions and now to full autonomous agents and then the autonomous agents can be both foreground background in the cloud or local right so that's all the form factors that exist today when you're coding and interestingly You know, if you look at it, you use all of them, right? It's not like there's only one form factor. So that's I think probably one of the other lessons. So for example, when I'm in a CLI, I can you go a foreground agent, background agent, and then just literally go edit in VS Code right there. All happening in parallel, right? So that sort of shows how these form factors even composed. So then you bring that to knowledge work to your point. We started with chat. chat with reasoning sort of goes beyond just request response because you now have that chain of thought uh where you can see it work. Now they're actions right essentially either through computer use or through uh a you know basically skills uh and agent calls so you can do actions. So that's kind of the state of the copilot today. Now there is a way to think about you know the theory of the mind evolution right because you need like if you remember you know Jobs had the best line I would say for PCs or computers was to say if you it's a bicycle for the mind uh Bill had a line which I liked as well which was it's information at your fingertips. We kind of need now a new concept metaphor for how we use computers in the AI age. you have one >> and the one I like actually came from the CEO of notion which I you know that manager of >> incredible product >> you haven't bought it yet >> I've not bought that uh but the it's both management of you know basically a manager of infinite minds that's a nice way to think about it right when you sort of really look at all the agents that you are working with you kind of need to understand what I in fact the other term I like is we macro delegate and micro steer in fact you kind of need that in in in coding you kind of have it right so you do a macro delegation and then I can in parallel give it instructions while it is doing work so that's sort of the state even today of co-pilot or what have you bring up a little bit of one of one of the form factors I'm very excited about and you'll see us even in the next week even uh do things is while I'm sitting in GitHub copilot what it's not as if software developers sit in isol ation, right? It's not like the only thing I work on is my repo. I attend meetings. Um, I write specs or others have written specs that I'm implementing. Uh, I need to have my repo be consistent with that. So, that means using either a straightforward MCP server or a scale. I want to be able to call into my work IQ, which is the copilot, bring that in. That's the type of composition uh of knowledge work that will happen. Same thing with security. Say you're a security professional, you have lots of logs. Uh how do you sort of really analyze them? You drop them into a file system, then write code on top of it, create a dashboard, what have you. Those are the types of knowledge work that we can enable. Then I think you bring up one more thing which is can you create quote unquote digital employees, digital co-workers or what have you and it's all about credentials, right? So the I today you could like you can literally assign >> are you working on that as well? >> Yeah. So in fact we introduced something called agent 365 as a way to give identities in fact extending the identities we have for humans today. The evolution from chat to autonomous agents and mirroring what happened in coding and that pattern is about to reshape every knowledge work job over the next 3 to 5 years. So sadas using coding as a template here and I think that's exactly right. We started with autocomplete just to suggesting the next line. Then we got chat inferences where you could ask questions. Then tools that could take actions in your codebase. Now we have fully autonomous agents that can run in the background, work on your repo, and come back with pull requests. That's a little bit of coding jargon there at the end, but it's basically changing these workflows and making engineers way more efficient. Cursor, claw code, GitHub, copilot agents, they all do this now. And the key insight is that you use all of these form factors simultaneously. It's not like one replaces the other. You have the agent working in the background while you're editing in the foreground while chat is helping you think through a problem. In fact, I even have some VI coding running right now as I speak. That composition is what knowledge work is going to look like. The notion CEO framing was a manager of infinite minds. It's actually pretty useful for understanding this. You're not going to have one AI assistant. You're going to have dozens of AI agents each specialized for different tasks and your job becomes coordinating them. Sadia calls it macro delegate, micro steer. You have a big instruction, the agent starts working and you course correct along the way. That's fundamentally different from the request response pattern of traditional chat interfaces. It's closer to managing a team than using a tool. Now, I've got one bonus clip from you, which is Kathy revealing where she's focusing on in this market. we are very focused on, you know, more pure play uh future winners. I'm not saying the Mag Six won't win. Uh in many ways they will uh but they certainly any company that is in the broad-based benchmarks and has risen to the top has has gotten there because of past performance and a certain DNA that worked uh during the last 20 years or so. We think there's so much disruption happening now, technologically enabled disruption. Uh some that will benefit, some that will not benefit the mag six. So um we are much more focused on you know the the companies that are not as well known but are going to benefit enormously from uh from the year ahead and uh the years ahead. And and I will say last year the market starting to broaden out away from the MAG Six. Uh we outperformed we're in the top 5% I think four of our uh five uh four of the top five ETFs by Morning Star. And even for the last three years we're in the top 5%. So I think the market is beginning to understand what we've been trying to say for for for a long time now."
