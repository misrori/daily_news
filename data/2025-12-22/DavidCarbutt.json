        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I've got three massive clips for you today. Firstly, we've got a message to Elon Musk from Bernie Sanders, which let's just say is a little bit divisive. We've then got the All-In Boys, specifically Chimath and JC reacting to it and making some pretty good points. And then finally, I've got a clip from Walter Isacson explaining why Elon Musk isn't in it for the money. First up, we got Bernie. Check this out. Hello Elon Musk. This is Senator Bernie Sanders. I was delighted to hear that through the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence and robotics that you are funding, you will be bringing about utopia to the world. You have told us that poverty will be wiped out, work will be optional, there will be universal high income, and that everyone will have the best medical care, food, home, transport, and everything else. That is wonderful news. I just have a couple of questions. How will this utopia come about? If young people can't find the entrylevel jobs that used to exist and they are unemployed without income, when are they going to get the free housing you talk about? If manufacturing workers lose their jobs because robots take their place, when are they going to get the free health care you promise? If a young nurse with kids loses her job, how is she going to get the food she needs to feed her family? I look forward to hearing about how you and your other oligarch friends are going to provide working people with a magnificent life that you promise. Because let's not forget, Donald Trump, the guy you got elected, is kicking 15 million people off their healthcare, doubling insurance premiums for more than 20 million, and is making massive cuts to nutrition assistance and education for kids across the country. With that track record, I can't wait to hear how your plan to provide universal high income for every American is going to be implemented. Have a nice day. Okay, so some pretty classic takes from Bley. You can imagine how well this has gone down in Silicon Valley. So without further ado, let's hear from the Allin Boys. Why would Bernie Sanders think he would not look totally foolish in putting that video out? And the reason it went viral is not because it sounded so crazy. It was that to some faction and percentage of people, it sounded rational and reasonable. And the problem that highlights is that we have a huge perception issue in AI. We have a handful of companies. All the PR that you see from those handful of companies is a bunch of circular deal making. The bunch of capital that flows from one to the other. It causes these stocks to go up of which a small percentage of people benefit. And at the tail end of it, it's accompanied by a completely different set of articles that everybody also reads. about this sort of damocles that's about to fall on their head whether it's electricity prices or whether it's their jobs or whether it's the jobs of their children or the quality of their education. So we have a big perception problem. So the question at hand is how do we fix it? How do we get back to the place where a video talking about stopping all progress would seem as laughable as it should be? And I think you can go back to the guilded age and you can ask the question, how did the industrialist leaders of that era respond through that 1880 to 1920 age of industrialization when you had all of this technological upheaval accompanied by a handful of people with incredible success, right? Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, Henry Ford. What did they do? And I think the lesson we can borrow from them is we now need to be on the forward foot as an industry. Enough of the stupid haircuts, dumb watches, ugly clothes, ostentatious displays of wealth. We've all done it. I've been guilty of it. It has to stop. Absolutely stop. And instead, we need to start to use a percentage of the balance sheets of these companies in order to benefit as many Americans as possible. That is the absolute minimum. Andrew Carnegie built 2500 libraries. The idea was as he built the railroads, you're going to scale GDP. You're going to scale education and knowledge. Those libraries are artifacts that allowed people to feel a dividend from that industrial revolution. John D. Rockefeller took all of his wealth and invested in institutions and universities. Henry Ford specifically focused on wages. We need to self-organize better and we need to be more on the forward foot. We need to start doing things that are practically measurable by tens of millions of American citizens. And it starts to beat back the perception problem that we have because Sax pointed out last week, the data does not support the misperception. But the problem is, and Sax and I were talking about this last week, the misperception is gaining steam. And so I think we need to use these tools that we have to provide some more practical benefits that every man, woman, and child can feel. Otherwise, this thing is going to build and you'll see crazier and crazier versions of this Bernie Sanders video. >> All right. I think it's well said. And you know, as I said last week, I think beating China does not matter to the average American. It's below their line, Shimoth. Uh I think in many ways what they care about is jobs. They care about their kids getting jobs. And yeah, they care about costs. They care about inflation. They care about energy costs going up. Our industry has done a terrible job of explaining how this benefits the average American. And they're seeing all these headlines about, as you mentioned, all the cross deal booking and all these stocks going up. Half the country doesn't own stocks, so they're not participating in it. And they're not blind to seeing self-driving cars or seeing their kids having a hard time getting a job. and they're hearing everybody talk about job displacement and that's a valid concern. People are scared and our industry is scaring them I think by not meeting where they are and then beating China respectfully is important. Sachs super important. I can intellectually agree with you on that. But if you lose your and your kids can't get a job that's that's existential. Yes. It's not my child needs a job next year. They're graduating from school with $100,000 in debt and my energy bills going up and my grocery bills are going up and they haven't come down. That's what Americans are experiencing. And yeah, maybe giving uh I think you also made an interesting point there too. The AI and tech industry has a perception problem that can only be solved by delivering real measurable benefits to ordinary Americans. In my opinion, Chamar frames it perfectly when he says they, meaning Silicon Valley and AI companies, need to start doing things that are practically measurable by tens of millions of American citizens. For example, how Carneg built 2,500 libraries. The Bernie Sanders video went viral because to a significant chunk of Americans, it didn't sound crazy at all. It sounded reasonable, and that should terrify everybody in tech who is watching. We're watching the same PR play out that we saw 140 years ago during the industrial revolution. Incredible wealth concentration alongside genuine fear from working people about their livelihoods. The difference is the Carnegie and the Rockefellers of that era figured out they needed to give something tangible back. And I also think Jason's point about beating China is worth sitting with for a moment. He's right that it doesn't resonate with most Americans. If your kid just graduated with $100,000 in debt and can't find an entry-level job because companies are using AI to reduce headcount, you don't care about geopolitical competition. You care about next month's rent. Half the country doesn't own stocks. So, when they see headlines about Nvidia hitting new highs or circular deals between AI companies, they're not participating in any of it. They're just watching wealth accumulate somewhere else while reading articles about how their job might disappear. What Martha is describing is essentially corporate social responsibility. Cardig's libraries were a form of social license. They let people feel like they were getting something from all that industrial disruption. The AI industry right now is producing nothing like that. They're producing benchmarks and model comparisons and stock gains. None of that means anything to a nurse wondering if she'll be replaced by a diagnostic software. The good news, if you could call it that, is that this problem seems fixable. The data doesn't actually support the Doom narrative yet. Layoffs attributed to AI are still a tiny percentage of total job losses. Construction workers are seeing wages rise 30% because of data center buildouts. There's real upside happening in parts of the economy. The tech industry just needs to get better at showing that and more importantly directing some of their balance sheets towards things regular people can actually feel. Education, healthcare, housing. Pick one and go allin. That's how you beat a perception problem before it becomes a political problem. And when you look at who's actually doing this right now, who's reinvesting wealth into solving problems rather than just accumulating it, there's one person everyone seems to keep coming back to. >> The weird thing about Musk, we're talking about Elon Musk pay package for those of us who haven't been following this, uh, is that Musk, it's almost like points in a video game for him. He may become the first trillionaire ever, but it's not because he likes buying yachts and islands and vacation homes. is because he's almost addicted to scoring the points. And uh that's what he's done with his new pay package and getting the Delaware Supreme Court, I guess it was, to restore the old one >> because he he obviously has he bought a yacht yet? I don't think this is not not his thing. >> I remember when I was writing about him this little two-bedroom house in Bokeh Chica and uh so I don't think his thing is to spend money on himself. It's like he's an avatar in his own video game and he wants to rack up the points and get to each new level. He also though more seriously, especially when it comes to Tesla, really wants control, meaning for him at least 24 25% cuz he thinks it will be an AI company. And one of the things he's doing that to me is interesting is it's AI that's physical AI, real world AI. We've gone through a year where everybody's been waving their hands about large language models and predictive generative AI. The more interesting AI will be things that actually can operate in the real world. Cars that drive, drones that can make things, robots that can take visual information and operate the way humans can. That's going to be the next wave of AI. That's where he sees Tesla's future. And because he has this grand fear for the past 40 years that our robots will kill us. He read Isaac Azimov once too often as a kid. He wants to make sure that he has basic control of Tesla. >> You think that that Isaac Isaac Azimov might be too paranoid? Do you think that there actually Azimov's books are very good and the the rules of the robotics I robot and that they won't destroy humanity turns out pretty much okay but it certainly put some fear in Musk >> Elon Musk's approach to wealth shows he's playing a different game than traditional billionaires he's not accumulating money to spend on himself he's using it as fuel to build things that actually changes the world there's a cartoonish version of billionaires that exists in the public perception some guy twirling his mustache on a yacht holding gold coins minds like Scrooge. And for some wealthy people, that's not too far from reality. They hit their number and then they spend the rest of their lives consuming. Vacation homes, art collections, whatever status symbols their peer group values. Elon doesn't fit that mold at all. The guy who's been living in a two-bedroom house at SpaceX's launch site while running half a dozen companies. That tells you something about priorities. When people complain about Elon potentially becoming the first trillionaire, they're treating his net worth like it's cash sitting in a bank account. It's not. His wealth exists because Tesla and SpaceX and XAI are doing economically useful things for millions of people. NASA relies on SpaceX. Starlink provides internet to remote areas and war zones. Tesla pushed the entire auto industry towards electrification years ahead of where it would have gone otherwise. The wealth is a byproduct of solving hard problems, not the goal itself. This is actually what Schmath was talking about. Carneg built libraries, yes, but he also built the steel industry. Rockefeller created universities, but he also made oil cheap enough so that regular people could light their homes. The philanthropy mattered, but the real impact came from building things that changed everyday life. That's what Elon is doing with physical AI and autonomous vehicles. Elon's building entirely new industries that could transform transportation, energy, and manufacturing. The irony is that governments spend $40 trillion per year collectively and haven't solved the problems people demand even solve with his wealth. If you confiscate everything he owns, it would fund global government spending for a week or so. Then it would be gone. The wealth would be consumed rather than deployed. What makes someone like Elon different from the consumption focused billionaire class is that he keeps throwing the money back into increasingly ambitious projects. Rockets, robots, neural interfaces. These are long-term bets on humanity, not short-term indulges. You don't have to agree with everything he does to recognize that there's a meaningful difference between billionaires who build and billionaires who just buy things. If you're struggling to think of what you want for Christmas or you need to find a gift for an AI nerd, I made the AI course I wish I had when I first started studying the industry. If you buy now, you get lifetime access to everything that's already in there, plus new modules that we'll be adding. As we add new modules, the price will be going up over time. Check the link in the description. Cheers."

        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, I've genuinely got a huge show for you today with Dana White calling Mark Zuckerberg a gangster after him getting the inside scoop on Meta's board meetings. Dan Ives listing through the huge opportunity AI is presenting humanity and then a final clip on why Jensen is such an extraordinary leader leading arguably the most important company in the world right now. Brace yourself for three banger clips. And now AI. Have you got into AI yet? >> We're dabbling. Okay. >> I'm trying. Yes, sir. >> So Meta AI. I got, you know, I'm on the board for Meta. I just got back from a Meta board meeting. Zuckerberg, who is a brilliant gangster. This guy is a gangster. These people who who who try to talk about him and everything else. I'm so blown away and impressed by this guy. He's an animal. >> And uh putting all the chips in on AI. We just hired like 10 kids that are aged 22 to 28. The average salary is like $65 million that these kids are making that are coming in working on AI. But AI, you know, you hear a lot of negativity about AI. There's way more positives about AI than negative. So you start looking at AI and getting into it and asking AI, how do I build my business? how do I, you know, and it'll start giving you some ideas and uh you can create agents inside AI that update you every day on your business and and and giving you ideas >> on how to take uh everything to the next level in 26. So, you should just be thinking about leveling up in 26. Set a goal, right? If if if you want to drive from here to Tulsa, Oklahoma, you'd have to go on a map and you'd have to lay out, you know, your route and all. You got to do the same thing for your business. Map out your route for 26 and figure out where you want to be as you go into 27. >> Yeah. >> And get it done. >> How do How do you How do you uh how are you applying the AI? I mean like in what? Like I know we're using it to help with graphic design. We're using it a little to help on editing a video, but is there something I'm missing? >> Yes. All of that. So AI is only as good as the questions you ask it. >> Right. If you want to go on and use it for treat it like it's Google, you know what I mean? You're missing the boat. You you can ask AI anything about your business. We'll with a little bit when we're done >> with the podcast and I'll kind of show you how you can >> for sure. >> Yeah. >> Dana White's firsthand account of Mark Zuckerberg's leadership reveals why founderled companies can make transformational bets that hired executives simply cannot. Dana White sitting on Meta's board describes Mark Zuckerberg as a brilliant gangster who's putting all the chips in on AI, even hiring young AI talent at average salaries of $65 million per year. What makes Dana White's perspective so valuable is that he's built one of the most demanding businesses in entertainment. Dana White literally operates in the fight business. Let's be honest, taming some of those high testosterone young fighters and building an organization around it must be probably one of the most erratic ventures you could possibly undertake. And bearing in mind, it came from nothing. And it's pretty much defined a new sporting category. When someone with that background watches Mark Zuckerberg operate and comes away describing him as an animal, for me, I think that carries some weight. The hiring numbers Dana mentions are staggering. Meta is paying 22 to 28 year olds $65 million a year in average salaries to work on AI. Most corporate boards would never approve that kind of compensation for what might be arguably unproven talent. Most CEOs would face shareholder revolts for writing those kind of checks. Zuckerberg can do it because he controls the company he answers to himself. And this connects to the broader thesis about founder businesses. When Zuckerberg decided the metaverse pivot was failing, he could course correct without getting fired. When he decided AI was the future, he could bet the company's resources on it. A hired CEO at a similar company would have spent 6 months building consensus, another 6 months getting board approval, and then execute a watered down version of the strategy. And this is why Dana's experience is so valuable. He built the UFC from a struggling promotion into a global phenomenon by making bold, unconventional decisions. He recognizes that same energy in Zucks. The ability to go allin when you see an opportunity is what separates transformational leaders from caretaker managers who preserve the status quo. Now check out this clip from Dan Ives. >> How are we going to fuel these data centers? Is it [clears throat] going to be nuclear or is it going to be solar or it's going to be nuclear? >> So So right the reality is like to put in numbers 3% of US companies have gone down the AI path. >> Okay. When you get to 20% based on current energy, >> right, >> there there's >> you run out of energy. >> You you you don't have enough. >> Okay, >> that would mean that you based on the grid, people's lights would go out in their houses as D. >> If data centers go online, our lights will go off. >> So, we're going to have to make a choice unless we find an alternative. >> And it's nuclear to me. And it's nuclear. To me, nuclear, that's what China is going. Solar and grid could maybe do some things around the edges, but nuclear is ultimately going to be the answer for the US. And I think right now the only thing that stops or slows down the AI revolution in the US >> is energy. >> That is energy. >> It's not capital, >> right? use cases, right? Demand. It's a bubble. Demand. It's it's >> it's the energy. Okay. Because at the end of the day, if you can't turn on the lights, you got nothing going on. You can build you can build all the infrastructure, but if it can't run, it's it's not it doesn't have value. >> And I think a big area in 2026 is going to be like how do you play energy? Who are names that could be the answer? >> That was my next question. >> And I think that's >> are you allowed to tell me? I mean, do you know I mean are there companies that come to N to light that you can mention that would be new companies that actually support the nuclear grid? >> I think I think GE VOVA is a good example. >> GE spin-off, correct? >> I think um iron is another example. Aqua clearly is a nuclear play as OK. But um okay l but then but then there's going to be many others that that maybe are private today >> that I think will be public and that's yeah so the thing is like that that to me is going to be one of the biggest opportunities right >> go going forward. >> So anyway we interviewed yesterday there's a guy there's a a magazine called Payload. Payload is a magazine uh that deals with all the stocks in the space space, >> right? And we were talking about the uh SpaceX IPO >> and then we were talking about tech and he we gentleman he they've made a now an arrangement with the NYC that they're going to be doing some stuff analyzing a lot of the space stocks that are here hoping to bring uh uh SpaceX IPO to the New York Stock Exchange. He did talk about data centers in space right which is a fascinating thing which is actually a thing now right it was never a thing because of the the risk was way offline but recently they've come to grips with the fact that solar so what does it mean data centers in space means that you're going to build you're going to use uh a solar from spa if we're building them in space right in space apparently there is nothing there's no nothing that the efficiency of the solar solar energy source up in up in space is huge, right? There's no impediments to it. There's nothing, you know, there's no gravity in between it, so there's nothing blocking it. And that if we could take the risk out of that and build them, what what's your feeling on that? >> Look, I mean, it's going to be it's it's another area we talk about where like this is a fourth industrial revolution, >> right? from space to nuclear to energy to AI to the consumer to autonomous to robotics, >> right? >> Like that's that's where it's all going. Like look, I remember like you've always said during like liberation that we were going to Jetsons and then maybe that we were going to >> the Flintstones, >> but we're going back to Jetsons, >> right? You know, and when you look at the Jetsons, like that is real, you know, like that's >> it will become real in our lives. You said it when I met you the first day when I came to you and said, \"Explain to me about AI. I don't get it. Are kids going to be outsourced?\" Right? People are talking to me youngsters, high school and college students are asking me like, \"Is this AI thing going to make it difficult for us to find jobs when we come out?\" And you said absolutely they're wrong because AI is going to benefit our lives way more than it's going to jeopardize our lives and there's going to be way more opportunity. Now the opportunities may have be a little bit different. It may be in the AI sector but it's going to be a little different. >> And that speaks to the opportunities that you know I think as an investor it's very easy to get shortsighted with just stock movements, right? >> You have to just be able to recognize like who are the winners? How do you play this market, >> right, >> and use sometimes the white knuckle moments to to really in my view those are the golden opportunities. >> Yeah. So, we've seen it. No, we're not done yet. We've seen over the last year that we've gone through the es and the flows. >> Dan I's argument that only 3% of US companies have adopted AI reveals we're at the very beginning of a transformation whose ultimate applications remain unknown. The 3% adoption figure should stop every investor in their tracks. If we're already seeing the infrastructure buildout, the stock price appreciation, and the market excitement at 3% penetration, what happens when that number reaches 10% or 20%. The market is pricing in growth, but it may be dramatically underestimating the scale of what's coming. What Dan identifies as the primary bottleneck shifts the entire investment conversation. Most bubble fears center on whether the technology will deliver ROI, whether demand is real, or whether competition will erode margins. Dan says none of those are the actual constraint. The real limiter is physical infrastructure. You can have unlimited demand, unlimited capital, and unlimited use cases. If you cannot turn on the lights, nothing else matters. And this creates a fascinating investment framework. The AI winners we can identify today are companies providing compute, software, and infrastructure. The AI winners of 2030 might be applications we cannot even conceptualize right now. When smartphones launched, nobody predicted Uber, Door Dash, or Instagram. The platform enabled business models that were literally unimaginable before the technology existed. And now to another magnificent company led by a killer founder. Here's a clip on Jensen. >> AI has turned out to be heavy industry. I mean, we are brute forcing our way to smarter machines with these gigantic data centers that are filled with hundreds of thousands and sometimes millions of NVIDIA chips. You know, Jensen has described those as AI factories where data goes in and intelligence comes out and that's the world we live in now. Um whether Jensen can maintain that central position with all of these competitors coming online, I guess is a question we'll answer in the next couple years. >> Yeah. So there there's the company Nvidia and there's also the man right into Sherry's point a couple of seconds ago about leadership. I mean uh I think the job of most great leaders is to start thinking and planning for succession. That doesn't seem to be happening uh at Nvidia. I mean okay granted the guy just he's just past middle age. He's not that old, right? But I mean there is the whole issue of of keyman risk. Were you able to talk to him about that? And and what did he say? >> I was I was like what's your succession plan? He's like I don't have one. Simple as that. There's no designated successor. You know, if you look at a typical company, you've got one guy on top or one woman on top and then you've got maybe 10 or 12 kind of like people answering to the chief executive. At at Nvidia, it's like 60 people. Okay, Jensen's at the top. There's no second layer of management. And then the third layer is just like 60 or 70 people all answering to him. So, how he manages to do that, it's sort of extraordinary. It's not what you expect from sort of classic modes of management, but he somehow is capable of just answering, you know, 10 or 15 times as many emails, responding to 10 or 15 times as as initiatives, managing that many more people as anyone else. Now, part of the secret is that those executives are themselves extraordinarily capable. Jensen is surrounded by brilliant, brilliant people and he drives them very, very hard. So he can go to one of his lieutenants and give them a task and say, \"Come back in six months when you've completed this. I'm delegating all of this authority to you. Go do it and come back.\" And because he's been so careful about who he's hired, that can actually happen, which I think is rare at other companies and harder to do. But, you know, I talked to the members of the board a little bit like, is there a succession plan? And one board member said basically, look, we have a couple names in mind. We've thought about this issue a little, but I'm going to be real with you. Jensen is irreplaceable. >> Nvidia board members admitting Jensen Hang is irreplaceable illustrates again why investors should pay premium multiples for companies with exceptional founder leaders at the helm. The organizational structure Jensen has built would be dismissed as impossible by any business school professor. 60 direct reports with no middle management layer violates every principle of organizational design. Yet, Nvidia has executed flawlessly through the most demanding period in semiconductor history while operating this way. The key insight is that Jensen has been meticulously building this company for 30 years. He was designing chips for video games when most current tech executives were still in school. That institutional knowledge, those supply relationships, that deep technical understanding, none of that can be transferred through a PowerPoint presentation during a CEO transition. So again, we're touching on a broader investment philosophy about founder companies. When you invest in Nvidia, you're not just buying exposure to AI compute demand. You're buying Jensen's decisionmaking, his ability to see around corners, his willingness to make massive bets on technology years before competitors recognized their importance. The CUDA ecosystem didn't happen by accident, nor the data center pivot. That didn't happen by accident either. These were deliberate strategy. These were deliberate strategic choices made by someone who understood the technology at a fundamental level. Nvidia's board admission that they've thought about this issue just a little bit but considered Jensen as irreplaceable is remarkably and brutally honest. Most boards would offer some BS succession planning. The Nvidia board have essentially said we have no real plan because there is no real replacement. YouTube isn't just entertainment. It's one of the best client acquisition tools because it builds trust at scale. We've helped businesses grow from scratch to a $100,000 month just by launching them a YouTube channel.

        "transcript": "Well, if you love tech, Palanteer or AI, I've got a juicy one for you today as we've got two clips. One featuring co-founder and CEO Alex Cop and another their CTO Sham Sanka. Enjoy. >> I talk to people in technology every day. These are software developers who are whose productivity has exploded using say clawed code um and then uh attaching themselves to like uh in the information from say Google docs or even notion and it is incredible to them what they're able to do with the same budgets and even the same amount of time. to speak to what people are experiencing with AI today and the fear-mongering and fear of fermenting out of Bernie Sanders. AB: >> Absolutely. I mean, examples like Claude Code, you can see how it's transforming the work of of classically white collar workers. But I think the story that's really under reportported is how AI is a bluecollar revolution. It is the frontline factory worker. It is the ICU nurse who has more time to spend with their patients delivering life-saving care where minutes actually matter, less time monging and collecting the information on the patient. It is the manufacturing line where the foreman has to spend less time doing the production planning and the labor scheduling, more time actually building parts. And I think the key narrative violation that the Vanguard study really shows is not only are these workers more productive, these companies are able to hire more. I'll give you one example. We have a manufacturing customer that because they were able to streamline their production planning with AI, they were able to add a third shift. Without that labor utilization being at a certain rate, it wasn't profitable to hire more American workers. With it, more jobs are created. Or we look at Panasonic energy. They're in Reno, Nevada. They build electric vehicle batteries. Uh the apprenticeship to become a skilled battery technician on for this sort of equipment is three years. With AI, they've been able to take prior casino workers and gainfully employ them. successfully in 3 months. This is creating American jobs. And I think the root of this dumerism, first of all, it was it's a complete propaganda stick coming out of Silicon Valley where they want to talk about how powerful the tech is. It's so powerful it might lead to mass unemployment. It's so powerful it might end humanity. And that's just frankly not true. It's not what you see at the front lines. What you see is an opportunity for American greatness, an opportunity to re-industrialize and build deterrence again. >> Yeah, let me jump in here. Uh, one of the narratives out there is it it can work well for, you know, the experienced worker who gets more productive. You talked about that. Maybe the nurse or the frontline manufacturing worker, but it it makes less space for the new worker because the other ones are so productive, you don't have to hire the young people coming out of college or whatever. How do you respond to that part of the narrative about AI job loss? I I think the Panasonic energy example is a really great example there where they're using AI to train their workforce and to accelerate the training time from 3 years to 3 months which obviously improves the the labor pool you can go after and the productivity of the worker the ramp the opportunities involved. So I I think it's going to have a dramatic effect on how we uh are able to hire train and deploy early talent as well. But I also because you it's the blue collar, white collar. I just think about AI and the tools that are already at people's fingertips. It could lead and will pro and will lead to an explosion of new businesses where you have an idea and the tools will be there for you to execute on that idea and maybe like college be dog on. I don't need to go to college. That's that's interesting. What about college? Is it make does this make college less relevant? >> I think colleges are going to have to reinvent themselves. We at Palanter, we started a meritocracy fellowship that takes high school seniors and we provide them, you know, they're going to learn their techn technical skills on the job and in nights and weekends. We bring in professors, we give them a well-rounded education on the western cannon. Uh I'm I I think colleges are going to have to really rethink this. AI makes previously unprofitable operations viable, which creates entirely new positions that didn't exist before. Shamsanker describes a manufacturing customer that added a third shift specifically because AI streamed their production planning. Without that improvement in labor utilization, hiring more American workers wasn't profitable. AI made this expansion possible. Most conversations about AI and jobs start from the wrong place. They assume a fixed amount of work exists in the economy and if machines do more of it, humans do less. Economists call this the lump of labor fallacy and it's been wrong every time we've had a major technological shift. The third technological shift example Sharm gives is worth spending some time on because it shows exactly how this works in practice. A manufacturing plant has fixed costs. The building, the equipment, and the management overhead. These costs exist whether you run one shift or three. When you only run one or two shifts, you're spreading those fixed costs across fewer production hours. Each unit you make carries a bigger share of the overhead. Now, imagine your production planning is a mess. Your foreman spends half his day figuring out which workers go where, which machines run which jobs, and how to sequence everything so nothing sits idle. That planning time is expensive. It slows everything down. It means you can't predict your output accurately. It means sometimes you have workers standing around waiting for instructions. In that environment, adding a third shift sounds great in theory, but falls apart in practice. You'd need another layer of management to handle the planning complexity. Your coordination costs would explode, and the margin on that third shift production probably wouldn't cover the additional overhead. This is where AI completely changed the maths. When production planning happens automatically, when the system already knows which workers are available and which machines are ready, suddenly that third shift becomes profitable. The coordination costs that made it impossible just disappeared. And then you can hire a whole new crew of workers. Night shift positions that didn't exist before, not replacing anyone from the first or second shift, brand new jobs. This pattern repeats across industries whenever AI removes a bottleneck that was limiting scale. Healthcare is full of these bottlenecks. Emergency departments turn away patients, not because they lack beds, but because they lack the administrative capacity to process more admissions. Logistics companies face similar constraints. A trucking firm might have enough drivers and enough trucks to move more freight, but their dispatching becomes chaotic beyond a certain scale. Too many variables to optimize manually. So, they leave money on the table. They turn down shipments they could technically handle. AI dispatch systems push that ceiling higher. More freight moved means more drivers hired. The Panasonic energy example Shan mentioned shows another angle of this. They build electric vehicles, batteries in Nevada for Tesla. The apprenticeship for a skilled battery technician took three years because the knowledge transfer was slow and expensive. You needed experienced workers, mentoring new ones, correcting mistakes, explaining edge cases. That three-year ramp meant a tiny pipeline of qualified workers. AI compressed that into 3 months. Now, think about what's happening to the labor pool when your training bottleneck disappears. Suddenly you can hire from a much larger population. People who would never have waited three years for an apprenticeship can now enter the field. You haven't replaced any existing technicians. You've just made it possible to hire far more of them. Char's framing of AI as a bluecollar revolution is important here. The public conversation about AI focuses almost entirely on knowledge work. Writers worried about chat GBT. Programmers worried about co-pilot. Lawyers worried about contract review automation. But the biggest gains are happening on factory floors and in hospitals and across supply chains, places where the constraint was never intelligence. It was coordination. It was getting the right information to the right person at the right time so they could do their actual job instead of hunting for data. Silicon Valley pictures AI as artificial general intelligence slowly awakening to consciousness. Mass unemployment as machines learn to do everything humans can do. that given humans the information and time they need to use their judgment more effectively. The propaganda angle Sham identifies has had real consequences. When the narrative says AI destroys jobs, policy follows. You get calls for regulation, taxation, and slow deployment. All based on a prediction that evidence doesn't even support. Every major technological transition in history has followed the same pattern. short-term displacement in specific roles, long-term job creation as the economy restructures around new capabilities. The printing press didn't create permanent unemployment for scribes. It created entirely new industries around books. What's different about AI is the speed. Previous transitions played out over generations. This one is happening in years. That compression creates real challenges for workers who need to adapt quickly. But the solution is to accelerate training and skill development. exactly what Palanteer is doing with their programs like their meritocracy fellowship. >> Merry Christmas, happy Hanukkah, a joyous new year and a happy holiday to everyone celebrating. We at Palanteer are deeply grateful for your support, your generosity. We know how courageous you many of you have to have been to support us in public and in private while we attempt to support uh the war fighters and others who do deeply important and often dangerous things to secure our way of life. that undergurred the superiority of the west. We believe palanteer is a metaphor for the splendor and artistry and discipline necessary to build great things. What has made the west great over thousands of years. And one of the reasons I do this video on cross country skiing is it's a very similar analogy. You train and train and train to get your V2 max where it could work. You train the technique. You train strength. You train all year while everyone is having fun. You're just training and sleeping and training and working and then you get to enjoy the splendor of gliding across the snow, gliding uphill, just suspending gravity. In many ways, that's what Palanter did in the last year, last couple years. We suspended the gravity that was apparently the viscosity that was going to hold down the true greatness of our ability to make institutions especially in the west stronger, better, more secure. Make American and other workers uh uh better in their job. Raise their pricing par. Make American soldiers, war fighters deadlier, safer, protect data, do these things that are cornerstone to the West. And we could not have done it without your help. and we are deeply grateful and hope every single one of you who supported us has a wonderful and joyous holiday. Thank you for all your help. >> Palanteer's success comes from making bold decisions when the rest of the industry ran in the other direction. Working with the government and military when it was toxic in Silicon Valley, embedding engineers directly with customers when everyone else sold software and walked away. K's message talks about the courage required to support Palanteer publicly and privately about supporting war fighters doing dangerous work to secure the West. Palanteer spent years building capabilities while everyone else was chasing consumer apps. Palanteer made two strategic choices early on that defined everything that followed. Both at the time looked like mistakes. The first was focusing on government and military customers when Silicon Valley wanted nothing to do with them. Remember what tech looked like in the mid 2000s? Google's model was don't be evil. The prestige path for an engineer meant working on consumer products with hundreds of millions of users. Defense contracts were the opposite. Slow procurement cycles, security clearances, cultural stigma that made recruitment harder. Palanteer's founders saw something the industry missed. Government agencies had massive data problems and virtually no modern software to solve them. The intelligence community needed tools to connect information across agencies. The failure not having that in place left America open to attack. So Palanteer built that for the customer and they learned things you can only learn in those environments. Defense customers push software harder than any commercial customer will. The stakes are life and death. The adversaries are sophisticated. The reliability requirements are absolute. Every capability built for government became technology they could later bring to commercial customers who needed the same battle tested infrastructure. The second bold choice was the forward deployed engineer model. Traditional enterprise software works like this. Sales teams sell them the product. Implementation consultants configure it. The customer gets a login and documentation. Support tickets get filed when things break. Palanteer rejected that completely. They put actual software engineers on site with customers. People who could write code, modify the product, and solve problems in real time. The industry thought this was crazy. The whole point of software is scalability. Build once, sell infinitely. Putting engineers on planes seems like a service business pretending to be a software company. But Palanteer understood something subtle. The failure mode for most enterprise AI deployments is the implementation. Software works fine in the demo when it meets messy data, weird edge cases, organizational politics, and users who don't want to change how they work. Most projects die in that gap. Forward deployed engineers close it. They learn how the customer's business actually operates. They see the problems the product team would never imagine and they feed that knowledge back into the platform. Every deployment makes the product smarter. This also creates switching costs traditional software can't match. When an engineer has spent months embedded in your operations, building workflows specific to your needs, moving to a competitor means starting over from scratch. If I could recommend one place to start learning AI, it would be this course I put together. It's clear, structured, and designed for beginners who want to genuinely get knowledgeable about AI. You'll get lifetime access to all lessons, including future modules. And just a heads up, the price will be increasing as more modules are added. So, it's currently at the lowest price you'll see. Also, it could make a good Christmas present. Check out the link in the description. Cheers. Most people pour money into ads people ignore. YouTube changes that. It builds trust, authority, and a real connection at scale. One law firm we worked with landed 33 clients in just five months worth $330,000 from their YouTube channel. If you run a business, this is one of the most overlooked opportunities right now. Book a call with me below and I can show you how we can make it"
