        "transcript": "2025 was, well, it happened. After what was probably one of the most underwhelming years in crypto's history, many investors are left scratching their heads, wondering what the hell happened to the parabolic gains we were all expecting. Luckily, a recent report sums up the crypto market in 2025, and it puts everything into perspective. So, today, we're summarizing that report for you in simple terms and telling you what to look out for in the year ahead. My name is Louis and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Before we begin though, you do need to know that I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. It's educational content intended to inform you about a recent crypto report. If that sounds good, prove it by pounding that like button and let's get into it. So, the report we'll be summarizing today is the quote 2025 annual crypto industry report which comes from Coin Gecko. As always, we'll be giving you the key highlights right here in this video, but we will leave a link to the full report down in the description for you if you're interested in that. The report begins with an overview of the crypto industry, which ended 2025 with a $3 trillion market cap. This was actually down 10% from 2024 and marked the first year since 2022 where the total crypto market cap had actually fallen. To be fair, though, things were going well. At first, the crypto market hit its all-time high of 4.4 trillion in early 2025. But then in October, Trump announced 100% tariffs on China and crypto crashed with almost $20 billion in liquidations in a single day. This basically wiped out any gains from the previous two quarters, causing the year to close at an overall loss. Still hurts to think about. The crash was so severe, in fact, that sentiment quickly flipped to risk off. Many investors rotated out of altcoins and into stable coins, ending alt season before it even began. Bitcoin dominance closed the year at 57.4% while ETH and almost all altcoins lost dominance. The only exceptions were BNB and of course stable coins. Late 2025 was also a rough time for cryptos across the board. Even BTC suffered, dropping by 23%. But Q4 was even worse for altcoins. ETH dropped 28%, XRP dropped 35%, and Soul dropped 40%. And of course, the further down the risk curve you look, the messier it gets. In the DeFi narrative, Link and Hype dropped 43 and 44% respectively, while A dropped 47%. Then there's memecoins where SHIB fell by 42%. Doge dropped 50% and Pepe tanked by 57%. It was even a similar story with AI cryptos, which tanked across the board. Put simply, Q4 was a bloodbath. The same can't be said about gold, which enjoyed a record-breaking 62% gain throughout 2025, making it the best performing asset. US equities ranked second with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ gaining 17% and 21% respectively. Conversely, BTC closed the year at a 6% loss, making it the third worst performer of 2025, only beating crude oil and the US dollar. The report notes that gold's record year was quote driven by a historic perfect storm of central bank accumulation, geopolitical risk, and uncertainty around tariffs. This put major doubts on Bitcoin as a safe haven asset, much to the delight of prominent gold bug Peter Schiff. Moreover, BTC's poor Q4 performance caused it to decouple from the stock market. This is significant because crypto has historically tracked tech stocks, which drive much of the overall stock market. Bitcoin being left behind suggests investors are seeking gains elsewhere in the tech sector. Now, the next part of the report looks at some of the highlights of 2025. Despite the crypto's market overall underperformance, several narratives still emerged as clear winners. And of course, the same will be true in 2026. However, finding the leading narratives will require you to keep up with the latest crypto news stories.

So, what are you waiting for? Sign up using the link below or scan the QR code on the screen. Now, let's get back to the report. Believe it or not, but the top crypto categories in 2025 were meme coins and AI, holding the top spots every quarter, just like in 2024. That said, interest has faded. Meme related categories fell from 30% of investor mind share in 2024 to 19% in 2025. Even so, Salana remained the most popular ecosystem, while AI ticked up slightly from 15% to 17%. Pretty underwhelming, giving all of the AI hype elsewhere. It's a similar theme across the board. The top 20 categories accounted for 78% of user attention in 2024, but made up just 67% in 2025. The report notes that this was due to interest spreading more broadly, which was probably because everyone was trying to figure out which narrative might trigger the altcoin season that just never came. The report then covers major hacks from the year. Standouts include bybit, which suffered the largest ever crypto hack in February, losing 1.5 billion to North Korean hackers in the form of the Lazarus group. Cedus, a sooie based dex, had its liquidity drained in May. Lazareth struck again in November against South Korean exchange Upbit before DeFi protocol urine finance lost $9 million in December. Altogether, $2.38 billion was stolen in 2025 with most being stolen from Bybit alone. Next, the report looks at digital asset treasury companies or DATs, which spent nearly $50 billion acquiring crypto in 2025. Roughly half of that came in Q3 alone before the October crash dragged Dash share prices down and slammed the brakes on their buying. Even so, DA that's ended the year with 134 billion in crypto, up 137% from 56 billion back in 2024. By year end, they held over 1 million BTC and 6 million ETH, over 5% of both supplies. Next up are prediction markets, which became a hot niche after the 2024 presidential elections. Notional volume jumped over 300% in 2025, reaching 63.5 billion. Poly market started the year with 85% market share. What's surprising though is that Poly Market was overtaken by Khi in Q4. By year end, KI held a 39% share of the market while Poly Market had 32%. What's even more surprising is that prediction markets have largely shifted from politics to sports with sports related trades making up 90% of Kali's notional volume. The report notes that quote competition is just heating up within this nation's sector suggesting that it could be an important niche to watch in 2026. Next, the report examines protocol revenue excluding blockchains. What's wild is that Tether alone generated nearly 42% of all protocol revenue in 2025 at over 5 billion. In fact, four of the top 10 protocols were related to stable coins. The remaining six were trading protocols, though their revenue was heavily dependent on market conditions. Next, the report covers privacy coins, which dominated the narrative in Q4. Zcash led the pack with ZEC surging over 800%. However, interest in privacy didn't always translate to gains for privacy related cryptos. For instance, the report highlights Tasos and Starknet, which fell 61% and 83% respectively. After that, the report looks at Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Salana. BTC hit an all-time high of 124K in early October before dropping 23% after the October 10th liquidations, including a 10% drop in 1 day, which is nuts given that Bitcoin's market cap is in the trillions of dollars. BTC fell below 100K on November 13th and hasn't recovered at the time of shooting, ending 2025 down by 6%. This had a knock-on effect for Bitcoin miners, squeezing their profitability. In Q3, before the crash, Bitcoin's hash rate, which is the level of compute powering the network, grew by 35%. By Q4, it had dropped 14%. That said, the hash rate hit an all-time high on October 24th, reaching 1.3 zeta hashes, meaning miners were performing 1.3 sexillion calculations per second to secure the network. And yes, that is a real number. The report then zooms in on the US spot Bitcoin ETFs, which saw their first ever quarter of net outflows in Q4 at just over $1 billion. Still, they ended 2025 with 120 billion in assets under management or AUM, which was up 13% from 2024. Just goes to show you how massive Black Rockck, Gayscale, Fidelity, and others really are. Speaking of which, the report points out that not all Bitcoin ETFs saw outflows in Q4. Some even had net inflows. Overall, Black Rockck's IBIT remained the top ETF by a wide margin with 57% market share. Trailing behind were Fidelity's FBTC at 14% and Gayscale's GBTC at 12%. Next up though is Ethereum, which peaked just below 5K in Q3, barely above its November 2021 all-time high. ETH then fell 28% in Q4, ending the year down 11% overall. This is believed to be due to Ethereum ETFs flipping from net inflows in Q3 to net outflows in Q4 and slower accumulation by Ethereum DATs. Notably, ETH bounced in early December after the Fusaka upgrade was successfully deployed, but the rally was short-lived due to the overwhelmingly bearish market conditions. Still, the upcoming Glamsterdam and Higota upgrades this year could spark potential pumps. From our perspective, Ethereum still has some upside potential in 2026. In fact, the report highlights that transaction counts in Ethereum's EVM ecosystem surged 90% in 2025. This includes EVM compatible chains like BNB Smart Chain, Base, and Tron, the three of which dominated the EVM ecosystem. Ethereum itself ranked ninth, which the report says quote highlights Ethereum's role as a settlement layer, while layer 2's handle the bulk of common transactions. Next, the report zooms in on the Ethereum ETFs, which saw their strongest quarter ever in Q3 with over $9 billion in net inflows, followed by 1.5 billion in outflows in Q4, which incidentally marked the largest quarter of net outflows. You win some, you lose some. Black Rockck had the largest outflows, while Gayscale's Ethereum ETF was the only one to avoid net outflows in Q4. But despite the year-end struggles with ETF outflows and ETH's price, 2025 as a whole was a very positive year. Overall, Ethereum ETFs grew by 48%. Ending the year with nearly $18 billion in AUM. Next up is Salana, which had an even worse Q4. Soul fell 50% from $247 in Q3 to $124 in Q4, ending the year down 34%. The report notes that the highly anticipated spot Salana ETFs were approved in mid-occtober, but didn't begin trading until November due to delays from the US government's shutdown. And by then, the market damage was already done. Fortunately, the Salana ETFs did see consistent inflows, but unfortunately, this wasn't enough to reverse Souls bearish trend, which was made worse by the apparent end of memecoin mania. Where are all of the DGENs when you need them? The report then points to prop AMM or proprietary automated market makers as the backbone of Salana's liquidity. Unlike traditional AMMs like Uniswap or Radium, these use professional market makers own capital instead of crowdsource liquidity. In any case, prop AMMs accounted for 44% of Salana's onchain volume with $543 billion in trading versus $671 billion on regular DEXs. Notably, the report points out that this trend is unique to Salana, at least for now. The report then zooms in on the spot Salana ETFs. Despite broader negativity, they had a strong start to Q4 with 866 million in net inflows, finishing the year with nearly 950 million in AUM. Bitweis's B Soul led the market with 640 million, giving them an impressive market share of 67.5%. These ETFs are still much smaller than their Bitcoin and Ethereum counterparts, but hey, they're basically brand new and still have plenty of room to grow. We reckon the Salana ETFs could become a major support for Soul's price long term, especially as staking mechanisms are added. So, watch this space. Okay, so the next part of this report looks at DeFi, which like the rest of the crypto market took a beating in Q4. Defi's market cap was 160 billion in early October, but it ended up shedding 37%, ending 2025 barely above 100 billion. Liquid staking tokens took the biggest hit, losing almost 30% of their market cap due to ETH's price tanking by 28% in Q4. Overall though, DeFi saw its market share fall from 4% of crypto's overall market cap in Q3 to just 3% in Q4. Then the report looks at DeFi TVL across different categories. As you'd expect, most categories saw sharp drops in Q4. Lending protocols saw their TVL fall by 26% while DEX's dropped by 29%. The report says this was largely due to ETH's price decline, which makes sense given that Ethereum hosts the lion share of the DeFi ecosystem. However, some sectors, namely tokenized real world assets or RWAs, thrived under the pressure. That's because gold and other precious metals were top performing assets in 2025 and their tokenized counterparts captured those gains. Hype around tokenized collectibles also pushed the sector higher with RWAs growing nearly 7% to $17 billion by the end of Q4. Notably, the only other DeFi category to post gains was labeled others, but it's not clear what this actually includes. Anyway, the next part of the report turns to NFTts. It notes that quote NFT winter has set in once more across most chains, but tokenized collectibles continue to fuel trading activity on Salana and Polygon. Sticking with the overall trend in this report, the report notes that NFT trading volumes grew significantly in Q3, but plummeted 46% in Q4 from 194 million to 111 million. Notably, it points out that the spike in Ethereum NFT trading was largely driven by holders rushing to offload NFTts from major collectibles like Crypto Punks and Pudgy Penguins, even at a loss. Meanwhile, NFT volumes on Polygon and Salana fell far less, down 30% on Polygon and just 1.6% on Salana, which is pretty impressive. You know, all things considered, this was largely thanks to the excitement around tokenized collectibles, which suggests that this could be something to keep an eye out in 2026. All right, the next part of the report looks at exchanges, noting that spot trading volumes on the top 10 sexes fell from 5.1 trillion in Q3 to 4.4 trillion in Q4. December was the worst month for sexes with less than a billion dollars in trading volume, a level last seen in September of 2024. However, annual trading volumes actually grew from 17.4 trillion in 2024 to 18.7 trillion in 2025. Binance remained the dominant exchange, accounting for 40% of overall trading volume in Q4. Bybit's re-entry into the top three is also cited, which is a major achievement following the largest hacked on record that I mentioned earlier. Meanwhile, the top 10 DEXs doubled their annual trading volumes from 1.8 trillion in 2024 to 3.6 trillion in 2025. That said, Q4 trading volumes dropped to 893 billion, 13% down from over 1 trillion in Q3. Pancake Swap retained the top spot of all dexes, narrowly beating Uniswap. Next, the report examines the top 10 per sexes, where trading volumes fell 12% from 24 trillion in Q3 to 21 trillion in Q4. October 2025 was notably the second highest month ever for perpex growth after August of 2025. The top 10 per sex's market share remained mostly stable in 2025 except for MEXC which surged past OKX bybit and Bitgat to claim second place. Well played. And finally, the report zooms in on open interest for the top 10 per dexes highlighting the October liquidation event. The October 10 crash wiped out 53.8 billion in open interest, sending the total crypto market cap down 389 billion in a single day, a massive 9% drop with more than 19 billion in liquidations. Binance and Bybit saw the largest losses in open interest that day, $13 billion each. Interestingly, perp dexes saw an 80% gain in Q4 trading volumes, although this was largely driven by airdrop farming on platforms like Lighter and Edge X. Hyperlid was the most active per DEX for most of 2025 until Lighter took the lead in Q4. Combined, the top 10 per DEXes saw 6.7 trillion in trading volumes in 2025, a massive 346% jump from 1.5 trillion in 2024. And with that, we've reached the end of this report. And remember, you could find the full thing in the description below. But with 2025 now in the rear view mirror, the big question now is what can we expect to see in 2026? Well, let's start with the elephant in the room, Q4 of 2025. The October 10th liquidation event completely flipped the market sentiment from bullish to bearish, sending charts that were heading up and to the right into full-on nose dives. you can't help but wonder where we'd be if that liquidation event never happened. But then maybe it's best not to even think about it. Still though, there is some good news. Sentiment is turning surprisingly positive with the fear and greed index moving out of extreme fear. The total crypto market cap is showing signs of recovery and with Bitcoin dominance starting to slip, suggesting any upcoming speculation could spill into altcoins. Some of the key narratives that could outperform include the ones highlighted in this report. Tokenized RWAS are expected to keep growing as institutions rush to put basically everything on chain. Tokenized collectibles could become this cycle's NFT boom, potentially reigniting interest in NFTs themselves. Another sector that could keep growing is prediction markets. As we covered in our summary of Coinbase's recent report, the space is becoming increasingly overcrowded. One possible solution is a prediction market aggregator that acts as the de facto interface for the entire sector. And you can learn more about Coinbase's predictions in the video right over here. And another sector to watch in 2026 is privacy. As governments ramp up KYC and transaction surveillance, demand for privacy focused solutions is likely to grow. This is why privacy coins outperformed in 2025 and could continue to do so. That said, any rallies are unlikely to be sustained due to current market conditions. But here's the thing, that might actually not be a bad thing. Well, bare markets are far less noisy, and that presents a lot of opportunity for investors. Bare markets could give us the chance to do plenty of research to find out our next favorite crypto projects and then buy in at a discount. Come to think of it, this could also be when DATs build their treasuries ahead of the next bull market. For projects, developers are given the time that they need to develop more promising tech that could completely change the space. For example, as AI becomes more advanced, developers can use this tech to create AI agents that can do things that we can only dream about today. More importantly, bare markets are healthy for crypto's longevity. They flush out the weak projects and they make room for serious contenders and they give existing projects time to focus on solving major problems like quantum resistance for example. The point is 2026 will likely be a mixed bag. But there's plenty to be excited about. The key is to remain calm and stay informed. And rest assured, if you're subscribed to this channel, well, you'll have all the information that you need. For example, we talked about how regulations could shape 2026 in a video that you can check out right over here. And if you're wondering where all of the retail investors have actually gone, well, you can find out that in this video right over here. Thank you so much for watching and I'll see you again very soon. This is Lewis signing off.",
        "summary_hu": "2025 végén a kriptovaluta piac 3 trillió dolláros piaci kapitalizálással zárta az évet, ami 10%-os csökkenést jelentett 2024-hez képest. Az év első felében a piac elérte a 4,4 trillió dolláros csúcsot, ám az októberi Trump bejelentés után drámai crash következett be, amely majdnem 20 milliárd dollárnyi liquidációt okozott egy nap alatt. A Bitcoin dominanciája 57,4%-ra csökkent, míg az altcoinok zöme elvesztette dominanciáját. A jelentés bemutatja, hogy a meme coinok és az AI kategóriák uralták a piacot, de az érdeklődés csökkent. A DeFi szektor is csökkent, a liquid staking tokenek 30%-kal estek. A legkiemelkedőbb hackek közé tartozott a Bybit, ahol 1,5 milliárd dollárt loptak el. A jövőbeli kilátások vegyesek: bár a piaci hangulat most pozitívabbá válik, az alacsony kereslet kriptovaluták iránt továbbra is aggasztó lehet.",
