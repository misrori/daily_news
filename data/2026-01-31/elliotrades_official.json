        "transcript": "Essentially, it doesn't matter how accurate LLMs are trading today because tomorrow more capital will be controlled by them. So, the first to adopt and trade around the LLM metas will make the most. Unless, of course, they pivot to turbo dumping on each other, which they might, which they might. But the truth is that LLMs as trading strategies are growing and the ability for them to influence markets will grow as well. This is just something I have in the back of my mind. It's not actionable as to how to like make money with this yet, but it's something that I am very focused on, right? is how can we be early to these potentially mega trends? And I think that this is a framework that I'm not 100% sold on yet. I think that it's a possibility. I don't know when this happens. But as more and more people say, \"Oh my gosh, this assistant does so many things better than me. It's unemotional. It sticks exactly to trade plans. It doesn't need to, you know, deal with its uh excitement or fears. It can just stick to and execute plans.\" I think it's very interesting to know whether the LLMs will eventually start outrading everyone, not unlikely, and then eventually start controlling more and more"
