        "transcript": "I've got a number of fascinating clips lined up for you today. In clip one, Tom Lee breaks down the single biggest mistake he sees investors making over and over again. Then in clip two, the Moonshot guys explain why Open AI building their own chip signals a massive shift from thin software layers to heavy physical infrastructure. And finally, in my bonus clip at the end, Tom Lee shares his view on the stock market in 2026. check these out >> to to tweak the question for this time. I have two questions. The first one being, what's your overriding piece of advice for equity market investors for this year specifically? >> Yes. I I think the most important advice I can give people is that trying to time the market makes you an enemy of your future performance because a lot of investors always only want to buy at the bottom and they want to sell at the top. But when we look at the stock market and actually in crypto too um the only people who really make money are those who are investing for the long term. So as much as I'm warning about 2026 and the possibility of a lot of turbulence, they should view the pullback as a chance to buy, not the pullback as a chance to to sell and and to avoid stocks. I think it's a really important distinction because too many people sell on emotion and then they don't make the second decision to buy back and then they miss out on all the compounding investing delivers. >> And and my second question is what's your overriding piece of advice for crypto investors over the very long term? Um I'm sure it's slightly linked to to what you just said, but but how should they be exposed? >> Yes. Well, I I believe many listeners are skept skeptical of crypto and might even have zero exposure and say that they don't really understand it. One of the things that we have to appreciate is that crypto is being adopted by the young younger generations. I mean, it is a part of their lives because they are digital natives and the there is really a blurring between what's a service and what's money in the future. It's no different than in 1995 when Bill Gates was on Letterman talking about the internet. David Letterman expressed enormous skepticism of like what the internet was because he was the wrong generation to adopt the internet. If David if Bill Gates was explaining that to a 20-year-old, a 20-year-old instantly understood the future of the internet. And I think that's what's happening with crypto today. and and what what how should people obviously you know you recommend Bitmine but should they have a basket of currencies should they own treasury companies should it be 2:1 Bitcoin Ethereum I I think that I I would have a dualpronged effort one is there's something called a Lindy effect I would only buy the the crypto that have been around so Bitcoin and Ethereum but the second thing I would focus on is that crypto is the settlement layer. It may be invisible in the future. Bit mine is acting as not only a settlement layer for the for that for the industry, but with the investments we're making, we are really becoming a financial services company. So with Bitmine, you're not just buying Ethereum exposure, you're buying a company that is helping drive the future of finance. >> Well, a great answer. >> The compounding math of staying invested. absolutely crushes the returns of trying to buy low and sell high. So Tom Lee is making a point that sounds simple by most people, but most people seem to ignore it anyway. The market timing game sounds smart in theory. Buy when things look bad and sell when they're high and then rinse and repeat. But the data on this is brutal. Most people who sell during pullbacks don't buy back in. They wait for confirmation that things are better, which means they miss the recovery and recoveries happen fast, like absurdly fast. Some of the best single days in market history happened right after the worst ones. And the math on missing those days is wild. Miss the best 20 days and you're basically flat. Problem is, nobody knows which those days are going to be. They're unpredictable by definition. So, the people who solve to protect themselves end up protecting themselves right out of the gains. Tom's point about crypto is interesting, too. He's basically saying younger generations treat crypto the same way older generations treat stocks. It's part of their financial life, not some speculative sidebar. And I think he's right with the 1995 internet comparison. The people who dismissed it were the wrong generation to understand it. The same pattern plays out with new asset classes. The skeptics aren't wrong because they're dumb. They're wrong because their pattern matching to their own experience and their experience doesn't include growing up with this stuff. The Lindy effect thing he mentions is worth thinking about too. Bitcoin and Ethereum have survived multiple cycles, multiple its dead moments, multiple regulatory scares. The survival itself is information. It doesn't guarantee future success, but assets that stick around for a decade tend to stick around longer. The newer stuff doesn't have that track record yet, which is why he's more cautious about it. here. So, Tom Lee's talking about long-term compounding in financial markets, but the Moonshot guys are seeing something similar play out in AI. Companies building real infrastructures are creating advantages that compound over time in the same way thin software layers never could. In this next clip, the guys break down where Open AI building custom chips with Broadcom tells you something important about where AI is heading. We've gone from software companies with no physical footprint to everyone racing to control the entire stack from raw materials all the way up to the application layer. If you're trying to understand how all of these pieces fit together, the chips, the data centers, and why companies like Tesla and Nvidia keep getting mentioned in the same breath. I put together a course called the AI landscape. It breaks down the essentials step by step. The links in the description. You can gain lifetime access and the price will go up as we add new modules. Check out this clip. In the meantime, uh Sarah Frier, the CFO of OpenAI, put out a paper and I pulled a couple of charts from that paper and uh her the quote from this is a business that scales with the value of intelligence. If you're listening, not watching on one side is a chart that looks at um compute that scaled over the last 3 years, 2023. 2 gawatt, 2024.6, and 2025 1.9. So you're seeing the amount of compute going up that OpenAI is is using. At the same time, you're seeing revenues uh scale almost identically uh between 2023 at 2 billion to 2025 at 20 billion. And my guess is that she put this out to say, hey, there's not a bubble and as we're raising money, the value we're creating in the universe is worth you investing in us to be able to build out our data centers. thoughts on this, Dave? >> Yeah. Isn't isn't it amazing how most of our lifetimes the software industry has been very dominant with no infrastructure, no heavy cost, no no melting aluminum at the front of the factory and now it's really really moving quickly uh toward physical infrastructure, robotics, cars, data centers, uh you know the the most valuable >> fus fusion plants, >> power plants. >> Yeah. It it feels much more sustainable to me than this kind of thin software layer you know with with uh you know these indefensible but you know user the the modes are basically you're addicted to the product and you don't you don't have the time to shift um but now I think it's moving to much more of a manufacturing heavy infrastructure heavy economy uh with exactly what's shown on this chart as massive investments in data centers manufacturing automation robotics all of that stuff >> my theory is my theory Sarah's getting ready for an IPO, right? If OpenAI does go public and they're trying to justify the valuation and they're trying to raise additional capital unlike uh Meta, unlike Google, even like unlike XAI, they don't have an infinite cash flow machine and they need people to be investing in it, be able to build out their data centers and their and meet their energy needs and and uh I think this makes the case uh that revenues are scaling with data centers and energy. I don't buy it. Love I I don't buy it. I don't think I think this is a correlation not causation uh viewpoint. It's conven con convenient that the two are cup are parallel and maybe in the future, but I think there's other factors that go into their revenue growth and other factors that go into the the energy computer growth. At some point it'll be it'll be positive, but I don't think it's there yet. >> Alex, I'd love to get Alex's thoughts on on this. Uh it feels like there's so much vertical integration going on all of a sudden. You know, the whole Elon Musk empire and now OpenAI building its own chips with Broadcom and uh Google doing its own chips with the TPUs and you know AI is empowering vertical integration. And Alex made a point on the last podcast that look we have this very layered uh economy with very clean APIs. So down here you've got chips, then you've got your BIOS, then you've got your operating system, then you've got your software stack, then you've got your applications, then you've got your consulting companies on top of that. and they all rely on these clean layers. But you know just just the evidence of these very vertically cutting the other direction companies all of a sudden is that the trend of the future because AI just empowers compiling all the way through and and even in the car industry where you know you would normally get your actuators from here and your seats from there and you know it's about a seven layer deep supply chain getting a car out the door but now Elon is going completely the other direction starting with raw metals and coming out with a car on the other end. So you know that is one of the things AI could empower. >> AI is forcing a return to heavy infrastructure and manufacturing that reverses decades of asset light software dominance. So Dave makes his observation for most of our lifetimes. The software industry ran on basically no physical assets. You write code, you deploy it, you scale infinitely at near zero marginal cost. The moes were things like network effects and switching costs. basically just people being too lazy or too locked into change. Now we're watching that completely flip. The most valuable AI companies are the ones building data centers, designing chips, figuring out power generation is starting to look more like the steel industry than the software industry. And the vertical integration thing is wild when you actually trace it out. Open AI partnering with Broadcom to build their own chips. Google doing TPUs. Tesla designing their own inference hardware. Elon building rockets, cars, robots, and AI all under connected umbrellas. Clean API boundaries that used to separate different layers of the stack are getting smashed together. If you control the chips, the training infrastructure, the models, and the deployment has a different kind of moat than having users who like your product. The car industry comparison is actually perfect. Traditional auto manufacturing has like seven layers of suppliers. You get your actuators from one company, your seats from another, your electronics from someone else, and then they all have subco components from sub suppliers, and the chain goes on and on. Tesla's approach is to start with raw materials and to end with a finished vehicle. Obviously, they don't build everything themselves, but bringing as much in-house as possible is their plan. Now, that seems crazy expensive until you realize it lets you iterate faster, control quality better, and eventually drive costs down through scale. The same logic applies to AI infrastructure. The Sarah Ferrara chart from OpenAI is interesting because she's trying to show that compute and revenue scale together. The skeptics are right that correlation isn't causation. Maybe they both went up, but the underlying point holds. If you're going to build AI at scale, you need infrastructure at scale. And the companies that own the infrastructure have structural advantages over the ones renting it. Open AI knows they can't keep buying cloud compute from Microsoft forever if they want to compete with companies that own their own stack. Hence the chip partnership, hence the paradials, hence the whole push towards vertical integration. Now let's take a look at Tomy's view on the stock market in 2026. >> And as we start 2026, Tom, I've seen that you've predicted quite precisely a rally to start the year then a pullback quite a big pullback I think with a rally to follow towards the end of the year. Is that is that a fair framing of your outlook for 2026? >> Yes. Um that's right. I I think it when we look back at the end of this year, I think 2026 will look like a continuation of the bull market that started in 2022, but and and really a period when economic resilience is much more visible. But at the same time, there's two, I think, substantial transitions that the market has to grapple with, maybe three. you know, one is of course a new Fed and uh you know, the market always tests a new Fed and that process of identifying and then confirmation plus the market test can create a correction and I think that in 2026 our view is that White House the White House is going to be more deliberate in picking winners and losers. In 2025, that caused a lot of disruption for technology consulting and for healthcare. And this year there's a lot more industries and sectors and even countries in the bullseye. And I think that that creates uncertainty. You can tell by gold's rally. And so I think those two factors can cause a draw down in 2026. >> Those two factors you said maybe a third. >> Yeah. So the third is that the market is still trying to understand how much is priced into AI and so as and you know our view is still a strong narrative. Uh but as you know um there's questions about the longevity, how much energy we really need, uh data center capacity and so until the market is comfortable that there's other stronger narratives which I think there's plenty like the ISM is turning up I think housing could recover as rates are cut but that transition again would cause uncertainty. So I I'm guessing that the three collectively could cause a draw down that feels like a bare market. So, so implicit in that is what, like a 20% peak to trough pullback or or more or less? >> Yeah, it it could be 10. I mean, if it's 10, by the way, it's going to feel like a bare market, but it it could be 15, it could be 20, but something that maybe brings us to a round trip from the start of the year because we've started off strong. Maybe we'll be down year to date at some point, but then I think we really finish the year strong. So, so when we spoke in August, you said that we were at the the start or close to the start of a 10-year bull market. Is that that's still your outlook? I guess another way of of saying that is once we've had that pullback, you'll be banging the table and saying this is a a fantastic buying opportunity. >> That's right. Every pullback has been a great opportunity. Last year the tariff related draw down was on April 7th turned out to be one of the best entry points in the last 5 years for anyone buying stocks. There were so many stocks that made new all-time highs but really explosive rally. So I think this year if if what we think happens it's going to be a great buying opportunity. Most people pour money into ads people ignore. YouTube changes that. It builds trust, authority and a real connection at scale. One law firm we worked with landed 33 clients in just five months worth $330,000 from their YouTube channel. If you run a business, this is one of the most overlooked opportunities right now.
