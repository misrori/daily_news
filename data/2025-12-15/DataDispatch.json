        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. Hope you guys are all having a wonderful day and had a great weekend. Had some time to mentally relax and distress from the markets. But it's time to get back to work and see what we are seeing right now with futures that are opening uh especially some of the individual names. What's the play going to be? Not just for this next week, but literally kind of the remainder of the year. Are we going to have this year-end rally that a lot of people are anticipating after experiencing a few weeks of some choppiness in the S&P or are we going to continue to trade sideways? We'll be talking about a lot of interesting things. Uh kind of some of the opinions that I'm looking at, what Wall Street's really looking at and also talking about what's 2026 going to give us. Uh you know, you see a lot of different expectations out there. You have a huge narrative that's being played out right now. We'll be talking about that narrative in terms of what the general kind of analysts are thinking. Um, other than that, we'll be kind of just taking as goes. So, if you're a new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos. We're trying to hit 30,000 subscribers. Let's see if we can do it. Pop it up on the screen here. Palanteer basically opening opening in the overnight hours right here. Relatively flat. Uh, down 8 cents. This was just up like 10 cents before. So, just kind of hanging out here at the 183. you know, not a ton of news or anything like that in terms of we talked about this in yesterday's video. Palanteer is just consolidating in this large consolidation zone between the 171 and the 186. And I don't see it, you know, in the foreseeable future making any substantial moves unless we see any big change in the macroeconomic environment. One important thing about the macroeconomic environment though is we have a ton a ton a ton of data that's going to be coming out this this week. We have scheduled data that's coming out this week and we also have delayed data from the government shutdown that's also being released this week. We'll be talking about that and how that could bring some volatility but could give us more further direction on what expectations are for the year end. So looking at Palanteer, I like to use this as a big barometer for how the AI trade is going and it's being relatively resilient. I like it right here. uh consolidating is a good um move for Palanteer especially at this higher valuation in terms of uncertainty that we're seeing from Broadcom and Oracle that's entering into the market. Uh I still like it at these prices and I think it's important to maintain some healthiness here. Now talking about what to expect in the markets. I mean before we get too far let's talk about where the SPY is at right now. SPY is up about 21 basis points up about $146 here at 683. It's doing kind of well and we're seeing a little bit of buying pressure across the board. Uh other than that, data center stocks are kind of decreasing a little bit, but we'll be talking about that soon. Um and the index here closes at 6827. You know, over the last month, the index has really consolidated here at the 68. I think if we see any type of selling pressure at the open, we're probably going to be testing that 6,800 most definitely. I mean, we have multiple touch points right there. Uh, however, if we see some bullishness that re-enters, you know, that's where you're just going to possibly see maybe a move up to 6,900. It's going to hang out in this area. I mean, we don't know where it's going to go. Let's talk about some of the data though that will be expected in the market this week. We're going to get jobs reports, inflation data, earnings from bigger um companies like Micron, uh Nike, and FedEx. Now, talking about the actual delayed data that we're getting in some of the reports, uh looking right here, uh you're going to see homebuilder confidence. It's going to be coming out tomorrow. You're going to see some remarks from some of the Fed officials. And looking on Tuesday, you're going to get US retail sales back from October. You're going to get the US employment report uh for November. Wednesday here and Thursday, you're getting the CPI data for November. and you're getting uh also initial jobless claims and back on Friday you're going to see here consumer sentiment and existing home sales data. So looking at retail, looking at jobless claims, looking at CPI data, uh you're going to get a ton of information that's going to be thrown at us and we're probably going to see the administration that will react in varying different ways. uh you know usually typically they're always you know trying to brush it off or you know have some type of a move for it but nonetheless you know we could be experiencing more volatility into the market here if we see good things on a macroeconomic side that's where I think we could see a push into a year rally possibly we've seen 6900 it's like 6920 is the 52- week high um could we hit 7,000 as a testing by the end of the year most definitely that's not that you know far up in terms of percentage points from here uh this move right here. What we are seeing is a rotation away from the tech stocks into the AI stocks. Now, let's talk about 2026, which I like this. I like that we're seeing a big rotation. We've seen this kind of out of the MEG 7. People calling it the leg seven right now and out of some of these individual names that have taken a beaten. However, the S&P 500 has remained relatively resilient. Uh so, I think this is healthy in terms of these individual names like Nvidia right here. Uh you're seeing the other big names with the MAG 7 all just kind of taking a breather. some of the frothiness is being taken out of them though. We're seeing resiliency within the general economy. Uh I think that's important especially as there's a lot of AI top callers out there and a lot of people that are calling this a bubble. Um that means that we're not incredibly at the top yet if there are a lot is there if there is a lot of skepticism out there especially looking at things like Oracle. We've seen it taking a beat down right here with some mixed type of you know headlines that we saw on Friday. Uh you saw Broadcom that was taking a beating. So definitely uncertainty that's hanging around in this whole AI trade. Uh looking at the AI data center stocks, looking at Cororeweave, Cipher, INEN. Now particularly I do have interest right now as Cipher and IN. I really like these two data center names. IN's at a very important spot sitting right here right at about that 40. Now there was a triple bottom recently at this 40 for IN. Uh we need some volume, some bullishness to come back into here. Otherwise, if we don't, that's where you could see IRM that could even further break down. On top of that, you seen Cipher getting into these interesting kind of lower prices at 1681. Now, you know, this had a recent move right here, Cipher to basically like 20 um you know, we saw this in December 9th right here that popped up to about 20. We see you saw some resistance there and Cipher coming back down here. It could definitely test kind of this 14 area where we've seen support before. Uh so, these names are taking a little bit of a breather. You can see that thing, you know, with Corweave and Nebius across the board. However, in the short term, I am still continuing to be bullish and especially with the long term, I'm still continuing to be bullish on the AI data center names just particularly because the whole AI bottleneck in terms of its actual compute demand is energy and the power energy and power. How are we going to work on that? That's what these companies are working on. Of course, you're taking a higher risk with these individual names, but that's where I'm particularly interested in. Uh looking at ASTS, this has caught a lot of attention with a lot of swinging recently. Uh this had a nice move when it went from 52 all the way back up to 84. Now kind of pulling back here to the 75s. Uh what you see with ESTS, of course, they're working on cellular uh kind of broadcom in space. Um they've have their bluebird they're launching their satellites uh for their deployment in January or 2026 to have about 45 one launch every 45 days. Uh they have the first one here encapsulated. It's handoff to the launcher. Uh so you're not seeing any delays on this end. Great fors in terms of kind of the buying pressure that's occurring behind the scenes and we'll see what happens. Looking at cryptocurrency, let's talk about that. Bitcoin back under 90,000 here. So people people that are being patient are doing a good job being patient and people that are being shaken out are probably getting shaken out quite hard. Uh you know we've been expecting a lot of bullishness or this year on rally into crypto. We just haven't seen that come to fruition. Uh what you see here Bitcoin at about 90,000 Ethereum at 3100. You know these aren't necessarily bad uh price targets you know consolidation zones especially after the draw down that we saw from October 10th the largest liquidation in history. You know of course kind of that black swan event. Uh what we do still do have is like Tom Lee is calling. You know, Bitcoin here is still going to 200,000 in the next 50 days. I mean, I'm skeptical. I'm skeptical just kind of looking at his other end of the year targets of course. Um however, you know, if that move were to happen, that would be insanely massive. Uh you know, and speaking of Tom Lee, looking at BMR right here at about $35, doing quite well. So, I don't think, you know, at some point Bitcoin I think could get to 200,000 in the next 50 days. I don't know. I think it's kind of highly improbable. Uh however, Tom Lee, we've kind of looked at analysts is, you know, he's more often right than wrong on the actual targets being achieved, but it's more about the timeline that actually takes to get there. So, uh that's where my skepticism kind of hangs out here. But nonetheless, BMR right here at 35. We know they're accumulating Ethereum at a rapid pace. They're getting close to about 4% of that supply. And what you've seen uh with them is of course with staking that will be coming out soon. You know, that's going to bring a lot of revenue onto its balance sheet. So typically uh I'm still maintaining a bullish outlook on BMR but I think it's more of a you know kind of hold longterm that's what I'm personally looking at BMR for uh for into 2026 2027 and you know speaking of the actual broader index you know all the analysts right now in terms of the S&P 500 index especially with Tom Lee here are predicting you know this 76 to 7700 end of the year for 2026 for next year that's what they're predicting for the targets however during that time a lot of them are predicting a kind of a strong pullback. You've seen Tom Lee with his recent podcast, you know, predicting about a, you know, 10, 15, even 20% pullback before, you know, moving back up to that 7,000 plus range. You know, that would mean the S&P 500 would definitely be testing 6,000 even below that in the 5,000s. Now, the D, you know, by the dip type of era that we're in, it has remained to be very strong throughout the year. I mean, just recently, you've seen at the 6500s that have been tested, the dip has been bought back pretty quickly and an extremely strong rate. So, I don't know if we'll get that strong of a correction. However, I do foresee, you know, in the beginning of 2026. I kind of agree with this. I'm going to jump on the whole bandwagon right here. At some point, we're probably going to see a little bit of a draw down, uh, a little bit of a breather before we get a move back up, possibly be about up about 5 to 10% for the year. I could see that happening. It makes the most logical sense to me right now, especially as rates continue to cut. and we'll kind of see what happens once a new Fed chair does assume the position. But let me know what you think down in the comments. Peace out. Take care and I'll catch you guys later."
