        "transcript": "Hey folks, this is Tom Nash. Welcome to another video. If this is your first time here, well, you don't have to click nothing, you don't have to buy nothing, and you certainly don't have to smash nothing. Just listen, pay attention, and let's cover what just happened with Mr. Tom Lee. Now, Tom Lee, who's arguably one of the best analysts in the business, a very appreciated guy on Wall Street with a lot of credentials with a really good track record, just came out and laid out some very interesting predictions about 2026. His total game plan as well as certain predictions about Bitcoin, small caps, financials, and energy, which we hadn't heard before and are quite surprising. Now, in this video, we're going to do a few things. Number one, we're not going to call Tom Lee a permable because that would be a really really lazy thing to do. He's been bearish plenty even in this video. You might find him a little bit bearish about 2026. So before you put tags and shoehorn people into what you think they are, leave it on the side. So let's not call him a permable because the man was right way more than anybody else for the past 3 years. Now what we're going to do in this video is number one, we're going to let the man speak for himself. I'm going to play you the clip first, at least the highlights from the clip, not every single thing he said. Number two, I'm going to recap everything he said. I'm going to lay it out and then at the end, as always, I'm going to lay out my analysis, my reaction, as well as my strategy, and how I'm handling that, how I'm attacking 2026. That obviously comes at the end. And if you last all the way to the end of the video, I have a little gift for you. So, you want to stay because I'm actually going to give you something really cool for free. Now, right now, what we're going to do is give Tom Lee the stage. We're going to play the clip, then I'll come back and I'll do everything else I said. Let's hit it. >> You think uh 7,700 by the end of 2026 with a 15 to 20% correction at some point in in uh the second half of the year? >> Yeah. Like compressed in one year will be joy, depression, and rally, right? I think just like last year in 2025, we had a terrible start. People got very gloomy. Then we had a nice rally to finish the year. >> You mean April was the >> Yeah, April was the low, >> the liberation day. >> Yeah. >> So I think because you know the market will test the new Fed. That probably is the reason we have some fear this year, but there's a lot of things to be optimistic about. You know the tariffs are anniversarying. The Fed is cutting and you know the ISM could finally turn back above 50 and that's good news. And you know I we are pretty optimistic about some groups that have lagged like energy is our one of our top sector picks this year >> with the mag 7 >> and the mag 7 should still keep producing good earnings growth and then the financials and small cap. So it's like uh a lot of things that could go right in the market >> the 7700 so is do we get a 10% gain in earnings and the multiple stays where it is? Is that is that your thesis? Basically, >> uh I think earnings will do even better >> and the multiple comes down. >> Yeah. So, it's cuz other sectors are rerating, but the MAG7 might just track their earnings growth. So, that'll pull the overall PE down. You know, if you follow the four-year cycle, Bitcoin should be down this year. But I think that there are tailwinds that are building. And part of it is we kind of reset leverage on October 10th with that big shock, >> right? And now I think there is still institutional adoption taking place and Wall Street is still building a lot of products on the blockchain and then we have US government support. So I think these are tailwinds that help Bitcoin recover. As you know crypto adoption rates are still quite low. So crypto has sort of an exponential growth opportunity because the adoption is increasing. The small caps made an all-time high last year, which is great because that's been a long time coming. And lower interest rates helps them. Monetary easing, earnings growth is starting to look better. And if we have mergers, I I think all of these are tailwinds for small caps. And of course, small caps should have been tracking EM stocks. EM did really well last year. Small caps are just finally catching up. >> Okay, this is very interesting. Now, in this clip, you heard Tom Lee obviously lay out his prediction for the S&P 500 basically saying, \"Look, folks, my target is 7700, but if you stop at that point, you're missing the most important element.\" Tom Lee also throws a little grenade here, a little caveat, a little asterisk, and says, \"Look folks, we will have a 15 to 20% correction sometime during 2026, which is going to feel horrible. It's going to feel like a bare market. Remember how that happened in April of 2025? How some people thought the sky were falling and yet it became a huge money-making opportunity? Well, Tommy is saying, \"Hey, be ready because we might have a repeat of that, a rerun in 2026.\" And a lot of people will be actually scared to touch the market while smart investors will utilize that to buy the dip just like we did in 2025. And that's a very important point. Now, I just want to emphasize here that Tom Lee may or may not be right about this. But I'm all about prepping, right? Even if this doesn't happen, that's fine and dandy. But if this actually pans out and you hadn't made the preparation, you hadn't had cash aside, you didn't come ready for this dip, you won't have the dry powder to actually utilize it and convert it to money later. So now he's coming out with that prediction. Whether it happens or not, you have to set aside some money saying, \"Hey, if this actually happens, I'm going to have the plan to set in motion once it actually corrects. If it doesn't, just play DCA as normal.\" Now, he also says something really important. Now, beyond the fact that it's going to be the fourth year of a bull market, the fourth year of a bull run, maybe not as exciting as 2023 and 24, not even 25, but an above average year. However, he also says that there will be some compression with multiples, but not for the reasons people think. Now, when you think about multiple compression, automatically you think about a bad market, prices coming down and multiples compress, right? Not what he's saying. Pay attention. Tommy is saying look we will have a significant growth in earnings across the board and that earnings growth despite the price of the shares continuing to go up is going to compress the multiples on the merit of the companies making just more money and more profits which is a really good thing for the market. Prices go up, earnings go up and multiples don't explode. As long as multiples don't go through the roof like we had in the dotcom bubble, we are reducing the chance of a possible meltdown in the stock market. Now, another point he made in this video, which is very interesting, he says, \"Look, folks, the S&P will be fine. The MAX 7 will still be great. Those are all great investing avenues, but there are some laggers that will do better in 2026. and those are number one financials, number two energy, and number three small caps. Now, he's basically saying those will catch up to the rest of the market as 2026 will be all about broadening. Right? So far, the rally we've seen, even though it's lasted for 3 years, have been mainly focused and AI, growth, technology. we hadn't really seen financials, energy, and we haven't really seen small caps really do the same kind of damage that we've seen with the Nvidias and the Palanteers of the world. He's basically saying in 2026 the rally is going to become broader and include these which means they'll have to catch up. But he also made a very interesting prediction here talking about Bitcoin saying look I predict Bitcoin is going to go to 200 maybe up to 250,000 by 2026 which is a really ambitious goal certainly is a tall order but here are my two cents about it like I promised I'm always going to give my honest opinion and even though I love Tom Lee's honesty and I love the fact that he has he has the courage and the balls to come out national TV and give out these predictions. and he's really not afraid. I appreciate that and I absolutely love that. But here's my thoughts because I don't handle my business based on what other people think is going to happen in the market. I always listen. I listen to the bulls. I listen to the bears. I listen to everybody. But at the end of the day, this is the sort of thing I teach in my academy. I want to think for myself, evaluate the risks for myself, evaluate the opportunities for myself. And after listening to everybody, everybody is open to say whatever they want. I'm going to make my own opinion based on my own thoughts, my own process. I'm never going to make an investment or sell an investment because someone said it's a good slash bad idea. Now, as it pertains to this 3,700 target on the S&P 500 with a little bump in between that might feel really horrible real time, it certainly is a possible scenario. No doubt. All right now, I just want to emphasize that even though Tom Lee has been right a lot for the past 3 years, he's also been wrong. For example, his Bitcoin prediction for 2025 didn't pan out. His small cap prediction a while ago didn't pan out. He had plenty of mistakes like we all do. I had plenty of mistakes, right? So, the fact that Tom Lee is giving this target is giving you a possibility. This is not a scheduled event. It's not 100% to happen. And a lot of people just assume because some real good expert like Tommy is saying that that he's guaranteeing that. No, he's just laying out a possible scenario and you have to treat it as such, not as something that's absolutely 100% going to happen. Right now, what I think Tom is kind of implying in this video and is doing it very gently because he doesn't want to freak people out is basically saying, \"Look folks, 2026 is going to be bumpy. We might have a 15 20% drop. We might have this bumpiness and at the end of the day it will be 7,700. It's going to be a decent year. Nothing too exciting. What Tomley is really saying here is that the whole easy mode we've been playing on in the market basically pick a stock and let it run like crazy. The easy mode is closed. The easy mode is over. Is hinting to the fact that from now on we have to play in hard mode. The market can still provide a lot of opportunities. It's still going to be a bull year, but it's not going to be as easy as just randomly picking names in 23, 24, 25 and just let it run. That part is over. Now we're getting back to normal investing fundamentals where education and where fundamentals become way more important and less hype and less noise. Now, I actually tend to agree with this and I'll tell you why. Because once you see every single expert out there right now talking about a 10-year bull market that never going to go down, a 15% new highs, everybody's talking about how crazy things are about to get, everybody's making money. Whenever that happens, it usually is a sign that we're getting close to the top. And that's not me saying that. Warren Buffett's whole persona is built on that particular principle. When everybody is bullish, I'm bearish. In fact, I have an article that I showed from the 70s in one of my previous videos where a guy met this big farmer who hadn't had a losing year in four decades. And he asked him how. And the guy said, \"Look, I just look at the newspaper when everybody's celebrating and saying this is never going to end. I sell everything. And whenever everybody's depressed, saying that the world is over, the economy is collapsing, the stock market's collapsing, I'm buying great companies.\" and he's doing that and doing that and doing that for 40 years and essentially never had a losing year without any kind of education in finance. Now, I want to just emphasize this. Tommy did say we're going to have a 15 to 20% correction in 2026. My whole point is bring it on. That's normal. I mean, people kind of forget because of what happened over the past three and a half years that corrections are part of the game. They're absolutely normal. We have three times a year a correction of 5% on the S&P 500. Once per year it drops 10% even in a good year and every couple years it drops 15 to 20%. That's normal. This is all part of the normal market cycle. Actually it makes the market healthier. If we don't have these little corrections along the way which can happen the market creates this rubber band effect where the fall from grace is going to be harder. So these little corrections, they actually prolong the life of the bull run. If we don't have them, the bull run is going to be over quicker. So I'm absolutely 0% nervous about it. I'm also very excited about what Tom is saying about broadening the rally. One of the biggest arguments against this rally right now, against what it means, against the longevity of this rally, it was the fact that it was very narrow. the fact that it was strictly focused on the particular set of stocks, AI stock, growth stock, technological stock, but not so much the rest of the market. The rest of the market didn't have the bonanza that we had in these stocks. And Tom is saying, look, the broadening is going to happen. And if he's right about it, which I think he may, that's a really good sign for the longevity of the rally. a broad rally that includes the entire market and not a particular subset of stocks really gives the bull run a lot more years and a lot more runway. So if he's right about it, it means that the rally is going to be longer, more sustainable and it also means that small caps financials and energy all laggers particularly small caps and financials will have to catch up and that's going to be worth a lot of money. Now as it pertains to Bitcoin, I'm not really a Bitcoin guy. That's not my game. It's not my wheelhouse. So, I don't buy it. I don't hold it. But my whole thing about Bitcoin is very simple. I think that betting against Bitcoin is silly. I think Bitcoin has become such an integral part of the US financial system and so many important people that actually matter have such a vested interest in Bitcoin. I doubt it ever actually goes away. So, betting is Bitcoin that train has passed. So, if you are a Bitcoin maximalist and you love Bitcoin, by all means. If you're looking to add a little bit of Bitcoin to your portfolio, my whole thing is fine. Number one, keep it little, keep the concentration to 2 to 5%, nothing to go crazy about. And number two, just make sure you hold it for a while because Bitcoin tends to be insanely volatile. Only buy it if you intend to hold it for the next 10, 15 years. Some of my best friends who have made a lot of money in Bitcoin haven't sold a single one for 10 years. some of them even more. That's the only way to play the Bitcoin game is long-term and in little bites. So, you never want to bite off too much that you can't chew. And now, let's get to my strategy. So, number one, I'm not going to predict anything. I'm going to look at everything. I'm going to listen to all the experts, all the naysayers, all the bulls, all the bears, and I'm going to have a plan that will suit whatever happens. For every scenario, I'm going to have a plan. If A happens, I do B. If C happens, I do D. You get the point. Number two, I'm going to be dollar cost averaging non-stop throughout 2026. I'm going to be doing that as long as I can continue to DCA. Never going to stop. If the market flies up, not stopping. If the market crashes, not stopping. I'm also going to apply my own modified DCA version, which is if certain stocks that I invest in drop below a certain threshold, I'm going to double down the pace of my DCA. And as long as they stay down, that's going to continue. And when they go up, I'm going to go back to my normal DCA, my DCA X2% plan. Number three, I'm going to be looking out for what Tommy said, which is broadening the rally. If the broadening of the rally happens, that's going to be a signal for me that we are in a rally that actually can sustain itself a little bit longer. And number four, I'm not going to be engaged in any sort of predicting the market endeavors whatsoever. Not going to be buying Bitcoin, not going to be buying small caps financials. I'm focusing on what matters to me. My top three holdings have and will be Palanteer, Tesla, and the S&P 500. I'm going to ride and die with these stocks. We're go through 2026 DCAing into these three stocks, but I'll continue to talk to you about the various interesting opportunities in the market because I know not everybody wants my own portfolio. The thing is, I'm going to be here to analyze every single stock that I think is relevant, good or bad. I'm going to be talking about macro, going to be talking about what experts do. And of course, I will be here to talk to you every single day about the importance of dollar cost averaging and staying cool, calm, and collected and stoic. Now, for that purpose, I want to give you a free guide, a free tutorial, complete a TOZ tutorial on how my DCA system with that 20% modification works. That tutorial is right now free. All you have to do is go to the description of this video. There's a link. Click the link. You'll get to download. That is for free. 100% for free. That is my DCA tutorial for you. Enjoy it.
