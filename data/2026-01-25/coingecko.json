        "transcript": "The universe told me to marry your mother and to buy Bitcoin in 2009. 2009. >> Here's what you can buy if you bought 10,000 Bitcoin with just $10 back in 2009. In 2011, when Bitcoin first hit $1, your stack was already worth $10,000 bucks. That was enough to buy around 15 brand new iPhone 4S at the time. Fast forward to 2016 when Bitcoin was trading around $600. Those 10,000 bitcoins were now worth $6 million. That's enough to buy the peak holy trinity of hypercars and still have change to hire a personal driver. Now, in 2025, where Bitcoin hits an all-time high of around $125,000, [music] your bitcoins are now worth over $1 billion. At that point, you could buy Jeff Bezos's mega yacht or own at least 50 private islands in the Bahamas. So, how long will you hold your Bitcoin?"
