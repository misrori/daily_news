        "transcript": "Gold just suffered its biggest single day crash in over 40 years. Silver plummeted more than 30% in a move that traders are calling a capitulation event. And Bitcoin, well, the so-called digital gold shed nearly 10% of its value in a matter of days, dragging the entire crypto market down with it. The charts look like a crime scene. But the weapon wasn't a recession, and it wasn't a new war. It was a name. Specifically, the name of the man President Trump has just nominated to replace Jerome Powell as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. Kevin Worsh. To some, he's a Bitcoin friendly pragmatist who once told Stanley Ducken Miller that crypto was the quote newest, coolest software. To others, he's a monetary hawk who wants to drain liquidity from the system so aggressively that it could send risk assets back to the stone age. The markets are panicking because they don't know which Kevin is going to show up in May. Is he the savior who will legitimize Bitcoin? Or is he the sabotur who is about to pull the rug on the liquidity cycle? My name is Lewis and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Now, before I begin, I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial advice. It is educational content intended to help you navigate the treacherous waters of central bank policy. If that sounds useful, well, smash that like button and let's get into it. First things first, though, who exactly is Kevin Worsh? Because if you look at his resume, it reads like a script for a Wall Street thriller. Worsh isn't your typical academic economist like Janet Yellen or Ben Bernaki. He is a creature of the markets. He started his career in the trenches of Morgan Stanley's mergers and acquisitions department before heading to Washington to serve as an economic adviser to George W. Bush. Then in 2006 at the tender age of 35, Worsh became the youngest Federal Reserve governor in history. He was thrown into the fire almost immediately. Worsh served from 2006 to 2011, meaning he was in the room where it happened during the 2008 global financial crisis. He was the Fed's liaison to Wall Street, the guy Ben Bernake sent to talk to the banks when the world was ending. Since leaving the Fed, he hasn't been sitting idle. He's a fellow at the Hoover Institution, a lecturer at Stanford, and perhaps most importantly, he's been working closely with billionaire investor Stanley Ducken Miller. Now, this connection to Ducken Miller is crucial. Duck is a legend who famously worked with George Soros to break the Bank of England back in 1992, and he has been a vocal critic of the Fed's easy monetary policies. The fact that Worsh is his proteéé tells you a lot about his worldview. It suggests a philosophy that values market discipline over endless money printing. And this brings us to the big question. What does Kevin Worsh actually think about crypto? Because if you dig through the archives, you will find quotes that sound incredibly bullish. In a 2015 conversation with Duck and Miller, Worsh famously called Bitcoin quote the newest coolest software and suggests that it could serve as a market discipline for policymakers. He didn't dismiss it as rat poison. He didn't call it a scam. He recognized the technology. More recently, in a 2021 interview on CNBC, Wars dropped a line that had crypto Twitter cheering. He said, and I quote, \"If you're under 40, Bitcoin is your new gold.\" He acknowledged that for a younger generation, digital assets have replaced precious metals as the preferred store of value. Just last year, in May 2025, he stated plainly, quote, \"Bitcoin does not make me nervous.\" He even went as far as to say that it could function as a quote sustainable store of value like gold. So case closed, right? We have a pro- Bitcoin Fed chair incoming. Moon mission confirmed. Well, not so fast. Because while Wars respects the technology, he doesn't necessarily view it as money. In a 2022 Wall Street Journal essay, he wrote that crypto is quote software, not money. and he dismissed many private crypto projects as fraudulent. His stance is one of nuanced pragmatism, not evangelical support. He sees Bitcoin as an asset, yes, but he also sees it as a symptom of speculative excess caused by easy money. And that is where the problem lies. You see, Kevin Wars has a track record, and that record suggests he is a hawk in Dove's clothing. So, let's go back to 2008. The housing market was collapsing. Liam Brothers was teetering. Unemployment was skyrocketing towards 10%. Most Fed officials were terrified of deflation and a depression. But not Kevin Worsh. If you read the transcripts from those Fed meetings, and believe me, they make for some sobering reading. Worsh was consistently the voice in the room that was warning about inflation. In June 2008, he told his colleagues, quote, \"Inflation risks, in my view, continue to predominate as the greater risk to the economy.\" In September 2008, the very month Lehman collapsed, he said, \"I'm still not ready to relinquish my concerns on the inflation front. Even as the economy burned, Wars was worried that the fire hose wasn't water, but really gasoline.\" He eventually resigned from the Fed in 2011 largely because he disagreed with the Fed's second round of quantitative easing or QE2. Now, why does this matter for 2026? Well, because Wars has been consistent. He hates quantitative easing. He has called the Fed's balance sheet bloated. Currently, the Fed's balance sheet sits around 6.6 trillion. It has come down from its peak of 9 trillion, but Mors believes it is still far too high. He wants to shrink it. And in central banking terms, shrinking the balance sheet is known as quantitative tightening or QT. QT is the opposite of money printing. It is the withdrawal of liquidity from the financial system. And if there is one thing that crypto needs to survive and thrive, well, it's liquidity. When the Fed buys assets, numbers go up. When the Fed sells asset, well, number go down. It's that simple. If Wars follows through on his instincts to aggressively shrink the balance sheet, well, he could inadvertently crush risk assets, including Bitcoin, even if he likes the technology. Now, this prospect of a liquidity drain is terrifying for anyone holding risk assets. But do you know what's even scarier? Well, losing your hard-earned crypto to high fees or bad execution because you're using the wrong exchange. And that is why you need to make sure that you're getting the best deal possible.

Now, back to the nightmare scenario because there is a massive contradiction at the heart of this nomination. President Trump didn't nominate Wars because he wants tighter money. Quite the opposite. Trump has been vocal about wanting interest rates slashed. He has demanded rates be quote two points and even three points lower to goose growth and lower debt costs. So, we have a president who wants aggressive easing and a nominee who has spent his entire career warning against the dangers of easy money. This is the pivot pivot. Will Worsh bow to Trump's demands or will he stick to his principles? Analysts are split. Some, like the team at Renaissance Macro Research, argue that Worsh's recent dovish comments, where he suggested productivity gains from AI could allow for lower rates are just a convenient shift to get the job. They think that once he's in the chair, the hawk will return. Others point to the Nixon Burns parallel. In the 1970s, President Nixon pressured Fed Chair Alter Burns to keep rates low to help his reelection. Burns caved. The result was the great inflation of the 1970s, a decade of economic misery that didn't end until Paul Vulkar jacked rates up to 20%. Worsh knows this history and indeed has written about it. The question is, can he resist the pressure? If he tries to compromise, perhaps by cutting rates to please Trump, but aggressively shrinking the balance sheet to satisfy his own hawkish conscious, well, we could end up in a very strange environment. Imagine a world where interest rates are low but liquidity is scarce. That is a recipe for volatility and the markets are already pricing it in. And let's talk about that market reaction because the numbers are truly mind-boggling. When the news broke on January 30th, gold didn't just dip, it crashed. We saw the yellow stuff plunge from record highs near 5,600 an ounce to below 4,900. That's a drop of roughly 12% in a single session. the biggest one-day decline since the early 1980s. Silver fared even worse. It plummeted 31.4%, wiping out months of gains in hours. It was the worst day for silver since 1980. And Bitcoin, well, it dropped from around $90,400 to the low8,000s. Why? Why would hard assets crash on the news of a Fed chair? Well, the answer lies in what Wall Street calls the debasement trade. For the last year, investors have been piling into gold, silver, and Bitcoin because they believed the US government had no choice but to print infinite amounts of money to pay off its debts. And they were betting on the debasement of the dollar. Worse represents a threat to that trade. He represents discipline. He represents the idea that maybe, just maybe, the Fed won't monetize the debt. When Wars was announced, the dollar rallied and Treasury yields rose. The market essentially said, \"Oh no, the adult is back in the room and he's going to take away the candy.\" If Warf successfully restores credibility to the dollar, well, the argument for holding gold and Bitcoin as a hedge against currency collapse gets weaker in the short term. That's why we saw that violent unwind. But here's where things get interesting. Is this reaction rational? Most experts don't think wars can actually stop the printing press forever. The US debt load is simply too high. But in the short term, his nomination signals a regime change. So what does this mean for 2026? Well, the Fed currently projects just one rate cut in 2026 and one in 2027. That is a far cry from the 2 to 3% slash that Trump wants. If Wars takes the helm in May, we are looking at a volatile mix. In the short term, we might see a relief rally if he talks doubbish to get confirmed by the Senate. But structurally, if he follows through on his philosophy, we are looking at a higher for longer environment for real rates combined with a shrinking balance sheet. For crypto, this is a double-edged sword. Worse understands the tech. He won't try to ban it. He might even try to push for clearer regulations that legitimize the industry, but he's not going to pump your bags with easy money. He views Bitcoin as a policeman for fiscal irresponsibility. If Bitcoin pumps worse takes it as a signal that he needs to tighten policy is a self-correcting mechanism. This suggests that the parabolic up only liquidityfueled rallies of the past, well, they might be harder to come by under Wars Fed. Instead, we might see a market that trades more on fundamentals and utility and less on pure monetary debasement. And there is one final wrinkle. Well, that's the Senate. Wars isn't confirmed yet. Senator Thom Tillis has threatened to block all Fed nominees. If Wars gets stuck in confirmation purgatory, we could see months of uncertainty. And as we all know, markets hate uncertainty more than anything else. So where does this leave us? Well, the nomination of Kevin Wars is a gamecher. It signals that the era of the Fed put, the idea that the central banks will always step in to save the markets might be coming to an end. Worse brings Wall Street credibility, but he also brings a hawkish ideology that hasn't been tested in a debt leading economy like the one that we have today. Whether he is a savior or a sabotur depends entirely on which version of him walks through the doors in May. Will it be the Trump loyalist calling for rate cuts or the inflation fighter crushing the balance sheet? And remember this, Wars may soon be sitting in a big chair at the Fed, but it won't be him alone making the decisions on interest rates. The Federal Open Market Committee, or FOMC, is a body of 12 Fed officials, including the chair, who collectively make their calls at regular meetings throughout the year. Wars could bang the drum for rate cuts all he likes in theory. But if he can't get the majority of the committee to go along with him, then Trump may not get his wish. For now though, the debasement trade is unwinding and volatility is the only guarantee. If you are holding crypto, you need to be prepared for a bumpy ride. The long-term thesis for Bitcoin remains intact. Okay, Wars can't fix the national debt overnight, but the path there just got a lot more complicated. Now, I want to know what you think. Is Kevin Worsh good for Bitcoin because he understands it? Or is his hawkish policy going to crash the markets? And did you buy the dip on gold and silver? or do you think that there's more pain to come? Let me know in the comments below. And if you want to understand more about why the global liquidity cycle is the only chart that really matters for crypto, well, you can check that video out right over here. Thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you again very soon. This is Louis. Over and out.",
        "summary_hu": "Kevin Worsh, akit Trump elnök jelölt a Szövetségi Tartalék élére, komoly árfolyameséseket idézett elő az arany, az ezüst és a Bitcoin piacon. Az arany árfolyama 12%-ot csökkent, míg az ezüst 31,4%-kal esett az egyetlen nap alatt. A kereskedők kapitulációnak nevezték ezt az eseményt, és Worsh kettős személyisége aggodalmat keltett a befektetők körében. Miközben Worsh a kriptopiac technológiáját tiszteli, monetáris szigorúságot hirdetett, ami a könnyed pénznyomtatás végét jelenti. A piacok bizonytalanok, hiszen Worsh valóban elindíthatja a likviditás megszorítását az agresszív szigorító intézkedések révén. A kriptovaluták és más kockázati eszközök jövője a következő években, különösen 2026-ra nézve, nagyban függ Worsh politikai döntéseitől.",

Gold's price fell by 12% while silver plummeted 31.4% in just one day, an event traders are calling capitulation. Worsh's dual persona has raised concerns among investors. While he acknowledges the technology behind crypto, he champions a monetary hawkishness that implies an end to easy monetary policies. Markets are anxious since Worsh could initiate a liquidity drain through aggressive tightening measures. The future of cryptocurrencies and other risk assets appears uncertain, particularly looking towards 2026, as it heavily relies on Worsh's policy decisions.",
