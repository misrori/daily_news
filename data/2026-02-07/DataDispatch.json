        "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to Data Dispatch. Hope you guys have all had a wonderful day as we finally see a little bit of a relief rally that comes back into the markets. It was nice to finally see some green after extreme selling pressure that we saw basically in the beginning of the week and especially on Wednesday and yesterday's trading session on Thursday. What you see here is a little bit of a dead cap bounce. And now the big question, you know, is this the bottom or is this just the bounce and do we still have further selling pressure? One of the big things that was kind of cool to see and kind of reinsured some confidence back in the market is we saw the S&P 500 that basically climbed its way back to near all-time highs above 6,900 and used the 6,800 as a very strong support zone. You see the Dow Jones is over 50,000. That's what the headlines are popping up everywhere. We're going to be talking about Palanteer, all the individual names, what's looking decent, what big moves do we see in the market today, and what could be possibly happening uh as we get into next week. So, if you're new or returning viewer, hit that like button, subscribe for daily videos, and let's pop it up at the screen here. Let's talk about Palunteer first because we've been talking about that on the channel a lot. Now, Palanteer had a ton of selling pressure as we know once we saw the support that was invalidated at that 150 and we started to begin to see a breakdown. That's where Palunteer came down here basically to this 130 area touch down here even to 129 and we see a little bit of a relief bounce today finding a little bit of support currently at 137. Now, important here to recognize that Palunteer is still well below the 200 moving day average and just because a lot of these names are experiencing a bounce here. Of course, I want to remain optimistic in terms of the bullish perspective. But I got to stay kind of skeptical going forward here just remaining until we see more confidence that's coming back into these names. you know, just because we had a small little bit of a green day here and we saw a lot of moves back into the right names doesn't mean that this could still experience some selling pressure. So, that's where I'm staying skeptical. And I really like this post here in X that kind of puts this into perspective and kind of how things can operate during these market environments. You know, saying that Hood rips 50% and bulls can still be in trouble. Basically saying here Meta barely moved, but Hood really it ripped a lot, but saying that Hood needs to reclaim. We'll be talking about hood specifically on its move today. Needs 110 to reclaim its trend lines and a 50% rally off the $70 low doesn't even get you there. And they use Palanteer as an example here can run from 125 to 165 and only be retesting broken support. Now saying can also bounce 40% and still not be back in its uptrend and that a 50% bounce is still not back. Basically, traders can feast on these. Um, especially here as we're trying to see what the move is, where the possible bottom is. Of course, nobody knows, but traders can make a lot of money off this. But the difference, you know, here is just be saying be more skeptical. Not to marry a lot of things and that basically don't mistake a bounce for a bottom. But one of the big things, QQQ making new all-time highs next week. That is where you could expect a lot of optimism back into the market. One cool thing that we do have here is we got the SPY double bottom right at this uh 676, which is basically this double bottom in terms of the S&P 500 index. You got a nice double bottom right at that 6,800 level. There's been a lot of support here right at that zone at that 6,800. So, we'll see what happens in terms of this grind that we saw. Look at this nice candle right here. uh a lot of buying pressure and this did grind back up above its 50 moving day um right here at 60 or at 690 but the S&P 500 index at 6932 so this is pretty close to some alltime highs now talking about um we're also seeing on top of that before we get back to hood a lot of call buyers that are stepping in we saw a lot of put sellers yesterday and a lot of call buyers and where I'm utilizing to give credit to this um ex account here the Bronx Viking does a lot of cool posting on different flows for different names that are being tagged and just overall kind of market trends that I really like. No matter if it's bullish or bearish, basically analyzing both sides. Now, I'm looking to see where Hood's sitting at right here. Hood had a nice reversal in terms of what we saw today after it was beat down quite strongly. Now, Hood right here had came down to like even $69 in the overnight session. had a huge move, came up 16% on the intraday right here um at $8440. Now, one of the big things about Hood, a lot of people are saying this was over uh sold, especially with this RSI that was at extreme lows, um is because Hood seems to be really correlated with the cryptocurrency prices. And we saw here with Bitcoin that dropped down to even 60,000 before having a strong bounce back up here to 70. you see Ethereum. Now, Ethereum didn't have nearly as strong of a bounce. This dropped down to about 17,800. Uh, now it's just kind of hanging out right at 2,000. So, we'll see what happens over the weekend here as of course these things still can still make some big moves. But, nonetheless, you know, with those bounces and I think some optimism and people realizing like, okay, Hood's probably oversold here. You saw a lot of buying pressure back into the individual stock. One of the big things for Hood, you know, a lot of people say, you know, that it's heavily correlated to crypto's prices, but I think they only correlate for like 20 to 25% of their actual revenue. So, make sure you can double check me on that, but that's if I remember off the top of my head. In terms of some of the other big names that made some moves, you know, of course, these names I'm not going to get too excited about. If they're underneath their 200 moving average right here, that's when I think they're going to kind of reconfirm possibly a trend going up. They just got to do a lot of work to get back there. So, I'm not saying that they're not going to make it back there. I'm not like I'm flipping to some perma bull or something. No, I can look at the market basically in any direction as we're getting new information that's coming in all the time. You know, the now these stocks have some work to do. It can it happen? Yes. QQQ reaching all-time highs next week. That I think is where you're going to see optimism that comes back into the market. Especially as one of the big fears right now, of course, is with the whole capital expenditures as we saw with Google, Amazon, Meta. Even though we're seeing these strong rebounds in the market, the market did not like and sold off a lot of the capex that we saw that was announced from Google and Meta and but you know in terms of what these names have to do to keep up with the trend to keep up with the demand. They're going to have to deploy a ton of capital. Uh you see that with Nvidia right here, Nvidia actually had a good job coming up about 8% on the day. So what does that mean for you know the capital expenditure, the AI, the power compute, the bottleneck for the data center stocks? We've been cuz we've been keeping that on the radar a lot too. You see I Ren right here. Now Iren had earnings of course that did not really fulfill the streets expectations. So this only had about a 7% move compared to Cipher compared to Nebius that came up 17% today. Had a nice bounce off of its 200. You see Cipher is remaining relative resilient in the fact with this whole selloff it didn't actually even get to its 200. You see Cipher right here has held support at the 13s. Um I do like Cipher here in terms of the resiliency. It'll be interesting to see. Currently don't have exposure exited exposure last week, but we'll see what happens. Um in terms of Cipher though, I like it. I mean, it's just a smaller market cap compared to Iren could still definitely have some moves. However, I think we could possibly see a little bit of rotation to the peers here. Uh just because there are other, you know, options here to get some data center exposure. um especially if you know some of these earnings are going to miss a little bit and but that's not necessarily a horrible thing. Uh you know even with IN we've seen a lot of you know big buy big buying analysts that are reiterating these large buy ratings. So just because we have earnings I missed doesn't mean it's over of course for the stock. One of the big things that I'm a little skeptical here too you got Trump here that is tweeting um that Dow Jones here hit 50,000 for the first time. Why is because the last time that he tweeted when the S&P 500 hit 7,000 for the first time, that's where you saw a strong drop that we saw over the weekend. So that's where I'm a little skeptical going forward here in terms of choppiness. What is it going to look like for February? What's it going to look like for um March? One of the big things though here for cryptocurrency, especially with Ethereum, wow, BMR is green once for the day. BMR is right here at $20. Uh you can see Basically anybody hopefully that has is still holding BMR can just take a little bit of a breath because they were able to experience a green day. I think BMR I think what I've seen on X is like sitting on like 8 billion of unrealized loss with their Ethereum holdings. So, you know, with Tom Lee, uh, absolute opposite of the insane price targets that we've seen, but we'll see what happens in the future in terms of them holding that and hopefully they're accumulating Ethereum now at a rapid pace to drop their average cost quite quickly and hopefully get to, of course, their 5% number. So, you know, we'll see what happens. Uh, other than that, some of the other names of course and keeping on the radar are some of the agentic names of course with Zetta and Path. Uh not getting as much love today as some of the data center stocks, but definitely keeping it on the radar. Uh some of the big names, you know, I'm going to be sticking out until we see more confidence coming back into the market until we see more optimism here. Probably going to be sticking out of the super super speculative stuff, staying more with more mega cap names and more reliable names, more kind of these huge disruptors kind of like Robin Hood and stuff like that. So, let me know what you think down in the comments. It'll be interesting to see what happens. Other than that, it's really all that I have for you guys. Peace out. Take care. I hope you guys all have a wonderful weekend. Have some time to relax and we'll see what next week brings.",
        "summary_hu": "A Palantir részvények jelentős eladási nyomás alá kerültek, különösen az 150-es szint invalidálása után, ami 130-ig csökkentette az árfolyamot. Jelenleg a részvény 137 körüli szinten próbál támaszpontot találni, de még mindig a 200 napos mozgóátlag alatt van. A piac a közelmúltban zöld napokat élt meg, de a szakértő a közeljövőbeni eladási nyomás miatt szkeptikus. A QQQ index új csúcsokat vár, ami optimizmust hozhat vissza a piacra, de a befektetőknek óvatosnak kell maradniuk. A Hood részvénye is emelkedett, de a szakértők figyelmeztettek arra, hogy a kriptovaluták áraihoz való kötődés gyengítheti a stabilitását. A technológiai szektor, különösen a tőkeberuházások terén, komoly kihívásokkal néz szembe a jelentős eladások után.",
        "summary_en": "Palantir stocks have been under significant selling pressure, especially after the support at the 150 level was invalidated, dropping to around 130. Currently, the stock is trying to find support at 137 but remains below the 200-day moving average. The market experienced some green days recently, but the expert remains skeptical about potential further selling pressure in the near future. The QQQ index is expected to reach new highs, potentially bringing optimism back to the market, but investors must remain cautious. Hood stocks have seen a rebound, but experts warn that its correlation with cryptocurrency prices could undermine its stability. The technology sector, particularly in terms of capital expenditures, faces serious challenges after significant selloffs.",
