        "transcript": "The moment Trump appointed his new Fed chair, Kevin Walsh, markets from crypto to stocks to precious metals went into absolute freefall. And the question is, how low will Bitcoin and these other markets go before finding a bottom? Understanding this is key because we know that Trump wants to print money to stimulate the economy and to make interest rates go close to zero. So understanding how not to get hit by the train in this transition period is critical because it's very likely that we will see a period of growth after the Fed chair has finally taken office and implemented his policies. So today is all about figuring out where the bottom of the pool is. Now before we get into the charts which will be the main part of today's video, we're going to talk about Kevin Worsh. Now, as Shea Balor says here, if you're wondering why asset prices are getting hit, like gold down over 10% and silver down over 30% in a day. By the way, the world's second largest asset trading like a memecoin. That is absolutely insane. And all you need to do is listen to this clip. We know it when we go to the grocery store, but we also own financial assets. Maybe we own some Bitcoin. Um, 52% of our fellow Americans own no financial assets. They don't have equity in their house. They don't have an account at Schwab. They don't have an account at Coinbase. They're living off their W2 income. And this surge in prices have destroyed them. >> It's the most regressive tax any government could ever come up with. Imagine if we had a central bank that had been deadly focused on that. I think we wouldn't have taken a divided country, made it more divided. So, just to be clear here, he's saying that the single thing that we've been looking forward to, the single thing that we know, the more cowbell, as Ralph Powell says, the yatsi, as Arthur Hayes says, the infinite stimulus that we all know has sent risk assets to the moon, the infinite debt that the United States keeps borrowing against future generations, effectively pushing the cost of goods and services up. Well, he's saying that that's the problem. Now again, he doesn't have a magic wand here, so that's what we'll get to in a second. But it's important that this is the rhetoric that has shaken the markets. And after I show you this, we're going to show you the counter side of this, which is important. But first, you have to hear what this guy said as he's campaigning for Fed chair and why it's so important. Okay. >> When we have a big balance sheet, we're asking for the inflation that came. And as a final point, my own judgment is the story that I hear from many of my peers was the inflation. Well, that's not really the central bank's fault. That's because of Putin and the pandemic nonsense. A change in prices happens in a market economy because of shocks in the world. Changes in prices happen every day. That's not what inflation is. Inflation is when that change in prices become embedded. It's second and third order effects. And that's what's been the biggest harm to the country. My recommendation is a smaller balance sheet takes the Fed back to a a a more manageable size, a more serious job. And interestingly, if you can have a smaller balance sheet, you can have lower interest rates. >> So there you have it. We've been looking at the increase in the liquidity coming to the entire economy. The increase in liquidity that we've been starved of since the top in 2021, since they initiated quantitative tightening and Jerome Powell started raising interest rates. This whole process has led to an eventual swing back that we've all been forecasting. And now we're being told by this Fed chair that maybe, just maybe, that was the problem. Well, we know that was the problem. That's what's created such a divide. But the solution isn't as obvious as it sounds. So that's what's shaking the markets right now. That's why you have silver at - 26%. That's why you have platinum at -17, gold at -9. It's why you have copper at -10%, which by the way, I bought I bought close to these highs here. And so the question is, should I be shaking? Should I be selling some of these metals? Obviously, I bought gold uh significantly lower than where it is right now. I bought a while ago, as I mentioned to you guys, and I will tell you all about the intricacies of my trading plan here in a minute. But should we all be cutting and running? Should we all just be running away right now and figuring out where else to stick our money, knowing that, hey, look, Ebenezer Scrooge is coming to town and there's not going to be any gifts under the tree. Okay, maybe. But maybe actually there's something else going on, which is that this man is a political figure and he's actually campaigning for the job. And campaigning for the job and saying, \"Hey, we're going to make the stock market go up even more,\" is not popular. A very small percent of Americans actually have their wealth in the stock market, an increasing amount as the stock market has been rampaging. But typically, typically the normal people don't get into the stock market rallies until the very very end. And then they get shaken out during the big collapses and they don't buy in again until a decade or so later when the stock market is near its record highs, which is sort of what's happening right now. The question here is, is Wars actually going to do these things? We know for a fact that Trump has been absolutely meticulous about selecting someone who would be 100% loyal to his agenda. And so it seems very unlikely that Wors would try to crash things because Trump is very concerned with the stock market. As soon as the stock market starts going down, he freaks out. And you saw that with all of the trade negotiations with Europe, with China. As soon as the market starts to really tank in reaction to the trade negotiations, Trump pulls back and he no longer is doing the actual hard talk anymore. We saw this with Greenland. We saw this with Europe. We see this continually, which is that Trump will talk a tough game and then as markets start to tank, he'll pull it back and say, \"I wasn't even gonna do that. I was never going to do that. So, it's clear he cares a lot about markets in general. However, in order to get this guy in office, he needed someone who looks independent, who looks like they have their own agenda. But there's no question that being a Trump loyalist is the first, second, third, and fourth most important things in this job description. And we know that Trump cares deeply about lower interest rates and making sure that the economy is absolutely ripping. And so, I find it hard to believe that Worsh will come in and just destroy all of our bags. I don't think he's going to be independent. And I think most of his criticism of the Fed balance sheet and policy framework when he was campaigning for the job was because he knew that he would neither contradict nor defend Trump's view of the policy rate and needed to talk about something else. He was not going to just be like, \"Hey, I'm going to slam interest rates to zero,\" which is of course Trump's policy. He needed to criticize some other part of the policy. Check it out. As you know, we've been following the Global Liquidity Index for quite some time. This yellow line, right? And that is effectively what has topped at the end of 2021, right as the altcoin market and the Bitcoin market topped. And altcoins have been far far more reactive to lower liquidity environments. And as you can see, as this has gone down, altcoins have continually gone down versus Bitcoin. As you can see, the yellow line is starting to swing up here. And so the question is, is Wars going to continue this or is he going to stop the party? And so this is where the uncertainty is coming from. This is where people do not know what to do. And this is what's causing all of these assets to risk off right now because especially in metals there is a lot of profits and in other markets in S&P it's literally near record highs. So the question is where do these markets go? And now we know the deal with Worsh. We've covered Worsh before. When he was first being covered he was considered very bearish for Bitcoin at the beginning. But then again he is pro Bitcoin. He thinks it's a great innovation. And the punch line from this commentator is that all in all, he doesn't think that the nomination of wars matters for the path of the economy or markets beyond it being another step down on the path of Trump politicizing the Fed. This is what we have seen coming is that Trump will control the Fed. He's pushed his way into it. This is a new normal. We talked about on our last video the knock-on effects of essentially investors being less involved in American assets. And unfortunately, it's worth us understanding that in the context of the last few years, Bitcoin has become a non-neutral asset. It's heavily associated with Michael Sailor, with Trump, with effectively America, and it's treated like an American asset right now by the world. That can change over time, but that's not the case right now. So, as people are scared of American assets, which I think is a short-term thing because in the end, this is still the best place to stick your money. You can't go to China. You can't go to Russia. You can't go to Europe. There's no better place to stick your money. So, the short-term tremor is very obviously to me an opportunity. But the question is where is the bottom? And that's the question that we're going to be trying to figure out together. Not just today, but this is going to be the exercise we do each and every day. Now, let's get into some charting because as you know, this green box was a moment that we were waiting for since November. It took us months to get here, but I called this the housekeeping zone. I called it over and over again. And I said, \"Hey, look, we're going to get up into this range above 94K, below 100K, and that's where we're going to either sell the stuff that we're still holding that we don't want. And even Bitcoin, we're going to sell some of that and we're going to raise some cash and we're going to make sure that we have enough cash that we are ready for the bare market.\" And we said, \"Hey, look, if we somehow get above this prior weekly range, then we will flip bullish and there will be no questions that we should be back invested in this market, especially if we got above this 107 target.\" Well, we didn't do that. In fact, we got nowhere close to 100K. It was a very bearish trip up into the housekeeping zone. And I made a video on the day while I was on vacation cuz I knew I couldn't miss it that this was the time to act. If you had some Bitcoin, some coins that you were looking to sell to raise some cash for the bare market, that was the time to do it. It was unfortunately only a small amount of time. But what we said very closely after is that each time we've seen these weekly patterns where we stab up and only have a wick up and fail to hold that range like we saw with this housekeeping range wick. It is a very bearish pattern. And the thing that I've learned over the last few years is that you have to trust the charts, not just what you want. You have to trust what the charts are showing you. It has happened several times before that we have a weekly high and then we have a failed breakout above and then we go down. that we have a weekly high and that we have a failed breakout above, right? And then we go down. And these breakdowns have been absolutely brutal. Absolutely brutal. We had it happen very famously here, right? We had it happen again here. And the very nasty one was when it happened right up here at the all-time high. Absolutely brutal. But this was the time honestly if I was being a slave to the charts and only focusing on charting, which is what I'm going to be doing going forward. I told you that I'm switching everything up. I'm implementing a genuine trading system that is 100% objective. I showed this on my last video, but I have a new Twitter bio and it's not just picked at random. It's not just cuz it sounds cool. Seeking truth with convexity. The point of this channel going forward is not just going to be an altcoin fortune cookie. We are going to be finding the most interesting narratives in all of finance. We are going to be seeking the truth within them and we're going to be looking to do so with convexity. Which means that if we are right, we will make an astronomical amount of money. That's the goal. That is the simple goal to find truths and to make extreme amounts of money with them. Right? So when we see these weekly swing failure patterns like we saw up here, it is objectively bearish. It is objectively bearish and we need to understand that. And then we need to also respect weekly levels like this weekly low that we saw here at 80K. Well, if you guys are traders, most of you are not. I've been trading a lot because I believe that that's the way to make money this year. It was the way to make money last year and it was the way to make money pretty much throughout this entire cycle since 2021. So, it's time to become an elite trader. And that's what I've been spending almost my entire day doing for the last several months. And I was able to successfully trade this breakdown below 80K because it was very obvious that when we lost 80K that there would be at least a gap down here into the 70s and most likely a retest of this prior low at 74K, which we pretty much did. I mean, we almost touched it. We still have a little bit of ways to go. So the question is, have we fulfilled touching this 2025 low of this April tariff Palooa low? Well, that's the next major level, right? So, keeping it really simple, the answer of how low will Bitcoin go. Well, here's the reality. Here are the major levels. You have the low from 2025. That was the tariff low before Trump tacoed and he chickenened out and then we went to the ultimate high. Then you have the prior cycle all-time high, which is 69K. Then you have the wick low. That was when the bullet hit Trump's ear. This was the low of that whole chapter that we had leading up to the uh Trump pump. Really, this began the Trump pump up into the election. And then you have the 200E moving average, which is about 70 57K. Now, if you're just going off of prior cycles, Bitcoin will at least revisit the 200E moving average. I think that this 50k level is like the ultimate end low. But I'm hoping I'm certainly hoping that this 2025 low provides some serious serious support because if it doesn't, that does not bode well. I'm just going to tell you straight up because this is not a time foropium and prayers. This is a time for brutal truth. We know that the future of crypto is bright. Black Rockck is hiring an insane digital assets team. All of finance is tokenizing, moving onto the blockchain. Crypto is the future of finance. This is the future and the big boys are coming. and they're not coming for no reason. But right now the goal is to make sure that we don't get run over by this bare market train because unfortunately when we lost this move it sort of confirmed that hey look this is a bare market. Now what could happen and what I want to be very clear is even in a bare market there are crazy rallies bare market rallies and this 74k level is a massive level and hopefully hopefully what we see is some serious spring here and a spring off of 74 could take us seriously seriously very high. You don't want to be going short and just betting max short into 74 or else you'll probably get wrecked. That being said, if we do break below 74 durably, the next stop is 69 and then the next stop below that is the 50s, right? That's just the reality. And you want to understand the key levels that are at play here because those will help you understand where a pivot point could be, where an asymmetric outcome can be. But the reality is that after 74, the really big asymmetric outcomes become a little more blurry. you're just kind of waiting for the market to bottom and bottoming takes a while. It probably won't happen overnight. So, it's not a a giga rush. You want to wait till people are just so doom and gloom, which might be now. It might be now. Again, I'm not going to say I have a crystal ball. Here's how you know that the market is looking bullish again. If it reclaims this breakdown level, this prior wick low here of 80K, that's a great start. And then we look for it to move back up to this initial range high of 94. That's the simple way to view this. You don't have to have a rocket science degree. Look, we're between these two major levels. So, we'd at least expect to, you know, revisit this 74K and then we'd hope to make a push up towards that 80K. Now, if it's bearish, it'll roll over and just start going down again. That's worst case scenario. And in this moment, it's hard to know what Kevin Worsh will do. It's hard to know how significant this uncertainty is. But, if it's bullish and we make it above this 80K level, it starts to think like, okay, well, maybe this was the the gratuitous fear. Maybe this was the fake out and we're going to go back up now and try for higher again. I'm not trying to predict too far out because we are in a bearish trend that's now been solidified. Once we failed to make a reclaim of this housekeeping zone and this 100k level, we fell into a typical bare market pattern. And look how how would I do this? This has actually been really helpful. Something I find really helpful is if you take a 15-minute chart, 15-minute chart is a really good one, and you invert it. Let's go ahead and invert the 15-minute chart. the chart becomes very clear, right? Here was that uh that failed reclaim of 98K, right? And since that moment, look at the chart. It pretty much doesn't ever go below its lows, right? You have these little lows it hits and it just continues to charge its way up. It's just higher lows and higher highs. Unfortunately, only on the inverted chart, right? So, when you look at it this way, it becomes very clear that this chart, unfortunately, it's rampaging in this direction, right? So that's just the reality. We're not going to fight reality. We're going to embrace it and we're going to try to make money from it, right? And to me, as soon as it starts to say, \"Hey, look, I'm going to start going this way again.\" We can start talking about that. But right now, it's very bearish. And the question is, when do we get invested? And to me, the answer is either you're trading this and you're looking for shorts right now or you're waiting until we break back above one of these key levels. Now, what I will say is the more interesting trade over the last month has obviously been metals. I made a significant amount of money in metals. the more money than I made in 2025 in crypto. That's for sure. I made a lot of money in metals since December. And that's not a lot of time. So, when the oldest and the biggest assets in the world are trading with that kind of volatility, it screams that something crazy is happening. Now, maybe this was the blowoff top. That's what a lot of people are saying. Hey, look, silver collapsed minus $47 or almost 40% in a single day, just a few hours here. Now, of course, if you were trading silver and you were trading gold the last few uh weeks, you'll know that these assets pretty much didn't give you anything but higher highs and higher lows. So, as soon as it really broke this structure up here, it was a pretty good indication that something was going wrong. So, that's the thing is when you have these trading systems, which I've been implementing very aggressively, it was clear to me right here that it's time to get out. So, I was lucky in that I was able to avoid this entire collapse by silver. But now that it's gone down this much, I want to show you something because I'm not fully convinced that silver is done. Right? This could be the end of the silver rally. Or in many parabolic runs like we've seen with Bitcoin, there are many times where it resets to the tune of 20, 30, or 40% and that's healthy and normal and then it goes on and makes new highs. So if you missed silver, what I want to show you is this. Silver is actually sitting right above its prior big breakout and it had a major breakout that led to a huge upside repricing at $84. You can see this$84 level was significant right after it broke through its all-time highs. It had a little bit of hiccup, a little bit of uh traffic here around $54, but then it just kind of went up without any pause until at $84. That's a significant level. And what's very significant about that is even though silver dumped like crazy on Friday and went as low as 73 here, you can see that this was the uh the last support zone it had, it actually came back above and is now above this $84 level just barely. So the question is at 3:00 p.m. today uh West Coast time at 6:00 p.m. East Coast time on Sunday, we will see the silver markets open back up again. Now, if silver sells off from here, I would say this is probably the end of the silver run. But if silver starts bidding upwards from here, I would say, \"Hey, look, we might go see it at least go try to make a retest of this of this low of 100 bucks.\" That would be not crazy, right? And so from 80 bucks up to 100 bucks, that's a significant gain right there. So, I'll be ready if I see an impulse up, I'll be ready to bet silver will actually make a push back up. But what's so nice about this is if it loses this $84 breakout zone, I'm out. So you essentially have a trade here where you can bet on something at 85 bucks and if it goes below 84 here, you can kind of just cut it. Especially if it goes below 74, that's it's over, right? If it goes below this, it is dunzo. Um, but I'm really not looking to hold it and and wait for that. I'll cut below 84. Let's say it does this. It goes down here and then it goes back up. I'll buy again when it hits that breakout zone, but I'm not going to be a hero down here buying a broken parabola. I'm gonna buy 85 knowing that I think it's going to go at least try to get back up to this level, this sort of support wick. And if it ends up actually getting over that, right, then I think we have a case for silver making even more highs and trying to say, \"Hey, look, this wasn't the end. This was the first flush in what was a larger silver run with more legs.\" Now again, I want to be clear. The beauty of this is that if I'm wrong, I lose very, very little. And if I'm wrong, I make a lot because I'm going to be betting on this with leverage. That's how I've been trading. I'm going to be trading with significant leverage on this trade. So, if it goes up from 85 bucks back up to 100, I'll make many X's, right? I'll make several X's of my money. A lot. I'll make a lot of money. An astronomical amount of money. Cuz metals you can kind of bet on in size. They're the biggest assets in the world. Bigger than Bitcoin. Silver's 2x the size of Bitcoin. So liquidity is is easy. You can bet as much as you want on these assets. You're not going to move the chart. You're not going to mess with it. Okay. So that's my plan with silver. And same with gold. I mean, you can see here as well with gold once it broke out from this uh $4,600 range, you can see it just didn't really uh revisit these lows. It just kept making higher lows and not really even touching the prior tops. It just had this incredible parabola, right? And so it went and retouched this breakout zone pretty cleanly. And now it's sitting above it again. If it just continues to trend back up, I'll say, \"Hey, look, let's see if it goes and touches this nasty wick low, maybe this is a place to sort of be a little cautious with gold, right? Maybe this uh $5,000 range is a place to be a little cautious. But if it's able to get back above 5K, I'm going to be betting on gold for another leg because it's starting to look really good again.\" And remember, you have the logic, which is that people are scared of America. They're not trusting the politicization of the Fed. They're not trusting Trump going in and taking over the Fed. They think that America's become less reliable, right? But there's still nowhere else to stick your money. So where are you going to stick it? You got to stick it in gold, in silver. You got to stick it in something that is somewhat neutral and there's not a lot of examples of that. So to me, everyone just flocking out of all assets and into cash, that might happen. We'll be keeping a close eye, but again, the gold trade is pretty easy here. You have a pretty clear invalidation that if it falls below this, you know, $4,600 level, looking pretty bad. if it loses this green wick, but that's only from where it is right now about 4%, right? So, you have a 4% downside here. And if gold keeps trucking, I mean, there's logic here that gold will keep growing for I don't know, probably forever. It's been growing forever, so it might have more legs in this current bull run, especially with the backdrop of all the central banks around the world just not knowing where to stick their money, not knowing who to trust. And I find it very fascinating. I also have a big thesis video coming out on copper. Copper is effectively the number one most conductive metal that will replace silver in the renewable energy trade. Copper is also, if you look at it, at insane highs. Uh, I took a position in the biggest American copper miner. Look at this 2008 highs that it's trying to break through. Of course, maybe it just put in one of those nasty swing failure patterns, but maybe it's just working its way up and still hasn't broken it yet. So, I think if the metals trade remains on that copper will continue to do well. And it might be the case that copper does well even if gold and silver don't continue to do well. But if we followed our plan, we did some housekeeping, we have cash to buy the lows in crypto, and now I'm looking to actively trade in the markets that are hot. Again, we have a very easy way to tell, hey, look, is the metals trade over? I think it'll be pretty clear today if metals just continue to sell off, then that was probably it. But if they give another push back up, it at least gives us a chance here. And we also have a pretty realistic idea that this might just be a bearish runup. But I think it's worth to me speculating on. If we lose, you lose very little. If you win, you win big. We're seeking truth. And we're doing it with convexity, which means we lose little, we win big. And that's the name of the game. And I hope you guys enjoyed this first major market update here in Cryptoland. I will say on another note, uh, as far as altcoins, the main altcoin that I'm actually interested in is Hyperlid. I tweeted about this, but this has been an absolutely monstrous weekly level that it reclaimed. You can see here back in the beginning of Hyperlid's life, it failed to get above this $28 level uh very well. You can see it couldn't close a weekly above $28. And then when it did, it went on this ripper all the way up to pretty much 60 bucks. So, this was really the the big level here. And when it collapsed, it also failed again to get above it back in the beginning of January. But then when it reclaimed, it made a huge push up uh to about 35 bucks. So, you can see this this $28 level is huge for Hyperlid. And if it can hold above here, I think it becomes really interesting. And the reason why it becomes really interesting is this. Hyperlid has gone parabolic in its trading of non-crypto pairs. So you can bet on gold, silver, uh Tesla, the S&P 500. You can bet on the normal stuff on the mainstream assets that are actually continuing to chug day over day, week over week. And look at this parabola of open interest on the HIP3 daily volume. In my opinion, one of the most logical examples of a crypto asset that can perform regardless of what's happening in crypto, which is something that we've been desperate for, we've been dying for in crypto since my first bare market. That's why I wanted to get into crypto gaming because it made sense that gaming would continue to have players liquidity, excitement, if there was a hit game. Again, we haven't had a hit game, but I still believe that a hit game would have excitement and players and price stability throughout the bare market. And that's why I got into crypto gaming was that it seemed like it was decorrelated. It was more focused on a product use case. Now, to be clear, what's happening here is people are trading with USDC, US dollar coins. They're not volatile. And now they're bidding on stocks. They're bidding on metals. They're bidding on private markets like Anthropic and other types of amazing innovative companies, robotics companies, maybe robotics companies soon. This is quite interesting. And there's logic that the fees being generated by Hyperliquid to buy back their own token and the actual economic mechanism if this keeps growing would start to truly decorrelate and decouple from crypto cuz why should it eb and flow with Bitcoin if it's just one market of many on hyperlquid and the other markets are starting to take the lion share. This is very interesting and it's being reflected here in the chart. You can see that the chart is actually bucking the bearish trend and if it can continue onwards and upwards, this would be something that I would be interested in continuing to bet on and continuing to own during the bare market. Now, I want to be very clear. If Hyperliquid loses this $28 level, I think that the trade is off. It is very clearly the key level in determining bull and bare and it's only here at 30 bucks, right? So, it's at 30 bucks. You have a $2 downside potential. I don't know how much upside. These are the types of trades we're looking to take. I'm going to be doing my altcoin tier list next week. Little preview here. It's going to be pretty brutal, but that is the only altcoin I'm looking at. If you enjoyed this market update, let me know in the comment section below. Make sure to subscribe. We're going to be giving you hopefully very profitable trade ideas. I finally flipped profitable over the last month, trading metals, doing my housekeeping in the housekeeping zone, using that cash to start actively trading and even shorting Bitcoin over the last few weeks. And let me tell you this much, I'm so excited to build a profitable community here. Rain or shine, we're not just going to be waiting on Santa Claus. We're going to be making money every single day.

        "summary_hu": "A videó a Bitcoin és a pénzpiacok jelenlegi helyzetét elemzi, hangsúlyozva, hogy a Trump által kinevezett új Fed-elnök, Kevin Worsh hatása érezhető a piacokon. A Bitcoin és más eszközök ára jelentős csökkenésen ment keresztül a pénzügyi politika elmozdulásának következtében. A narrátor arra figyelmeztet, hogy Trump intézkedései, mint a pénznyomtatás és az alacsony kamatlábak, megosztják a társadalmat, ami tovább súlyosbítja a helyzetet. Jelenleg magas a piaci volatilitás, és a narrátor megpróbálja meghatározni, hogy hol lesz a Bitcoin legalsó pontja a következő piaci stádiumban. A technikai elemzés alapján a 74K és 80K közötti szintek kulcsszerepet játszanak a következő lépésekben, mivel az alacsonyabb szintek életbe léphetnek a medvepiac folytatásával. A narrátor optimista a jövőbeli kriptovaluta lehetőségeivel kapcsolatban, hangsúlyozva, hogy a Bitcoin és más digitális eszközök jövője ígéretes marad.",
