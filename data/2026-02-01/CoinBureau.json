        "transcript": "Let's be real, most of us are glad to see the back of 2025. Crypto by and large had a year to forget while other asset classes went ballistic. [music] Now investors everywhere are wondering whether 2026 will be a better year for the crypto industry. Well, a recent report suggests that there's a lot on the horizon. [music] That's why today we're breaking down that report for you in simple terms and revealing whether this year [music] will be more exciting or just another nothing burger. My name is Louis and you're watching the Coin Bureau. Now, before we begin, you need to know that I am not a financial adviser and nothing in this video is financial or investment advice. It's educational content intended to inform you about a recent crypto report that explores what could happen in 2026. If that sounds good, well, prove it by pounding that like button and let's get into it. So, the report we'll be summarizing today is titled, quote, 2026, look ahead. It was recently published by Fidelity, one of the world's biggest asset managers, specifically Fidelity's digital assets arm. We'll be giving you the juiciest details right here in this video, but we'll leave a link to the full report down in the description below if you're interested in that. Now, the report begins by exploring crypto's convergence with capital markets in 2026. It declares that quote digital assets have shifted from informal forums to regulated exchanges, robust custody solutions, and sophisticated financial instruments. The report predicts that crypto could become a quote full stack asset class encompassing the same layers as traditional assets from investment vehicles like ETPs to regulated derivatives markets, institutional lending platforms, and legitimate trading venues. And as institutional adoption grows, crypto is expected to play a bigger role in portfolio construction. However, the report also notes that Bitcoin's institutionalization contradicts its core ethos, namely decentralization, censorship resistance, and independence from intermediaries. Nevertheless, its integration into Tradfi systems is likely to continue, supported by expanding infrastructure and financial services around it. Exactly what this means for long-term minor fee dynamics remains to be seen, but this integration could help BTC become more broadly adopted as a reserve asset, especially given it scarcity and onchain transparency. The report then examines the growing role of crypto derivatives. It notes that crypto's volatility makes hedging essential for institutions. Case in point, Bitcoin's options hit record levels in October's draw down in both open interest and volume. CME Bitcoin futures are cited as quote an effective proxy for institutional activity, noting that open interest reached 11.3 billion. By contrast, gold futures had an average open interest of around 196 billion in November of 2025 with 128 billion in average trading volume. So, it's safe to say there's still a long way to go before Bitcoin catches up to gold on these metrics. Of course, Bitcoin's volatility during October's liquidation event is also highlighted when Bitcoin options volume exceeded 60 billion. This was the highest on record, even surpassing open interest in Bitcoin perpetual futures. It underscores just how brutal that liquidation event really was. The report then pivots to the proliferation of exchangeraded products or ETPs. For context, ETP is an umbrella term that includes things like ETFs. Naturally, the report focuses on spot crypto ETFs, which first launched in January of 2024. Crazy to think that they've already been around for two years. >> Two years ago. >> Anyhow, spot crypto ETFs reached 124 billion in assets under management or AUM by the end of 2025. Surprisingly, most investors were retail as ETFs have become a popular way to gain regulated simplified crypto exposure. Some investors also took on additional risk through ETF options with Bitcoin ETF option volumes hitting a record 40 billion during October's draw down. Not only that, but more banks are also using ETPs as collateral for lending solutions. Some institutions like Caner Fitzgerald even started offering lending services against BTC and ETH, earmarking $2 billion for the initiative. More recently, CFTC launched a pilot program allowing BTC and ETH to be used as collateral. So, as you can see, there have been a lot of big developments. And if you're looking to keep up with these developments in real time, then why not join the Coin Bureau's Telegram channel.

The next part of the report looks at how token holders rights could go mainstream in 2026. But what does this mean? Well, currently when an investor buys a token, they don't have a claim to protocol revenue, and the token's value isn't directly linked to a crypto's project's performance. Instead, investors are mostly trading the idea of a crypto project's success, that is speculation. This presents a problem for institutions who normally expect explicit claims on cash flows. As the report explains, quote, \"The disconnect has been a central reason to treat tokens as trading cards rather than durable positions. However, an emerging solution is revenue funded token buybacks. The report cites Hyperlquid, which uses 93% of trading revenue from spot and derivatives markets to buy back its native Hypecoin. This strategy allowed Hyperlid to buy back an impressive $830 million worth of hype coins last year. No wonder it performed so well. Other examples include Pump.fund, which has used Launchpad revenue to buy back $28 million worth of pump tokens since July of 2025. Uniswap also plans to use a portion of protocol and layer 2 fees for uni token buybacks under its quote unification plan. And there's a which already runs a recurring buyback mechanism funded by excess cash. A key reason more projects are adopting the structure is its lower regulatory risk. As some of you will know, driving value to tokens and coins was basically forbidden by the former SEC chairman Gary Gendler. Some of you might recall that Gendler went as far as arguing that proof ofstake cryptos were unregistered securities. The result is that many DeFi projects, including trading and lending protocols and stable coins, are exploring similar avenues. The report explains that institutions see these tokens as quote early stage equity adjacent claims on a business and expects more application fees to flow back into crypto tokens in 2026. Incidentally, other crypto analysts have also discussed this idea, calling it tokconomics 2.0. But buybacks are just one part of the puzzle. As value acrruel mechanisms spread, competition between protocols could expand token holder rights. The possibilities here are endless. But the report highlights three methods already emerging. The first is what's called ICO 2.0. Until now, initial coin offerings or ICOs have been plagued by insiders with outsized token allocations, unclear lockup periods, rigid supply caps, and countless token launchpads without a clear purpose. Not to mention ICOs offering tokens that don't even exist, as seen in the late 2017 boom. Logically, the ICO 2.0 do model aims to fix these issues making token launches fairer for everyone. The second possibility is performance linked vesting schedules where token unlocks depend on onchain metrics. Basically, more tokens would unlock when a project performs well while unlocks would slow if the project underperforms. Alternatively, tokens might only unlock once measurable targets are met. The third possibility is revamping governance tokens. Essentially, projects could adopt systems where token holders vote on the quality of decisions rather than the decisions themselves. That is, whether a choice is likely to deliver long-term value. In theory, this removes the typical one token, one vote model that gives whales outsized influence over a project's direction. In any case, the report notes that as more projects adopt tokconomics 2.0 O models tokens could be split into two camps. Rights rich tokens and rights light tokens. Rights rich tokens would include these tokconomics 2.0 features while rights light tokens would be simpler and easier to implement but with less institutional appeal. Moreover, the report predicts that right tokens will drive more economic activity on their underlying blockchains especially on mainstream networks like Ethereum and Salana. Now, the next part of the report examines the growing importance of two sectors in crypto, Bitcoin treasury companies and AI. Notably, the number of Treasury companies holding at least 1,000 BTC more than doubled last year, with 22 at the end of 2024 to 49 by the end of 2025. Collectively, these firms now hold nearly 5% of Bitcoin's total supply. The report then divides these 49 companies into three groups. 18 are classified as native, meaning they accumulate Bitcoin organically. So, think mining companies. 12 are labeled strategic, including firms whose core business is stacking as much BTC as possible, like Michael Sailor's Strategy, formerly Micro Strategy. The remaining 19 are traditional, consisting of existing companies that have allocated part of their treasuries to Bitcoin. Although there are fewer strategic Bitcoin treasury companies, they hold the lion share of BTC at almost 80%. Aside from strategy, the remaining 12 strategic companies hold about 12,300 BTC each on average. By comparison, the native cohort averages just under 8,000 BTC, while the traditional cohort holds around 4,400 BTC each. In any case, the report predicts that Bitcoin Treasury companies will continue to proliferate in 2026. Notably though, it expects the native category to evolve the most as more mining companies integrate AI into their business models and compete for energy infrastructure, pushing many away from pure Bitcoin mining. The report then highlights that something to watch closely is whether Bitcoin's hash rate flattens in 2026 as its competition intensifies. It also highlights several major deals from 2025, including 15-year, $5.5 billion lease between Amazon Web Services and Cipher Mining, and a $9.7 billion cloud service contract between Microsoft and Iron Limited, another mining company. If you're wondering why so many mining companies are pivoting to AI, the answer is twofold. Profit and flexibility. Traditionally, miners had few options since their equipment was suited only to BTC mining. Today, that same data center infrastructure is a natural fit for big tech companies expanding into AI, giving miners an entirely new revenue source. That said, the report highlights a few scenarios wherein Bitcoin could become the preferable option. The first is a spike in BTC's price or transaction fees, which would boost mining profitability. Another is a sharp drop in Bitcoin's hash rate, which would make new BTC easier to mine. Notably, the report sees the most likely scenario as a combination of higher prices and a lower hash rate. In the meantime, there's also the possibility that larger mining companies pivoting to AI could sell some of their mining equipment to smaller ones, which would theoretically mean that Bitcoin's hash rate doesn't take a hit at all. That said, the hash rate could flatten as big players scale back their operations in favor of AI data hosting. Now, the next part of the report examines a potential crossroads Bitcoin could face in 2026. While 2025 was a boring year for Bitcoin investors, the same can't be said for Bitcoin's developer community who are debating how they'll implement future Bitcoin code changes. Without getting too technical, the Bitcoin core development team announced a Bitcoin improvement proposal or BIP BIP that involves changing a default policy setting, namely how much data can be stored in a function called op return. The technicals are a bit outside the scope of this video, but the key point is that the Bitcoin community is debating whether nodes should block transactions they consider spam, especially those storing arbitrary data. The op return function is more efficient and easier to manage than unspent transaction outputs or UTXOs, which is the current method. However, storing data via UTXOs is more lucrative. Naturally, this has sparked major debate. So much so that it's been called a small-scale civil war within the Bitcoin community. And if you want to learn more about that in more detail, well, you could check out our video that we have on it right over here. But back to the report which notes that quote the most misunderstood part of this debate lies in the fee market. It disagrees that increasing op return size will bloat the blockchain since blockace demand remained low throughout 2025 as the hype around ordinals runes inscriptions and BRC20 tokens all considered spam transactions has faded. In any case, another crossroad for Bitcoin in 2026 involves a BIP focused on quantum resistance, a topic that's becoming increasingly urgent. This BIP proposes upgrades to protect the network from algorithms that could potentially reverse engineer private keys from public keys, putting around 6.6 million BTC at risk. >> Scary stuff. Luckily, the report offers some reassurance, saying, quote, \"If quantum computers were capable of exploiting Bitcoin wallets in the future, only addresses with exposed public keys would be at risk. Following the best security practices and maintaining good address hygiene can help significantly reduce this risk. The only problem is that older wallets with exposed public keys could still be at risk. This means that a significant amount of BTC could still be stolen by a quantum hack. This is already causing lots of debate in the Bitcoin community as adjusting BTC supply in any way would invalidate Bitcoin's narrative as digital gold and open the door to more supply adjustments. That's why we'll likely see much more attention and development around quantum resistance in 2026 with quantum resistance solutions being a key focus area. And let's hope so because the alternative is truly terrifying. More about that in a video over here. Okay, so the next part of the report examines institutional momentum and macro uncertainty. While 2025 was a bit meh, the report nonetheless argues that structural tailwinds could push crypto to new all-time highs in 2026. This is driven by several macro factors starting with the end of quantitative tightening or QT which happened last year. The report also points to looser monetary policy likely accelerated as Jerome Powell's time as Fed chair comes to an end. Moreover, governments are increasingly expanding their economies through debt rather than spending cuts. In the US alone, national debt has hit 38 trillion with roughly $1 trillion a year just on interest repayments. This has pushed the debt to GDP ratio to 125%. meaning the government borrows more than it earns and that $38 trillion isn't getting repaid anytime soon. The likely result is easier monetary policy, creating favorable liquidity conditions for the markets, including crypto. And as the report explains, quote, \"One of the most significant potential liquidity unlocks lies in the $7.5 trillion currently held in US money market funds. If this money rotates into assets like crypto, then a lot of the charts could quickly move up and to the right. There's also the possibility of stimulus checks, giving investors extra cash to play with. At the same time, rising global liquidity suggests that central banks are making more money available, typically by cutting rates or buying government bonds and securities. Historically, increased liquidity has benefited scarce assets like BTC. And it looks like 2026 could follow the same pattern. On top of that, institutional investors continue to adopt crypto, especially Bitcoin and Ethereum. And spot crypto ETFs have continued to see robust inflows. And if that wasn't enough, the report points to a number of indicators that all suggest that current prices are well below historical top ranges, especially given all the healthy onchain activity, like rising active addresses, a growing stable coin market, and stronger developer activity. But before we get too excited, the report also points to some potential macro headwinds. Inflation is still sticky, and while monetary policy could ease, we're not there yet. Moreover, the US dollar continues to show relative strength which creates a quote drag on global liquidity and risk appetite. Recent events notwithstanding. There are also ongoing geopolitical tensions and the aftermath of the 2025 government shutdown to factor in. But perhaps worst of all is the risk of stackflation where inflation and unemployment remain high while the economy will stagnate. If these conditions stress the markets, well, Bitcoin could take the hardest hit, especially if other tech sectors like AI continue to grow. And another scary thought is that even though BTC dropped 30% after the October drawdowns, well, this is nothing compared to previous pullbacks where BTC has plummeted by 80% or more. On one hand, this could be seen as a sign of strength, but on the other hand, it could suggest that we have plenty of room more to fall. And finally, the report looks at gold's performance in 2025, which saw a rally by a whopping 65% over the year. This was driven largely by people hedging against geopolitical and financial uncertainty. And as such, the report says that a similar year in 2026 wouldn't be all that surprising. As you'll know, Bitcoin is often seen as digital gold because it shares many of gold's traits. Both are scarce, have no central issuer or cash flows, are politically and geopolitically neutral, and serve as stores of value. The biggest difference between the two, at least from an investor standpoint, is that gold is more widely recognized and backed by thousands of years of history. However, the report predicts that more institutions will draw parallels between gold and Bitcoin and begin allocating to BTC. In fact, the Czech National Bank purchased Bitcoin for the first time in 2025, albeit in a test account. Even so, the fact it even happened suggests other central banks could follow, which would be insanely bullish. And with that, we've reached the end of this report, and we'll remind you that you could find the full thing in the description below. For now, there's just one question remaining. What can we expect to see in 2026? Well, unsurprisingly, the answer is a bit of a mixed bag. But if this report is anything to go by, well, there's a lot to look forward to. Despite the lackluster price action over the past 12 months, many of 2025's bullish tailwinds are still in place, even after October's liquidation event. Rising global liquidity, positive onchain activity, and ongoing development all point towards possible new all-time highs for crypto. And who knows, maybe even we'll finally get that alt season that we were all desperately hoping for last year. That said, there are a few developments that could shake things up. One is what's going on in the Bitcoin mining industry. From our perspective, it seems likely that more large players will leverage their advanced tech to pivot towards AI. It's possible that smaller players could fill the gap and play a larger role in securing the Bitcoin network. But even if they do, larger players could sell their BTC during their pivot to AI. Other key factors to watch in 2026 are regulatory developments that enable innovation. The example that springs to mind here is the SEC's innovation exemption, which will basically remove the shackles from crypto developers, allowing them to build exciting new tech that could completely innovate the space and take it to the next level. It was expected to be introduced by the end of January 2026. So hopefully it's happened by the time that you see this video. That said, we probably shouldn't get carried away though. Macro conditions may be improving and there may be some bullish crypto catalysts coming up like the Clarity Act, but there's still a long way to go before we're in bullish territory. And if President Trump decides to spook the markets again with some controversial tariff announcements, well, this will surely put a damper on things. All things considered, though, 2026 is shaping up to be much more interesting than 2025. Hopefully, for all the right reasons. At least let's hope so because our portfolios have been feeling sorry for themselves for far too long now. All right, so if you want to learn more about projects doing token buybacks, well, you should check out that video right over here. And if you're wondering what happened to the Clarity Act, you could find out more on this video right over here. Thank you all so much for watching and I'll see you again very soon. It's Louis signing off."
