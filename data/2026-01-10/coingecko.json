        "transcript": "This is Y2K all over again. They said the computers would shut down. >> Well, I heard the internet might go down. >> Percy, aren't you worried about your Bitcoin? >> That's what most people think if the internet goes down. But let me prove you wrong. The Bitcoin community has already found ways to use Bitcoin without the internet. One of it being through Blockstream satellites. With just a satellite dish and a laptop, you can still access the Bitcoin network and send Bitcoin. You can also send and receive Bitcoin even through SMS. That's how some parts of Nigeria access Bitcoin when internet is limited."
